Measured oxidation potentials and computed nucleophilicity parameters support a mechanism of nucleophilic attack of one partner onto the oxidized neutral radical form of the other partner. Our understanding of this model permitted the development of cross-coupling reactions between nucleophilic phenols/arenes and easily oxidized phenols with high selectivity and efficiency. A highlight of this method is that one equivalent of each coupling partner is utilized. Building on these findings, a nonenzymatic, catalytic method for coupling tyrosine was also developed.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500022	33927912

The binding situation in the corresponding cationic complexes Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CHCMe2Ph)(NHC)(OC(CF3)(3))(+) B(Ar-F)(4) - (NHC = IMes (1), IMesCl(2) (2), IMesMe(2) (3), and IMesH(2) (4) was compared to that of the analogous neutral Schrock catalyst Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CHCMe2Ph)((OC(CF3)(3)))(2) (5). Single-crystal X-ray data were used as a starting point for the optimization of the geometries of the catalysts at the PBE0-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory; the obtained data were compared to those obtained from X-ray absorption (XAS) and emission spectroscopy (XES). The very similar X-ray spectroscopic signatures of the XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) and K beta-XES of catalysts 1, 2, and 5 suggest that a similar oxidation state and charge are present at the Mo center in all three cases. However, charge delocalization is more pronounced in 1 and 2 compared to 5. This is supported by quantum chemical (QC) calculations, which reveal that all NHCs compensate to a very similar extent for the cationic charge at molybdenum, leading to charge model 5 (CM5) partial charges at Mo between +1.292 and +1.298. Accordingly, the partial charge in the NHCs was in the range of +0.486 to +0.515. This strong delocalization of the positive charge in cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene NHC (nonafluoro-tert-butoxide) complexes is also illustrated by the finding that the analogous neutral Schrock catalyst 5 has a more positive charge at molybdenum (+1.435) despite being a neutral 14-electron complex. Complementarily, charge analysis on complexes 1 and 2 and the acetonitrile-containing derivatives 1 center dot MeCN and 2 center dot MeCN revealed that a small partial positive charge of about +0.1 was found on acetonitrile, accompanied by an increase in positive charge on Mo. Accordingly, the partial charges at the imido, the alkoxide, and NHC ligands decreased slightly. Finally, the catalytic activity of complexes 1-4 was determined for a number of purely hydrocarbon-based substrates in a set of olefin metathesis reactions. A correlation of the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) with catalyst activity, expressed as the turnover frequency after 3 min, TOF3min, was found for complexes 1-3 based on imidazol-2-ylidenes. Fe-57-Mossbauer measurements on Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH-ferrocenyl)(NHC)(OTf)(2) and Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH-ferrocenyl)(NHC)(OTf)(+) B(Ar-F)(4)(-) (NHC = IMes (6, 8) and IMesH(2) (7, 9)) revealed significant changes in the quadrupole splitting of these complexes. These suggest a significantly more efficient charge distribution between the cationic molybdenum center and an imidazol-2-ylidene-based NHC compared to the same catalysts containing the IMesH(2) ligand.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500038

Herein, we report the design and applications of a discrete very small bite-angle bisphosphine ligand, namely, FMPhos. Featuring a fluorene-methylene unit appended on the single-carbon linker, the ligand harbors an unusually rigid backbone that presumably stabilizes its complexation with transition metals during catalysis. Compared with the known dppm ligand, it exhibited superior reactivity and regioselectivity in a number of alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, catalyzed by iridium and rhodium.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500002

Mechanistic investigations reveal that the redox-neutral reaction undergoes an intercepted radical pathway to cleave the C-sp2-C-sp3 bond, followed by the combination with copper-catalyzed arylation reaction in the presence of aryl boronic acid to construct a new C-sp2-C-sp3 bond.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500059

Iron-molybdenum sulfide materials were obtained through three distinct scalable synthetic approaches using microwave irradiation or heat treatment in furnace under inert and reductive atmospheres. These electrocatalysts were combined with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and their activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was studied in acidic environment. The most efficient composite material of the series was obtained by microwave synthesis and displays a current density per geometric area of 10 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 140 mV with unity faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution. This composite cathode catalyst was implemented into a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer single cell with iridium black as the anode catalyst and could be operated at 0.5 A.cm(-2), requiring less than 300 mV additional voltage compared to Pt and with remarkable stability during accelerated stress testing.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500001

Heme proteins are potential enzymes for DNA cleavage. Using a small heme protein, myoglobin (Mb), as a model protein, we engineered a metal-binding motif of [1-His-1-Glu] (native His64 and mutated Glu29) in the heme distal site. The single mutant of L29E Mb was capable of not only efficient DNA cleavage but also DNA degradation upon Mg2+ binding to the heme distal site, as shown by an X-ray crystal structure of the Mg2+-L29E Mb complex. Molecular docking of the protein-DNA complex revealed multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions at their interfaces, involving both minor and major grooves of DNA. Moreover, both the distal Arg45 and the ligand Glu29 were identified as critical residues for the nuclease activity. This study reports the structure of a water-bridged heterodinuclear center of Mg-heme (Mg2+-H2O-Fe3+), showing a similar function as the homodinuclear center (MgA(2+)-H2O-MgB2+) in natural nuclease, which indicates that the Mg2+-L29E Mb complex is an effective artificial nuclease.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500003

Although heterogeneous catalysts, including metal-loaded and intermetallic catalysts, afford simple reaction conditions and catalyst reusability, it is challenging to achieve high catalytic activity, durability, and Pd-atom economy together in a single catalyst. Herein, we report the successful preparation of Pd-ZrC, a Pd-based catalyst with the described desirable features. In it, a-few-nanometer-sized nanoparticles of intermetallic ZrPd3 are uniformly dispersed on the surface of nanoporous ZrC with a surface area of 340-450 m(2) g(-1). As a result of the presence of electron-rich Pd sites and the material's strong electron-donating ability, Pd-ZrC achieved high catalytic performance in Suzuki cross-coupling reactions at room temperature. Because a low Pd content (1 wt %) is sufficient to produce highly catalytically active Pd-ZrC, this material represents a great improvement in terms of Pd-atom economy over previously reported catalysts. Moreover, no catalytic degradation was noted over up to the presented 15 reaction cycles as the active Pd sites were stabilized in the ZrPd3 lattice. These results indicate that Pd-ZrC has the advantages of both metal-loaded and intermetallic catalysts, providing an approach to enhance the degree of freedom for designing heterogeneous catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500004

The engineered enzyme directly utilizes inexpensive H2O2 to oxidatively decarboxylate C6-C18 saturated fatty acids as well as plant oil-derived unsaturated fatty acids, displaying high reactivity (e.g., 3,700 h(-1) of turnover frequency for myristic acid). With in situ H2O2 supplied by glucose oxidase, this enzyme delivers 1-alkenes in a more productive and scalable fashion (up to 99% yield). Our directed evolution efforts present a strategy for developing new fatty acid decarboxylase for downstream biocatalytic applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500005

However, the efficiency of pristine C3N4 photocatalysts is still limited by the narrow light absorption range and rapid charge recombination. Here, we presented a facile approach to simultaneously enhance the light absorption and promote the charge separation by introducing alkali metal dopants and N vacancies on C3N4. The introduction of alkali metal dopants and N vacancies successfully broadened the light absorption range, reduced the band gap from 2.85 to 2.63 eV, and greatly inhibited the charge recombination. The synergistic effect of doping and defect resulted in the improvement of photocatalytic performance with a H2O2 production rate of 10.2 mmol/h/g, which is 89.5 times that of pristine C3N4. Thus, this work not only gives insights into the synergistic effect of doping and defect for simultaneously manipulating the light absorption and charge separation processes but also inspires further work to develop more efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production.									25	0	0	0	4	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500006

A ruthenium precatalyst, [Ru (p-cymene)Cl](2)Cl-2 (1), is employed, and the reactions proceed under neat conditions at 135 degrees C and atmospheric pressure (ca. 1.5 bar at 135 degrees C). Unsymmetrical dibenzyl ethers undergo selective hydroboronolysis on relatively electron-poor C-O bonds. In arylbenzyl or alkylbenzyl ethers, C-O bond cleavage occurs selectively on C-Bn-OR bonds (Bn = benzyl); in alkylmethyl ethers, selective deconstruction of C-Me-OR bonds leads to the formation of alkylboronate esters and methane. Cyclic ethers are also amenable to catalytic hydroboronolysis. Mechanistic studies indicated the immediate in situ formation of a mono-hydridobridged dinuclear ruthenium complex [{(eta(6)-p-cymene)RuCl}(2)(mu-H-mu-Cl)] (2), which is highly active for hydroboronolysis of ethers. Over time, the dinuclear species decompose to produce ruthenium nanoparticles that are also active for this transformation. Using this catalytic system, hydroboronolysis could be applied effectively to a very large scope of ethers, demonstrating its great potential to cleave C-O bonds in ethers as an alternative to traditional hydrogenolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500007

Ce doping on the A site of SrFeO3 increased the structural stability in a reducing atmosphere, but ceria was found to exsolve from the perovskite during the cooling process in the air if the doping level reached 20 atom %. The additional doping of 5 atom % Ru in Sr0.8Ce0.2FeO3 on the Fe site could prevent the ceria segregation in air and induce the surface decomposition under fuel conditions for the formation of nanoscale SrO, CeO2, and Ru-0. The SSOFC with Ce/Ru codoped SrFeO3 on a Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 electrolyte showed a small R-p value (0.12 Omega cm(2)) when H-2 and ambient air were used as fuel and oxidant, respectively. The peak power densities of 846 and 310 mW cm(-2) were achieved at 800 degrees C using H-2 and C3H8 as fuel, respectively. The excellent coke resistance of the anode could be related to the simultaneous in situ exsolution of CeO2, SrO, and Ru-0 nanoparticles.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500008

We proposed a coordination structure of the Ni center in the precatalyst based on elemental analysis and Ni K-edge XANES, and we confirmed that it is consistent with Ni K-edge EXAFS. The Suzuki-Miyaura-type coupling of aryl halides and arylboronic esters proceeded using P4VP-NiCl2 (0.1 mol % Ni) to give the corresponding biaryl compounds in up to 94% yield. Surprisingly, when the same reaction of aryl halides and arylboronic acid/ester was carried out in the presence of amides, the amidation proceeded predominantly to give the corresponding arylamides in up to 99% yield. In contrast, the reaction of aryl halides and amides in the absence of arylboronic acid/ester did not proceed. P4VP-NiCl2 successfully catalyzed the lactamization for preparing phenanthridinone. P4VP-NiCl2 was reused five times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biologically active compounds were synthesized efficiently using P4VP-NiCl2 catalysis. Nickel contamination in the prepared pharmaceutical compounds was not detected by ICP-MS analysis. The reaction was scaled to multigrams without any loss of chemical yield. Mechanistic studies for both Suzuki-Miyaura and amidation were performed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500009

It is well-known that the structures of metal catalysts determine their properties. However, recent studies suggested that the structures of metal catalysts change dynamically under reaction conditions, resulting in the deactivation or activation of metal catalysts. This Review summarizes the latest research progresses in the structural reconstruction of metal catalysts via controlled-atmosphere transmission electron microscopy. The state-of-the-art research technologies and crucial factors affecting the nanosized metal catalyst reconstruction are discussed. Various types of reconstruction phenomena are reviewed, including sintering and dispersion, reshaping, composition evolution, surface reconstruction of metal oxides, and strong metal-support interactions. Moreover, recent studies of the structure-property relationship of metal catalysts are also reviewed. Finally, we highlight current challenges and provide the perspectives for future research of this topic.

In an effort to capitalize on recent progress in the development of functional enzyme mimics for the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds, we developed cross-linked microgels with embedded binuclear copper(II) complexes that are shown here to hydrolyze 1.4 over 1.6 glycosidic bonds under mildly alkaline conditions at elevated temperatures. The microgel catalysts show an unusual preference for the hydrolysis of 1 -> 4 beta- over 1 -> 4 alpha-glycosidic bonds yielding up to 25 mu g L-1 of glucose from cellobiose over 72 h and about half of that during the hydrolysis of maltose after correction for background effects. The experimental results are supported by computational analyses of the interactions between the embedded catalyst and the nonactivated disaccharide in putative transition state structures of the assembly during hydrolysis of the nonactivated glycosidic bond to rationalize this observation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500011

This is often approached through the development of dynamic catalyst (or initiator) systems that use external stimuli to elicit discrete, site-specific transformations that impact the polymerization. Herein we highlight developments in polymerizations that are modulated by external stimuli, with particular focus on those systems that enable notable changes in kinetics, monomer selectivity, polymer architecture, or tacticity.

Alkali metals as promoters are generally crucial for Cu-Fe-based catalysts, but their critical role in higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) is still far from clear. Here, we report the regulating effect of a potassium (K) promoter from a reactant activation perspective on Cu-Fe-based catalysts for HAS from CO2 hydrogenation using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and chemisorption methods. The optimized catalyst denoted as 4.6K-CMZF with a moderate K content exhibits the highest HA space time yield (STY) in a fixed-bed reactor. It is found that the K can promote reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and tailor the ratio of nondissociated CO to dissociated CO by strengthening linear CO adsorption and weakening bridging CO adsorption. A proper amount of K can balance the nondissociated and dissociated activation of CO, thus providing an adequate *CHx and *CO species to take part in *CHx-*CO coupling reaction. The K promoter can also suppress H-2 activation, thereby inhibiting alkylation reaction. The promoting effect of K can be attributed to the balance of surface *CHx, *CO, and *H species by regulating CO activation and H-2 activation, thus favoring HA synthesis via *CHx-*CO coupling and hydrogenation reactions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500013

A major issue, however, is the stability of these materials in acidic environments and at potentials experienced in situ in PEFC cathodes and rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments. Density functional theory (DFT)-based approaches have been valuable to understand how atomic scale structures couple to ORR activity. Little has been reported, however, on quantification of active site structure stability. This work proposes a set of DFT-accessible descriptors for M dissolution (demetalation) that directly address this need. Through the application of this approach to a specific Fe-N-4 bilayer graphene-hosted active site structure, the roles of the environment (pH and potential), ORR intermediates, and graphene underlayers are explored. Ranges of stability are reported and hypotheses explaining previously reported experimental behavior based on these findings are proposed. In particular, proposed are model implications for experimental trends in stability with respect to alkaline and acidic conditions; experimental trends for dissolution to occur below a given potential; and observed discrepancies in stability for materials in O-2-bearing vs O-2-purged environments. Based on these findings, suggestions for improving active site resistance to metal dissolution are provided.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500014

To allow the knowledge-driven development of improved catalysts, it is necessary to deeply understand the fundamental aspects of the FAOR, which can be ideally achieved by investigating highly active model catalysts. Here, we studied SnO2-decorated Pd nanocubes (NCs) exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance for formic acid oxidation in acidic medium with a SnO2 promotion that boosts the catalytic activity by a factor of 5.8, compared to pure Pd NCs, exhibiting values of 2.46 A mg(-1) Pd for SnO2@Pd NCs versus 0.42 A mg(-1) Pd for the Pd NCs and a 100 mV lower peak potential. By using ex situ, quasi in situ, and operando spectroscopic and microscopic methods (namely, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy), we identified that the initially well-defined SnO2-decorated Pd nanocubes maintain their structure and composition throughout FAOR. In situ Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy revealed a weaker CO adsorption site in the case of the SnO2-decorated Pd NCs, compared to the monometallic Pd NCs, enabling a bifunctional reaction mechanism. Therein, SnO2 provides oxygen species to the Pd surface at low overpotentials, promoting the oxidation of the poisoning CO intermediate and, thus, improving the catalytic performance of Pd. Our SnOx-decorated Pd nanocubes allowed deeper insight into the mechanism of FAOR and hold promise for possible applications in direct formic acid fuel cells.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500015	33362944

The catalytic activity for aromatic C-H borylation was significantly affected by (i) the linker length of the Ir-bipyridine complex, (ii) the coimmobilized organic functionality, and (iii) the substituents on the aromatic substrate compounds. The fine-tuned supported catalyst showed higher activity than the homogeneous Ir-bipyridine complex when using a specific substrate such as benzonitrile. We elucidated this property by conducting solid-state NMR, FT-IR, XAFS, and in situ FT-IR analysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500016

Herein, we reported a metal-free CeO2 nanorods (rCeO(2)) catalyst for gas-phase transformation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol with the highest selectivity of 93.2% at 323 K. Compared to CeO2 nanocubes and nanopolydra, r-CeO2 shows a much higher crotyl alcohol production rate, comparable turnover frequency to those of noble-metalbased catalysts, and very high crotyl alcohol selectivity. This can be associated with a relatively high density of surface oxygen vacancies on rCeO(2), which constructs the solid frustrated Lewis pair sites with enhanced heterolytic H-2 dissociation and preferred crotonaldehyde adsorption via the C=O bond. However, a further reduction of r-CeO2 by H-2 was observed to be unfavorable with regard to both catalytic activity and selectivity, because of the emergence of crotonaldehyde adsorption via the C=C bond. These findings provide a potential approach to fabricate high-performance and low-cost catalysts for selective hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols using bare CeO2 with a rigid surface structure design.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500017

The intrinsically highly active Pt/Pd/C catalyst with an ORR mass activity of ca. 1000 A g(-1)-Pt at 0.9 V versus RHE was synthesized by a direct displacement reaction method, and the activity was activated to ca. 1500 A g(-1)-Pt via a high activation protocol (HAP) (a rectangular potential cycling of 0.05-1.0 V vs an RHE conducted in 0.1 mol dm(-3) HClO4 under an Ar atmosphere at 80 degrees C). The ORR activities of the Pt/Pd/C catalysts were further increased by surface decoration with melamine or tBuTAP, and the mass activity of ORR of the catalyst activated by an HAP was enhanced to 3625 A g(-1)-Pt at 0.9 V versus RHE via the melamine decoration, which is about 11-fold that of a reference Pt/C catalyst (320 A g(-1)-Pt). Cyclic voltammograms, linear sweep voltammograms, and CO stripping voltammograms indicated that the surface decoration further destabilized the OH species (OHad) adsorbed on the Pt shell and suppressed the formation of oxide on the Pt shell, which could explain the extraordinary enhancement of ORR activity. We present guidelines for creating Pt-based catalysts with extraordinarily high activity for the ORR by the synergistic combination of the intrinsically active Pt-based catalyst [improvement from the inside of Pt nanoparticles (NPs)] and surface decoration (improvement from the outside of Pt NPs).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500018

A supported nickel-based catalyst is the most promising candidate for the CO2 methanation reaction. Additionally, understanding the role of the support is essential for the rational design of nickel-based CO2 methanation catalysts. Herein, we elaborated on the effect of the support on the catalyst structure, CO2 adsorption, CO2 activation, methanation mechanism, and deactivation process. Future directions are suggested to elucidate the fundamental aspects of this catalytic system, including the formation mechanism of preferentially exposed facets, the nature of strong metal-support interactions, the balance between support reducibility and basicity, and the CO2 methanation pathways over nickel-based catalysts with various supports.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500019

The efficient electrosynthesis of NH3 is challenging because of the lower activation of N-2 and higher activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we propose theory-guided activity descriptors to identify an efficient N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) catalyst, followed by its implementation in a flow-through gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to quantify the effects of pH, cation identity, H2O saturation, and N-2 concentration on the kinetics of the NRR. The identified Cu catalyst with dominant (111) facets electrodeposited on a carbon paper provides optimal active sites to obtain maximum NH3 faradaic efficiency (FE) of 18 +/- 3% at-0.3 V vs RHE and the maximum NH3 current density of 0.25 +/- 0.03 mA cm(-2) (0.86 nmol.cm(-2).s(-1)) at-0.5 V vs RHE in alkaline medium. The electrolyte pH mostly affects the HER by pH-induced binding of *H and reorganization of H2O, which favor the NRR at an optimal pH of 13.5. Increasing the size of monovalent cations stabilizes NRR intermediates and increases the NH3 current density from Li+ to K+. However, increasing the size of the cation from K+ to Rb+ reduces the FE of NRR, which is due to a direct reduction of H2O in the solvation shell of larger cations to produce H-2. Another strategy to improve NH3 FE is to reduce the H2O saturation on the catalyst, which can be achieved by sparging the reactant gas directly through the GDE. Increasing the N-2(g) flow rate not only increases the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient but also reduces the H2O saturation in the pores of the GDE, which primarily suppresses the HER. The fixed potential DFT calculations reveal an associative distal mechanism for the NRR over Cu(111), where the hydrogenation of *N-2 is the rate-limiting step. This finding also corroborates with the measured reaction order with respect to N-2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500020

However, the powder form of nanocarbons limits their industrial applications because of the large pressure drop in a fixed-bed reactor and the big difficulties in handling loose powder in a fluidized-bed reactor. To address these issues, herein, we report a general poly(imidazolium-methylene)-assisted grinding strategy for synthesizing mechanically robust nanocarbon-embedded network monoliths by grinding a mixture composed of nanocarbons and the as-formed poly(imidazolium-methylene) chloride (PImM) with a subsequent pyrolysis process. The as-prepared nanocarbon-based network monoliths feature nanocarbons to be well-dispersed within a N-doped carbon (NC) network. The monolith is adequately hard and high density and can be cracked and sieved into granule nanocarbon catalysts. Taking nanodiamonds (NDs) as an example, in the grinding procedure, PImM can penetrate into ND aggregates to disperse NDs and can adhere the deagglomerated NDs because there is a strong interaction between NDs and PImM through strong cation-p interactions, pi-pi interactions, and electrostatic interactions since many nanocarbons including NDs have negative charges on their surface. The designed PImM plays three roles in the preparation of ND-embedded network monolith including the adhering agent, isolating agent, and a precursor of the NC network. The resulting granule ND@NC carbocatalyst from its corresponding ND@NC network monolith shows 6.39 mmol g(-1) h(-1) of steady-state styrene rate (9.26 and 2.24 times higher compared to that of NC and ND, respectively) with 99.0% of styrene selectivity for ethylbenzene direct dehydrogenation (EDH) to styrene, a commercially important reaction. The granule ND@NC carbocatalyst also shows high catalytic stability for EDH reaction. The strategy has been extended to carbon nanofiber-embedded monoliths. This work not only creates a granule carbocatalyst for styrene production via EDH reaction but also paves an avenue to overcome the bottleneck problems regarding the applications of the powders of diverse nanocarbons in heterogeneous catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500021

CeO2 support was superior to other conventional supports in view of the activity of supported iron catalysts. The effect of iron loading amount on CeO2 supports showed a linear relationship with an iron loading amount up to 3 wt %, which corresponded to "monolayer" coverage, and then it was almost constant with a further increase of the iron content. The Fe/CeO2 catalyst with 3 wt % iron loading (Fe(3)/CeO2) had higher stability than the catalysts with higher iron loadings. The optimal Fe(3)/CeO2 catalyst showed a 56% phenol yield and an 87% sum yield of phenol and methylated phenols at 673 K under guaiacol/N-2/H-2 = 1/45/135 flow with W/F = 1.0 g.h.mol(total)(-1). The X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DRUV-vis), Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterizations confirmed that the FeOx species were finely dispersed on the Fe/CeO2 catalyst with <= 3 wt % iron, and higher iron loadings led to formation of Fe2O3 particles in calcined catalysts. Although other supported iron catalysts with 3 wt % iron loading also contained dispersed FeOx species, the reducibility of Fe/CeO2 was higher than that of other supported iron catalysts, which might be related to the higher activity. The XAS characterization of spent catalysts showed that the stable Fe(3)/CeO2 catalyst contained only Fe3+ and Fe2+ species during the reaction, while in the Fe(10)/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of iron proceeded to a greater extent and Fe3C crystals grew during the reaction. The structure of this monolayer Fe(3)/CeO2 was further characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Rather than a two-dimensional Fe oxide sheet, a structure composed of dispersed Fe4O6 clusters is suggested for monolayer coverage. The coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS) in the interface between FeOx and reducible CeO2 is suggested to be the active site.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500023

In this work, two Ir0.5Ni0.5Ox mixed oxide catalysts with layered and solid solution morphologies were prepared by modifying a facile hydrothermal methodology. The catalytic OER activity and stability of the Ir-Ni catalyst with a homogeneous distribution (IrNi-HD) was seriously compromised compared to pure IrOx due to the high concentration of surface nickel prone to corrosion under reaction conditions. However, the design of layered IrOx-Ni(OH)(x) (IrNi-LY) with Ir at the exposed surface allowed a 50% reduction in the molar concentration of the precious metal on the electrode compared to IrOx without impairing the catalytic activity or stability. As a result, IrNi-LY outperformed IrOx in activity when normalized to the Ir mass.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500024

One of the reasons for the low OER performance is related to the existence of different types of surface states at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface: recombining surface states (r-SS) and surface states due to intermediate species (i-SS). Since the impact of surface states on OER is still under debate, we investigate how different types of surface states affect PEC water oxidation and how they impact experimental measurements. In a new computational approach, we combine a microkinetic model of the OER on the semiconductor surface with the charge carrier dynamics within the semiconductor. The impact of r-SS and i-SS on the current-voltage curves, hole flux, surface state capacitance, Mott-Schottky plots, and chopped light measurements is systematically investigated. It is found that (a) r-SS results in a capacitance peak below the OER onset potential, while i-SS results in a capacitance peak around the onset potential; (b) r-SS leads to an increase in the OER onset potential and a decrease in the saturation current density; (c) r-SS leads to Fermi-level pinning before the onset potential, while i-SS does not result in Fermi-level pinning; and (d) a smaller capacitance peak of i-SS can be an indication of the lower catalytic performance of the semiconductor surface. Our approach in combination with experimental comparison allows distinguishing the impact of r-SS and i-SS in PEC experiments. We conclude that r-SS reduces the OER performance and i-SS mediates the OER.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500025

The present study concerns the effect of Co and Ni substituents in the ferrite (Fe3O4) structure used as a catalyst precursor for medium-temperature Fischer-Tropsch (MTFT) synthesis, in anticipation of enhanced oxygenate selectivities. The ferrites were synthesized by co-precipitation and characterized in detail before and after exposure to MTFT conditions, employing both conventional ex situ and state of the art in situ techniques. The complex product spectrum from the MTFT was analyzed by combining off-line one-dimensional and on-line two-dimensional gas chromatography. The latter was used specifically to investigate the formation of minority species, such as oxygenates, which are often disregarded in literature. In situ XRD and magnetometry showed no notable change in the reduction behavior of the ferrites with a cobalt substituent, but substituting with Ni decreased the reduction temperature drastically from 315 to 250 degrees C, most likely due to the increased hydrogen dissociation activity of Ni. The activity, CO conversion, in MTFT increased in the order Fe << CoFe < NiFe < CoNiFe. Incorporation of Co and Ni in the catalysts makes them less prone to deposition of inactive carbon. The addition of Ni specifically, also results in a significant shift in selectivity toward a shorter average chain length, lower olefinicity and higher water-gas shift activity. Interestingly, these shifts are paralleled by a 76% or 170% increase in C2+ oxygenates selectivity or yield, respectively. The increase in hydrogenation activity of substituted (i.e., Co and/or Ni) Fe-based catalysts, plays a critical role in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis activity and selectivity to the different product classes (i.e., paraffins, olefins, and oxygenates) and the findings reported here provide valuable insights of key importance for further development and optimization of FT catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500026

Here, the pure TiO2 nanoparticles, obtained through in situ reduction, exhibit excellent catalytic PDH performance. At 600 degrees C, the initial propane conversion could reach 67%, and the one-pass yield of propylene was 45%. The propane conversion was 21% at 550 degrees C, and propene selectivity could reach as high as 94%. According to ex/in situ characterization results and Quantum chemical calculations, the dynamic formation and reaction mechanism of active sites were detailedly investigated. The reductive propane and its derivatives can react with surface lattice oxygen of nanosized anatase TiO2 to form oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti cations (Ti-cus), which can catalyze PDH with high propene selectivity; the rate of C3H6 formation is in line with the surface oxygen vacancy concentration. Notably, the Ostwald ripening of nanosized TiO2 with high surface energy is crucial to the formation of oxygen vacancies. The agglomeration of nanosized TiO2 at high temperature makes the lattice oxygen atoms mobile and active, which are consumed abruptly and then form oxygen vacancies and Ti-cus more easily. It is denoted as "mutation reduction". The surface oxygen vacancy concentration is also influenced by the oxygen migration rate from bulk to surface driven by thermal energy and potential energy (the differences of concentration).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500027

However, their catalytic performance highly depends on supports, and the real evolution of Cu species is still covered by active components. Herein, we supply a Cu/SiO2 catalyst prepared by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), showing catalytic performance comparable to that of the active Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for methanol synthesis from CO2. It reaches 79% selectivity at a CO2 conversion of 5.2%, which is an outstanding selectivity among previously reported Cu/SiO2 catalysts, considering they are generally treated as nearly inert catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis shows that 5 times more Cu+ species in the FSP-Cu/SiO2 are stabilized in comparison to those in the traditional ammonia evaporation (AE) made catalyst even after reduction at 350 degrees C. A unique shattuckite-like precursor with a slightly distorted Cu-O-Si texture structure formed in the FSP-made catalyst is responsible for the enriched Cu+ species. Variations of intermediate formation and methanol production are found to have a good relationship with the amount of Cu+ species. According to the results of high-pressure in situ DRIFTS, we attribute this to the promotional effect of Cu+ on the stabilization of CO* intermediates, which inhibits CO desorption and facilitates further hydrogenation to CH3OH via the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathway. These results bring insights into the Cu reduction behavior and the function of Cu+ species during methanol production on Cu-based catalysts without the assistance of active supports.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500028

However, it is challenging to enhance the HMF yield due to side reactions. In this study, a systematic approach combining theory and experiment was performed to investigate the influence of Lewis acids and organic solvents on the HMF yield. For the Lewis acid effect, a relationship between chemical hardness and experimental HMF yields was found in the rate-limiting step of glucose-to-fructose isomerization for six metal chlorides; HMF production was promoted when the metal chloride and a substrate had a similar chemical hardness. To study the organic solvent effect, a multivariate model was developed based on the insights gained from the mechanistic study of fructose dehydration, to predict HMF yields in a given water-organic cosolvent system. It showed a reliable accuracy in evaluating HMF yields with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.0% with respect to experimental HMF yields for 13 solvents, and also predicted HMF yields with a MAE of 10.7% for four new solvents. Chemical interpretation of the model revealed that it is desirable to use a solvent capable of stabilizing the carbocation intermediates with low proton transfer activity and high hydrogen bond basicity, to maximize the HMF yield. This multivariate model informs experimentalists about rational selection of solvents with very low computational costs needed to calculate only six variables for each solvent. It can be expanded to other catalytic systems such as heterogeneous Bronsted-Lewis bifunctional catalysts and enables optimization of reaction conditions to obtain other useful platform molecules through biomass conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500029

The hypothesis here is that the metal ions in metal oxide clusters on a Co(0001) support enhance the adsorption of CO and weaken the C-O bond strength, which can then facilitate the dissociation of the CO reactant. To test this hypothesis, we developed three computational models of Ti4O8/Co(0001), Zr4O8/Co(0001), and (Mn8O8Co)-Co-/(0001). We quantify the CO adsorption behavior at the interface sites between an oxide cluster and a Co(0001) support as well as the corresponding IR spectra. We correlate the computed CO stretch frequencies with their CO adsorption energies, as well as the CO stretch frequency with the C-O bond length, and relate these findings to the changes in the chemical bonding in the bound CO. The interface is the most favorable site for CO adsorption. Adsorption results in an increase of the C-O bond length and a decrease in its vibrational frequency. From a chemical bonding analysis, the bond order in CO at this site drops from 3 (in the gas phase) to 1. This decrease in bond order is a necessary precursor stage for CO dissociation. The experimental measurements of the corresponding Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra support this point. The favorability of CO adsorption at the interface sites is due to an electron transfer from the metal ion in the metal oxide cluster to the O atom in CO. We establish a linear relationship between the C-O bond length and CO frequency, and this relationship is found to be independent of the support, type of metal oxide cluster, or the adsorption site.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500030		
J	Kopac, Drejc; Jurkovic, Damjan Lasic; Likozar, Blaz; Hus, Matej								First-Principles-Based Multiscale Modelling of Nonoxidative Butane Dehydrogenation on Cr2O3(0001)								ACS CATALYSIS				10	24			14732	14746		10.1021/acscatal.0c03197				DEC 18 2020	2020	Propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10) are short straight-chain alkane molecules that are difficult to convert catalytically. Analogous to propane, butane can be dehydrogenated to butenes (also known as butylenes) or butadiene, which are used industrially as raw materials when synthesizing various chemicals (plastics, rubbers, etc.). In this study, we present results of detailed first-principles-based multiscale modelling of butane dehydrogenation, consisting of three size- and time-scales. The reaction is modelled over Cr2O3(0001) chromium oxide, which is commonly used in the industrial setting. A complete 108-step reaction pathway of butane (C4H10) dehydrogenation was studied, yielding 1-butene (CH2CHCH2CH3) and 2-butene (CH3CHCHCH3), 1-butyne (CHCCH2CH3) and 2-butyne (CH3CCCH3), butadiene (CH2CHCHCH2), butenyne (CH2CHCCH), and ultimately butadiyne (CHCCCH). We include cracking and coking reactions (yielding C-1, C-2, and C-3 hydrocarbons) in the model to provide a thorough description of catalyst deactivation as a function of the temperature and time. Density functional theory calculations with the Hubbard U model were used to study the reaction on the atomistic scale, resulting in the complete energetics and first-principles kinetic parameters for the dehydrogenation reaction. They were cast in a kinetic model using mean-field microkinetics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The former was used to obtain gas equilibrium conditions in the steady-state regime, which were fed in the latter to provide accurate surface kinetics. A full reactor simulation was used to account for the macroscopic properties of the catalytic particles: their loading, specific surface area, and density and reactor parameters: size, design, and feed gas flow. With this approach, we obtained first-principles estimates of the catalytic conversion, selectivity to products, and time dependence of the catalyst activity, which can be paralleled to experimental data. We show that 2-butene is the most abundant product of dehydrogenation, with selectivity above 90% and turn-over frequency above 10(-3) s(-1) at T = 900 K. Butane conversion is below 5% at such low temperature, but rises above 40% at T > 1100 K. Activity starts to drop after similar to 6 h because of surface poisoning with carbon. We conclude that the dehydrogenation of butane is a viable alternative to conventional olefin production processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500031	33362945

This longstanding puzzle exposes gaps in the fundamental understanding of electrocatalysis by showing that singular adsorption descriptors (e.g., the hydrogen binding energy) cannot describe kinetic effects across electrolytes. In this Perspective, we discuss the strengths and shortcomings of binding energies as HER/HOR activity descriptors across different electrolytes and catalyst surfaces, with a special emphasis on the bifunctional mechanism, and identify several "beyond adsorption" descriptors for chemical dynamics in the double layer, including the potential of zero (free/total) charge, the binding energy of coadsorbed spectator species, transition state barrier heights, and the solvation strength of electrolyte cations. Recent evidence for and against the importance of these phenomena is assessed in the context of hydrogen electrocatalysis to determine their feasibility to accurately predict catalyst behavior. Finally, we propose paths forward for improving the mechanistic understanding of how specific interactions between the surface and species in solution affect macroscopic rates, which include combining single-crystal voltammetry, electroanalytical chemistry, in-operando spectroscopy, atomic-scale DFT calculations, and molecular "double-layer dopants".									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500032

Plasma activation can potentially circumvent the limitations of conventional thermocatalytic ammonia synthesis; however, the contribution of different reaction mechanisms to the production of ammonia at the catalyst surface remains unclear. Here, we identify the reaction intermediates adsorbed on gamma-Al2O3-supported Ni and Fe catalysts during plasma-activated ammonia synthesis under various temperatures and reactor configurations using FTIR spectroscopy, steady-state flow reactor experiments, and computational kinetic modeling. Ammonia yield can be influenced by plasma-derived intermediates and their interactions with catalyst surfaces, which lead to different reaction pathways: Ni/gamma-Al2O3 enhances plasma-promoted NH3 production and favors surface-adsorbed NHx species, while Fe/gamma-Al2O3 shows the presence of N2Hy and a lower overall concentration of N-containing adsorbates. Plasma-catalyst interactions are probed to reveal that elevated temperature and plasma irradiation of the surfaces promote NH3 desorption. The direct evidence of catalytic surface reactions occurring during a plasma-activated process provides mechanistic insight into plasma-activated ammonia synthesis.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500033

The pK(a) of the amido ligand moiety in this catalytic system is highly sensitive to the species adsorbed on the metal center, resulting in a substantial variation in the ligand pK(a) along the catalytic cycle. Since the ligand pK(a) is an important characteristic that determines the exact role of the ligand during aqueous methanol dehydrogenation, it has important implications for metal-ligand cooperative pathways.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500034

In situ NMR at 50 degrees C is used to track the selective transformation of methane to CH3OSO3H and CH3SO3H at high conversions. Integrating a set of kinetic and computational studies, the mechanism of methane monofunctionalization by Pd-2(III) is examined. Experimental rate laws and common kinetic isotope effects for CH3OSO3H and CH3SO3H formation suggest that both transformations proceed via a common rate-limiting C-H activation step. Introduction of O-2 or Pd-2(II,III) suppresses CH3SO3H generation, indicating a radical chain sequence. Although the metal-metal bonded Pd-2(III) complex is a net two-electron oxidant, our aggregate kinetic data point to a mechanistic model that features rate-limiting H atom abstraction by the Pd-2(III) complex to generate a methyl radical intermediate. The CH3 center dot intermediate then recombines with Pd-2(II,III) to furnish a CH3Pd2III intermediate that reductively eliminates CH3OSO3H. Alternatively, the CH3 center dot intermediate can enter a chain reaction with SO3 to generate CH3SO3H. DFT computations support the radical-based C-H activation by Pd-2(III) and delineate H atom abstraction pathways with computed reaction barriers and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) that are consistent with experimental data. These mechanistic investigations challenge the paradigm of electrophilic C-H activation and highlight H atom abstraction as a potent pathway for selective methane C-H oxidative functionalization at high reaction rates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500035

In this work, a lead-halide perovskite ( MAPbBr(3), MA = methylammonium) is utilized as a photocatalyst for selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) using atmospheric O-2 upon visible-light irradiation. Under minimally optimized conditions, the photocatalytic conversion of HMF in acetonitrile solvent reaches 100% with a DFF selectivity of over 90%, achieving an overall furanic carbon yield of over 96%. A detailed catalytic mechanism was proposed based on various spectroscopic and experimental results, revealing that the atmospheric O-2, photogenerated electrons (e(-)), holes (h(+)), O-center dot(2)-, and O-1(2) species together play crucial roles in the effective and selective photo-oxidation of HMF to DFF. In addition, our present photocatalytic system is also applicable for photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol with approximately 100% conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity, providing insights for future exploration of the present catalytic system.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500036

However, understanding the interplay between the molecular processes and the local catalyst properties at the scale of individual particles requires the correlation of information obtained from different microscopy techniques. In this contribution, we directly reveal the nontrivial nanoscale correlation between the acid site distribution and the local catalytic performance of dealuminated mordenite zeolite particles by sequentially applying advanced Raman microspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. In addition to the intra- and interparticle heterogeneities, the nonstraightforward correlation between acidity and activity at the pixel-to-pixel level highlights the complex impact of postsynthetic treatments on zeolites.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500037

The activity of 1 and product yields outperform the currently available non-transition-metal catalysts used for this catalysis. Mechanistic studies show that the silicon(II) center in complex 1 catalyzes the C-N bond formation via a different pathway in comparison with non-transition-metal catalysts.

We use this Au+TiO2 series to correlate mechanisms that influence catalytic activity including hot electron injection and production, electron-hole pair formation, oxygen vacancy content, and electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) stemming from photoinduced charge transfer from TiO2 to Au. The Au weight loading varies from 1 and 8 wt %, and Au NPs are either entrained within the oxide network of the aerogel during sol-gel synthesis (Au-IN-TiO2) or deposited on as-formed TiO2 aerogel (Au-ON/TiO2). Electron tomography reveals that Au-IN-TiO2 exhibits greater metal parallel to metal-oxide intimacy than Au-ON/TiO2 at the same weight loading, while increasing Au content (especially with Au-ON/TiO2) yields broader size distributions, larger Au NPs, and lower Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy. Comparing broadband photoactivity to dark activity reveals that high Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy and monodisperse small (similar to 5 nm) Au NPs diminishes catalytic activity under broadband illumination, while Au+TiO2 composites with high weight loading, some large (>50 nm) Au NPs, and decreased Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy enhance activity under broadband illumination.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500040

However, the use of enzymes in OSs often results in enzyme deactivation or a dramatic drop in catalytic activity. Herein, we have developed a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between enzymes and OSs based on numerous observables obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of 32 variants of Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA). We have tested the wild-type enzymes and variants carrying single and multiple substitutions toward the organic cosolvent 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE, 12% (v/v)). After analyzing the distribution of 35 structural and dynamic observables, we uncovered that increased enzyme surface hydration of substituted sites is the predominant factor to drive the improved resistance in OS. The iterative recombination of four surface substitutions revealed that the extent of hydration in BSLA variants correlates strongly with its OS resistance (R-2 = 0.91). Remarkably, the substitutions recombination led to a highly resistant BSLA variant (I12R/M137H/N166E) with a 7.8-fold improved resistance in 12% (v/v) TFE, while retaining comparable catalytic activity (similar to 92%) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Our findings prove that strengthening protein surface hydration via surface charge engineering is an effective and efficient rational strategy for tailoring enzyme stability in OSs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500041

Nevertheless, manganese oxides suffer from low reusability while carbon materials face the problem of limited catalytic efficiency. For the purpose of making full use of the advantages of the two materials as well as avoiding their shortcomings, carbon-coated Mn3O4 composites (Mn3O4/C) with a regular nanocube structure were designed to activate PS for the removal of organics, and the catalytic processes were deeply investigated. The catalyst prepared at 400 degrees C with a precursor ratio (glucose/KMnO4) of 0.5 exhibited the best catalytic performance along with satisfactory reusability owing to the protection of the outer carbon layer. According to experimental results and density functional theory calculation, there were van der Waals interaction and a part of the strong attraction between the interface of PS and Mn3O4/C, which could be enhanced by inner Mn3O4 and thus promoted the electron transfer between PS and carbon shell, and the defective edges of the carbon layer with hydroxyl (C-OH) groups could act as active sites for PS activation. Radical (SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot) and nonradical (O-1(2)) oxidation processes both participated in the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol, in which (OH)-O-center dot was dominating. This study not only proposed a promising catalyst for the degradation of pollutants but also expanded research ideas for future PS activation mechanism studies by integrating the experiment and simulation.									11	0	0	0	6	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500042

In-situ spectroscopy is employed to determine the trend of interfacial CO2 concentration with different alkali metal cations. Contradictory to the cation buffering hypothesis, the interfacial CO2 concentration decreases with increasing size of alkali metal cations at CO2RR conditions on Au. The interfacial CO2 concentration is largely dependent on the rate of CO2 depletion by reduction or reaction with OH- generated at the electrode, and not on the proposed buffering effect.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500043

Here, we evaluate the ceria catalyst for CO oxidation as a model reaction to rationally design an ultrastable catalyst with high activity. The goal was achieved by co-doping with rare-earth (RE) and transition metals (TM) simultaneously. The RE dopant stabilized the catalyst by inhibiting sintering that could lead to catalyst deactivation. The TM dopant increased the activity by facilitating formation of surface defects. Consequently, ceria co-doped with RE (=La, Sm) and TM (=Cu) had increased catalytic activity as well as superior resistance to deactivation during 10 cycle measurement (1 cycle: 900 degrees C, 24 h -> cooling at room temperature -> target degrees C, 24 h) of similar to 700 h, which is harsher than any other reported conditions. This approach will shed light on the design of ultrastable oxide materials for a wide range of catalytic reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500044

Using a microkinetic analysis in combination with results from density functional theory calculations, we show that although propane dehydrogenation (PDH) occurs by two successive dehydrogenation steps on terraces, an unexpected non-reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism accounts for more than half the propylene production at the under-coordinated active sites that dominate the kinetics of PDH. The main reaction is composed of three dehydrogenation steps that have two beta-H atoms and one alpha-H atom removed from propane, followed by the hydrogenation of CH3CCH2; starting from this species, the formation of propylene and byproducts proceed by way of two parallel competing reactions. The proposed mechanism has been verified by exploring several key and general aspects of the kinetic behavior observed in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and it is found that only when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are taken into consideration can the experimentally determined kinetics be properly reproduced. Increasing the H-2 partial pressure from low values favors an increase in the coverage of free sites due to the gasification of adsorbed coke precursors, which in turn gives rise to lowered energy barriers for C-H bond breaking, thereby achieving an increased propane consumption rate. As the H-2/C3H8 ratio increases, the rate of propylene production first goes up and then declines, and a maximum is observed at a H-2/C3H8 ratio of 1.33, which occurs when the negative effect of the increased free 4-fold hollow sites that bring about deep dehydrogenation begins to dominate the positive effect of the increased free step sites that are responsible for activating propane. The mechanism formulated here proves to be valid even if the temperature, pressure, or the H-2/C3H8 ratio is varied and hence provides a foundation for the rational design of metal and alloy catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500045

Herein, the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) is systematically studied on the NiCu alloy-loaded carbon nitride nanosheets (NixCuy/CNS). The TOF of AB hydrolysis for NiCu/CNS catalyst under visible light irradiation was nearly 3.5 times higher than that in the dark. Photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that the improved photocatalytic activities originate from a combination of alloying effect, Mott-Schottky junction at the metal-semiconductor interface as well as the localized surface plasmon resonance induced under the visible light irradiation, which synergistically increase the local electron density at the active Ni sites. More importantly, the infrared spectra and isotope labeling-mass spectrometry methods were used to establish the source of hydrogen and unravel the reaction mechanism. It is suggested that the cleavages of B-H and O-H bonds are the initial steps of AB hydrolysis, which lead to the formation of intermediates M-H- (metal and electronegative H- from -BH3) and M-H+ (metal and electropositive H+ from H2O), respectively. The H-2 molecule could form through three main paths as (1) two H atoms from -BH3, (2) two H atoms from H2O, and (3) one H atom from -BH3 and another from H2O. Results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations are consistent with the formation of electron-rich Ni sites in the NiCu, and the activation of H2O is a rate-limiting step (RLS). Redistribution of electrons in NiCu significantly enhances the adsorption of AB, the activation of H2O molecules, and the associative desorption of H adatoms as well, which effectively promote the cleavage of B-H and O-H bonds and release of H-2. This work gives a systematic mechanistic study on photocatalytic AB hydrolysis involving multichannel electron-transfer pathways, which will provide a powerful guidance for the rational design of active catalysts for AB hydrolysis through multipronged effects.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500046

Here, Co nanoparticles were utilized for the electrochemical activation of CO2 hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure conditions. A range of transient kinetic experiments in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and imaging techniques were employed to correlate the observed catalytic activity with the electronic and morphological characteristics of the cobalt catalyst surface. Our results show that migrating ions from the solid electrolyte to the catalyst surface has a dual effect, which has an impact on the observed catalytic behavior. First, they lead to an electrochemically formed double layer on the catalyst surface, which effectively modifies the catalyst work function and consequently alters the observed catalytic rate. Second, they have a profound effect on the oxidation state of cobalt and therefore on the structure of the cobalt oxide particles formed. The presence of Co oxide phases upon anodic polarization shows up to a 5-fold increase in the catalytic rate of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The enhancement of the catalytic activity observed in this work, with a relatively inexpensive cobalt oxide film, is comparable to that obtained with noble metal catalysts in classical EPOC studies. The present study also demonstrates that the formation of different oxide phases can be controlled accurately by electrochemical means and used to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity of cobalt. The reported results could guide the design and operation of more selective and active catalytic processes for the RWGS reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500047

However, most electrocatalysts are confronted with the predicament of a low yield rate for ammonia production. In this study, we report the chlorine-doped reduced graphene oxide that can efficiently electroreduce nitrogen to ammonia. At an applied potential of -0.3 V (vs RHE), the chlorine-doped reduced graphene oxide attains a high NH3 yield of 70.9 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) (2.84 mu g h(-1) cm(-2)) with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 5.97%, which shows a considerable ammonia yield in terms of the metal-free carbonaceous material electrocatalysts. Experimental results indicate that the chlorine doping can be propitious to remarkably strengthen the nitrogen adsorption in the defect structure. Density functional theory calculations verify this result and further reveal that the adsorbed nitrogen is reduced through the associative distal pathway. These results come down to the appropriate electronegativity of chlorine, which can induce the electron redistribution of the adjacent carbon atoms, favoring the electroreduction of N-2. Our work expands a new member for the application of nonmetallic carbonaceous materials in nitrogen electroreduction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500048

Reconstruction of the enzymatic active sites in the artificial systems, to produce active and robust biocatalysts, has been a significant but challenging subject. Biomolecular self-assembly, typically with de novo designed peptide or DNA as the building blocks, provides an effective avenue to orient and confine reactive groups into a catalytically active configuration to mimic and even rival the catalytic performance of native enzymes. In this Review, we discuss the chemical and structural properties of DNA and peptide selfassemblies, and principles and strategies of designing active sites that show hydrolase-, peroxidase-, oxidase-, or aldolase-like activities. We focus on the relationship between and control over the structures of the artificial active sites and catalytic performances. We also highlight the synergies between the components in the formation of the active sites, as well as the applications of the artificial enzymes. In the end, we provide an outlook on the obstacles, possible solutions, and future directions, in the aspect of structural modeling, improving catalytic performances, and upgrading complexity of the active sites.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500050

In contrast to traditional zirconia-based heterogeneous catalysts, the community has assumed that Zr-MOFs are inert catalyst supports that do not participate directly in hydrocarbon transformations, such as olefin hydrogenation and isomerization. Here, we report that the Zr-MOF NU-1000 is capable of catalyzing olefin hydrogenation and isomerization, without any postsynthetic modifications, under a hydrogen atmosphere. We probe H-2 activation over the nodes of NU-1000 via spectroscopic and computational techniques revealing that H-2 dissociation can occur heterolytically across coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites and proximal hydroxide and mu(3)-oxo ligands. These results, along with catalytic experiments, suggest that H-2 activation results in node-supported zirconium hydrides capable of the hydrogenation and isomerization of 1-butene. When examining rate dependence on the partial pressure of H-2, we observe first-order dependence for hydrogenation and half-order dependence for isomerization. Half-order H-2 rate dependence is consistent with a mechanism where both fragments of cleaved H-2 are active for 1-butene isomerization, suggesting that heterolytic cleavage generates acidic protons resulting in parallel, acid-, and hydride-catalyzed isomerization pathways. This work shows that Zr-MOFs have more diverse reactivity than the current literature may suggest and opens possibilities for ways in which Zr-MOFs can be used as heterogeneous catalysts and supports.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500051

Use in the Catalytic Desymmetrization of 3,3-Disubstituted Oxetanes								ACS CATALYSIS				10	24			14971	14983		10.1021/acscatal.0c04497				DEC 18 2020	2020	A family of C-2-symmetrical 1,1'-spirobiindane-7,7'-diol (SPINOL) derivatives containing polymerizable styryl units has been prepared through a highly convergent approach. Radical copolymerization of these monomers with styrene has allowed the synthesis of a family of immobilized SPINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acids (SPAs) where the combination of the restricted axial flexibility of the SPINOL units and the existence of extended and adaptable chiral walls adjacent to them leads to enhanced stereocontrol in catalytic processes. The optimal immobilized species (Cat f) brings about the catalytic desymmetrization of 3,3-disubstituted oxetanes in up to 90% yield with up to >99% enantioselectivity, exhibiting a very high recyclability (no decrease in conversion or enantioselectivity after 16, 16-h runs). To exploit these characteristics, a continuous flow process has been implemented and operated for the sequential preparation of 17 diverse enantioenriched products. The suitability of the flow setup for gram scale preparations (20 mmol scale), the stability of Cat f for long periods of time with intermittent use in flow, and its deactivation/reactivation by treatment with pyridine/hydrochloric acid in dioxane have been demonstrated. Density functional theory has been employed to provide a rational justification of the deep effect on enantioselectivity arising from the presence of sterically bulky substituents at the 6,6'-positions of the SPINOL unit. The main structural features of Cat f have subsequently been incorporated to the design of a simplified homogeneous analog available in a straightforward manner (Cat g) that performs the benchmark desymmetrization reaction with similar yields and enantioselectivities as Cat f, providing a convenient alternative for cases when single use in solution is sought.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500052

Catalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals has been put forward as a viable strategy. While thermocatalytic routes of producing CO, methanol, methane, and higher hydrocarbons from CO2 have been the focus of considerable research efforts, photocatalytic conversion is an emerging approach. Photoactivation of CO2 has potential as a greener process because it could be carried out at lower temperatures and pressures, decreasing the energy consumption. The recent advent of available computational power and tools has made it possible to study the reaction in silico for catalyst prediction and mechanism elucidation. In this Review, we thus focus on ab initio research of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and comparison with experiments. The most commonly used materials are variously doped TiO2, g-C3N4, and perovskites, which have favorable optical properties on their own. Their efficiency is mostly governed by the band gap, charge separation, and charge transfer. Their characteristics can be improved, and the catalysts can be tailored for a specific use by doping, introduction of defects (such as oxygen vacancies or geometric effects), cocatalysts, or using Z-scheme catalysts. Most theoretical studies focus on the calculations of conduction and valence bands, band gap, and adsorption energies. Some studies try to describe the reaction mechanism. Few studies go beyond the hybrid-functional DFT approach and try to explicitly model the effect of electron excitation. While a theoretical description of the excited states is possible with post-DFT methods, it has yet to be applied to the problem of CO2 photoreduction on a larger scale. We conclude the Review with an outlook on how the current state-of-the-art can be used for improving the existing catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500053

Broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance were observed under the reaction conditions. Computational studies suggest that ligands containing phenyl substituents provide greater activity through more favorable aniline binding in the catalytic cycle in comparison to alkyl-substituted phosphorinanes. A general and high-yielding procedure for the synthesis of biaryl phosphorinanes by phospha-Michael addition of primary biarylphosphines to 1,4-dien-3-ones in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), under relatively mild conditions (23-110 degrees C), is also described. HFIP as the solvent significantly accelerates the phospha-Michael addition, allowing the preparation of previously inaccessible ligands and higher yields overall.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500054

Despite its application in asymmetric reduction, which prompted several engineering attempts of this enzyme, the order of chemical events in the active site, their contributions to limit the reaction rate, and interactions between the enzyme and non-native 3-oxocarboxylates have not been explored. Here, a combination of kinetic isotope effects, protein crystallography, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations were employed to dissect the HBDH mechanism. Initial velocity patterns and primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects establish a steady-state ordered kinetic mechanism for acetoacetate reduction by a psychrophilic and a mesophilic HBDH, where hydride transfer is not rate limiting. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on the reduction of 3-oxovalerate indicate that hydride transfer becomes more rate limiting with this non-native substrate. Solvent and multiple deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggest hydride and proton transfers occur in the same transition state. Crystal structures were solved for both enzymes complexed to NAD(+):acetoacetate and NAD+:3-oxovalerate, illustrating the structural basis for the stereochemistry of the 3-hydroxycarboxylate products. QM/MM calculations using the crystal structures as a starting point predicted a higher activation energy for 3-oxovalerate reduction catalyzed by the mesophilic HBDH, in agreement with the higher reaction rate observed experimentally for the psychrophilic orthologue. Both transition states show concerted, albeit not synchronous, proton and hydride transfers to 3-oxovalerate. Setting the MM partial charges to zero results in identical reaction activation energies with both orthologues, suggesting the difference in activation energy between the reactions catalyzed by cold- and warm-adapted HBDHs arises from differential electrostatic stabilization of the transition state. Mutagenesis and phylogenetic analysis reveal the catalytic importance of His150 and Asn145 in the respective orthologues.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500055	33391858

Bioinspired complexes that form high-valent metal-oxo intermediates capable of hydrogen abstraction and rebound hydroxylation are promising candidates. This promise has made them a target for computational high-throughput screening, typically simplified through the use of linear free energy relationships (LFERs). However, their mid-row transition-metal centers have numerous accessible spin and oxidation states that increase the combinatorial scale of design efforts. Here, we carry out a computational design screen of over 2500 mid-row 3d transition-metal complexes with four metals in numerous spin and oxidation states. We demonstrate the importance of spin/oxidation state in dictating design principles, limiting the generalization of strategies derived for widely studied high-spin Fe(II) catalysts to other metals or spin/oxidation states. Combined assessment of the effect of ligand-field tuning on reaction step energetics and on the identity of the ground state allows us to propose refined design strategies for spin-allowed methane-to-methanol catalysis. We observe weak coupling of energetics and design principles between reaction steps (e.g., oxo formation vs methanol release), meaning that LFERs do not generalize across our larger catalyst set. To rationalize relative reactivity in known catalysts, we instead compute independent reaction energies and propose strategies for further improvements in catalyst design.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500056

Specifically, in the presence of C2H2/C2H4/H-2 reaction mixtures, a permeable amorphous hydrocarbon overlayer is formed with simultaneous insertion of carbon atoms into the Pd lattice that drives the formation of low-coordinated Pd-carbide, thus providing more reactive Pd-C-sub@C-layer sites (C-sub: subsurface carbon; C-layer: carbon layer on the surface). The combination of these surface and subsurface effects hinders Pd-hydride, weakens ethylene adsorption confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, and thus improves catalytic behavior for selective hydrogenation of acetylene (93% ethylene selectivity at 100% conversion) with long-term stability. In the absence of hydrogen, a denser more crystalline overlayer is formed with severely restricted permeability, resulting in significantly lower activity. Moreover, by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), it is demonstrated that different active sites dominate this catalytic reaction depending on the choice of adsorbate and exposure temperature. This work represents an alternative and arguably a simpler manner to design more reactive catalytic sites with the characteristics of long-term stability and facile preparation, which would enable promising industrial applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500057

Here, a 5-methylidene-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-one- dependent aminomutase from Taxus canadensis (TcPAM) was repurposed to transfer the amino group irreversibly from ( 2S)-styryl-alpha-alanine to exogenously supplied trans-3-phenylglycidate enantiomers, producing anti-phenylserines stereoselectively. TcPAM catalysis inverted the intrinsic regioselective chemistry from amination at C-beta to C-alpha of enantioenriched trans-3-phenylglycidates to make phenylserine predominantly (97%) over phenylisoserine (similar to 3% relative abundance). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the chiral auxiliary derivatives of the biocatalyzed products confirmed that the amine transfer was stereoselective for each glycidate enantiomer. TcPAM converted (2S,3R)-3-phenylglycidate to (2S)-anti-phenylserine predominantly (89%) and (2R,3S)-3-phenylglycidate to (2R)-anti-phenylserine (88%) over their antipodes, with inversion of the configuration at C-alpha in each case. Both glycidate enantiomers formed a small amount (similar to 10%) of syn-phenylserine by retaining the configuration at C-alpha. The minor syn-isomer likely came from a beta-hydroxy oxiranone intermediate formed by intramolecular ring opening of the oxirane ring by the carboxylate before amine transfer. TcPAM had a slight preference toward (2S,3R)-3-phenylglycidate, which was turned over (k(cat) = 0.3 min(-1)) 1.5 times faster than the (2R,3S)-glycidate (k(cat) = 0.2 min(-1)). The catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)(app)/K-M(app) approximate to 20 M(-1)s(-1)) of TcPAM for the antipodes were similar. The kinetic data supported a two-substrate ping-pong mechanism for the amination of the phenylglycidates, with competitive inhibition at higher glycidate substrate concentrations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500060

Combining nonprecious cocatalysts with semiconductors is vital for optimizing these processes. Herein, a step-by-step route is reported for the in situ growth of island-shaped graphene on TaON particles (TaON@G) with controllable distribution, targeting a superior photocatalyst for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction. The TaON@G photocatalyst possesses the snug contact interface with suitable interfacial energy levels for accelerating the charge separation, the island-shaped graphene with a hollow nanoarchitecture for facilitating the adsorption of CO2, and the hierarchical structure with spatially separated active sites for activating CO2 and promoting proton release. The optimized TaON@G achieves a visible-light-driven CO2-to-CH4 yield of 1.61 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is nearly 13-fold higher compared with that of pristine TaON and outperforms most Ta-based (oxy)nitride catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further elucidate the enhanced activity, suggesting that TaON interacts with graphene strongly with the charge transfer from TaON to graphene, inducing electron-rich graphene with a significant upshift of the graphene Fermi level, leading to a high filling fraction of the antibonding orbitals, thereby weakening the C=O bond of the adsorbed CO2 for breaking. Our study highlights the importance of rational design of well-defined hierarchical photocatalysis to synergistically integrate the structural and functional advantages for maximizing catalytic performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500061

Iron complexes of thio-imino-quinoline (TIQ) ligands, upon activation by modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), were found to catalyze the oligomerization of alpha,omega-dienes (1,7-octadiene, 1,8-nonadiene, and 1,9-decadiene) and the copolymerization of such dienes with ethylene. The reactions furnish highly linear structures with internal double bonds, indicating the incorporation of both vinyl groups of alpha,omega-dienes into the polymer chain in a linear insertion fashion. Iron complexes with large substituents (e.g., iPr, Cy) on the S atom and small substituents (e.g., Et, Me) at the ortho positions of the N-aryl ring in the TIQ ligand afforded superior catalytic activity, high linear selectivity, and high alpha alpha,omega-diene content in the ethylene-alpha,omega-diene copolymers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the diene enchainment involves 2,1-insertion of the first vinyl group into a Fe-C bond and beta-H elimination, followed by 1,2-insertion of the second vinyl group into a Fe-H bond. The linear enchainment can be attributed to the low activation barriers for the beta-H elimination and subsequent 1,2-insertion. The formation of internal double bonds in the ethylene-alpha,omega-diene copolymer chain allows for facile postpolymerization functionalization, which was demonstrated by olefin hydrosilylation to access Si-functionalized materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500062

Such developments often require catalysts with particular morphologies because many chemical reactions are sensitive to the catalyst structure. However, it can be challenging to synthesize and stabilize shape-controlled catalysts. It would therefore be desirable to tailor the morphology of an existing electrocatalyst to exhibit favorable catalytic properties. In this work, such morphological alteration is explored using cathodic corrosion: an electrochemical etching process that can generate geometrical shapes on metallic surfaces. Specifically, cathodic corrosion is utilized to tailor a well-defined Pt(111) electrode for oxygen reduction and glycerol oxidation catalysis. Both the oxygen reduction activity and the glycerol oxidation selectivity can be tailored by controlling the cathodic corrosion conditions. These results demonstrate the specific potential of cathodic corrosion for tailoring catalyst activity and selectivity.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500063

Nickel sulfides offer significant potential as electrocatalysts for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, the active phase governing the electrochemical conversion is still under debate. We show that mesoporous thin-film NiS2 synthesized by a novel soft-templating method without post-sulfurization exhibits superior HER activity in alkaline media after a preconditioning step that results in sulfur leaching, amorphization of the surface, and collapse of the mesoporous structure. A comparative analysis with crystalline NiS2 reveals that partial hydroxylation of the under-coordinated Ni sites is responsible for the superior HER activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500064

We hope to show that Reetz did not consider these research areas to be totally unrelated realms, and attempt to reveal his transdisciplinary way of thinking about methodology development. Since biocatalysis has become crucial for chemical synthesis, we mainly focus on Reetz's contributions in this area. Some personal reflections from some of his former co-workers are also included, which reveal the stimulating atmosphere in the Reetz group in terms of science, career advice, and the importance of ethical considerations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500065

Here, we report that the Li additive restructures MgO to enhance the surface density of the fourfold-coordinated Mg2+ site (Mg-4c(2+)) of MgO{110} facets, eventually leading to Li-MgO catalysts exclusively exposing the Mg-4c(2+) site. Such Li-MgO catalysts were observed to efficiently catalyze the OCM reaction by activating methane into a methyl radical intermediate with minimized further dissociations and consequent combustion reactions. These results demonstrate the presence of efficient single-site catalysis involving Mg-4c(2+) of MgO{110} facets in Li-MgO catalysts with high Li contents for the OCM reaction, which might provide some insights in developing industrially viable OCM catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500067

Silicotungstic acid (SiW) is found to be the most active and selective among other HPA. At low SiW loadings, catalysts have low selectivity due to the formation of a butanal by-product, while at high loadings (>= 40 wt %), selective butadiene formation and stable performance are achieved. Strong Bronsted acid sites associated with intrinsic SiW protons are shown to be more active in butadiene synthesis as compared with Si-OH2+ sites formed by the interaction of HPA protons with a silica support. The kinetic study and product cofeeding experiments suggest that propene activation or C-C bond formation is the rate-determining step and that both butadiene and butanal are formed over strong acid sites starting from a common intermediate. Over weaker acid sites, condensation of butanal with formaldehyde leads to 2-ethylacrolein. Besides that, the reaction is complicated by butadiene interaction with formaldehyde leading to 2,3-dihydropyran, propene oligomerization and cracking, formaldehyde decomposition toward CO and H-2, and extensive coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation. However, the optimization of reaction temperature, SiW loadings, and the content of water in reaction media allows us to achieve a butadiene selectivity up to 64% and stable catalyst performance with time on stream.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500068

Computational and Experimental Mechanistic Insights into the Ethanol-to-Butanol Upgrading Reaction over MgO								ACS CATALYSIS				10	24			15162	15177		10.1021/acscatal.0c04616				DEC 18 2020	2020	The mechanism of ethanol upgrading to higher products is still under debate, especially regarding intermediate species and hydrogenation and dehydrogenation steps. In this work, we conducted a combined theoretical and experimental approach to contribute to this discussion. For such, detailed electronic structure density functional theory calculations (aiming at probing density of states, infrared spectra, geometric parameters, charge densities, and reaction energetics) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy experiments were carried out revealing the relevance of an appropriate combination of reactive surface sites to support the formation of several intermediates that are formed in the C-C coupling over MgO. The roles of Mg and O sites were also studied under an electronic perspective and different geometrical arrangements. We found that a kink configuration was the most adequate for ethanol to 1-butanol upgrading. Our calculations also gave us arguments to propose distinct reaction routes, whose mutual predominance would depend upon reaction temperature. At temperatures up to 573 K, the so-called beta-route, which goes through scission of a C-beta-H bond and formation of an oxametallacycle-like intermediate, would dominate the coupling, whereas at higher temperatures, up to 673 K, a more usual Guerbet mechanism, via an aldol coupling step and then consecutive hydrogenations, would be expected. The theoretical conclusions were followed by a careful experimental strategy using sequential experimental planning techniques in order to estimate accurate parameters with the lowest possible experimental load. Information from these different sources was coupled to develop a mathematical model for the rate of the ethanol upgrading reaction, using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson approach. The developed and statistically validated model adequately described the experimental data at 673 K and 1.1 bar total pressure for ethanol partial pressures in the range from 0 to 20 kPa.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500069

Heterogeneous photocatalysts recently have gained growing attention to build such catalytic system for controllable reaction kinetics and enhanced activity. Incorporating a metal catalyst into the framework of the photocatalyst could endow unique metallaphotoredox platforms. Herein, we assemble carbon nitride and nickel (C3N4-Ni) via direct coordination of Ni2+ to C3N4 nitrogen, for visible-light-driven carbon-oxygen cross-coupling. By operating with an imidazole auxiliary ligand, C3N4-Ni efficiently catalyzed etherification of a variety of aryl bromides with alcohols or hydroxylation with water, exhibiting turnover numbers of >500. Ni maintained as isolated single site without aggregation after photoreaction and the recovered catalyst demonstrate sustained activity without additional Ni loading. Our work signifies the potential of uniting dual catalysis in well-designed sensitizer-metal architecture for complex organic transformations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500070

However, the formation of highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles is challenging because they are easily sintered. Here, we studied Cu nanoparticle formation by a simple deposition-reduction technique using Cu-doped MgAl2O4 (Mg1-xCuxAl2O4). Mg(1-)xCu(x)Al(2)O(4) possessed the following three types of Cu2+ species: short O-Cu octahedrally coordinated [CuO6](s), elongated O-Cu octahedrally coordinated [CuO6](el), and tetrahedrally coordinated [CuO4](t). The former two are found in the inverse-spinel-type Mg1-xCuxAl2O4, while the other is found in the normal-spinel-type Mg1-xCuxAl2O4. Additionally, by focusing on the difference in the reducibility of the Cu2+ species, we clarified that their fraction is related to Cu loading. For low Cu loading (x < 0.3), Mg1-xCuxAl2O4 mainly contained the [CuO6](s) species. On the other hand, for high Cu loading (x = 0.3), the fraction of the [CuO6](el) and [CuO4](t) species increased. Notably, among the prepared catalysts, H-2-reduced Mg0.8Cu0.2Al2O4 (x = 0.2) had the largest number of exposed metallic Cu sites, resulting in its good catalytic performance. Hence, the H-2 reduction of [CuO6](s) is essential for forming metallic Cu nanoparticles on metal oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500071

Its conversion to valuable products is extremely attractive but especially challenging without additional hydrogen sources. Herein we report a hydrogen-free production of 4-alkylphenols directly from native lignin via self-reforming-driven depolymerization and hydrogenolysis over Pt/NiAl2O4. This is the first example of acquiring 4-alkylphenols from native lignin. Using this strategy, high yields of 4-alkylphenols, 17.3 wt %, were obtained from birch lignin. Reaction pathway and mechanism studies revealed that this strategy initiates from the reforming of aliphatic hydroxys, followed by the cleavage of C-O linkages, and ends via demethoxylation over Pt/NiAl2O4. Moreover, the subsequent aqueous phase reforming of the as-formed methanol accelerates the whole process. This strategy realizes the one-pot production of 4-alkylphenols from lignin by fully utilizing the structural hydrogen in lignin and H2O, providing a low-cost and safe method of lignin valorization.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500074

Herein, a new class of ternary (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic is developed with excellent performance toward alkaline HOR. Specifically, the Pd-substitution facilitates the formation of L1(2)-Pt3Fe intermetallic at a lower annealing temperature. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations indicate that the in-situ formed interstitial alloying PdHx during the electrochemical cycle widens the d-band structure of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe and shifts downward the d-band center toward the Fermi level. The optimized ligand effect from PdHx gives rise to the encouraging activity for alkaline HOR. Meanwhile, a stepby-step monitoring technique and ex situ CO-stripping voltammetry jointly demonstrate that ordered atoms' arrangement of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic contributes to stabilize the local coordination environment and enables the maintenance of the ligand effect from the in situ formed Fe/Fe(OH)(x) heterostructure. Negligible decay in electrochemical surface areas of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic after a given accelerated durability test confirms the significant advantage in stability over Pt3Fe alloy. This work sheds light on the significance of ligand effects optimization and real-time tracing of the catalytic process to the structure-activity relationship establishment and subsequent catalyst designs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500075

However, it remains a great challenge to design a competitive HDO catalyst for selectively converting glycerol into 1,3-PDO owing to the higher thermodynamic stability of 1,2-PDO. In this work, theoretical analysis and first principles calculations were adopted for the design and development of an efficient HDO catalyst. The designed Pt/W/beta catalyst has low Pt and W loadings, and exhibits high performance in the HDO reaction with glycerol conversion (84.2%), 1,3-PDO selectivity (46.1%), and total C-3 alcohol selectivity (>90%) under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, experimental structure-performance relationship of the HDO catalyst was found to be consistent with our first principles prediction, confirming the important role of the interfacial structure in the HDO reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500076

Control of aromatic distribution and enhancement of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) selectivity are still a big challenge. Decoupling the complex reaction network, the relative activity of aromatization and alkylation on ZSM-5 determines the aromatic distribution. Herein, the STA reaction was studied over Cr2O3/ZSM-5 to reveal the influence of the zeolite morphology parameters on aromatic distribution. Using the "substitution ratio of aromatic ring" SC9+/A to reflect the relative rate of alkylation to aromatization, the linear dependence of SC9+/A on the morphology parameter (1/b) of ZSM5 was revealed. The methodology for control of aromatic distribution by altering the crystal size of ZSM-5 along the b-axis is then proposed. By further enhancing the aromatization activity via ion exchange of Zn to ZSM-5, a bifunctional catalyst showing a high BTX space time yield of 2.47 mmol g(-1) h(-1) (on carbon base) with 49.1% BTX fraction is developed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500077

Heteroatom-doped and/or -derived Cu as oxide-derived Cu has been investigated in context of development of a stable catalyst with high selectivity, whereas the role of heteroatoms is not yet well understood. It is not known whether heteroatoms act as a moiety of the catalyst or simply induce reconstruction of the catalyst. This work is an investigation of the role of the heteroatom in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a Cu electrode modified with methanethiol monolayers (MT-Cu), which is able to distinguish the presence of heteroatom contamination originating from electrolyte or air. Controlled potential electrolysis of CO2 using an MT-Cu electrode at -1.8 V at Ag/AgCl exhibits greater selectivity for C-2 products than an unmodified polycrystalline Cu electrode (bare Cu). On the other hand, a sulfur-modified Cu (S-Cu) electrode predominantly generates formate as a CO2 reduction product. In an investigation of the mechanism, an in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy instrument is used as a powerful surface analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy, grazing-incidence wideangle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) are also employed in the investigation. The spectroscopic data show that reconstruction and formation of Cu+ on the Cu surface occur at negative potential greater than -1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl by electrochemical reduction of methanethiol monolayers. DFT calculations are also performed under conditions close to the experimental conditions of electrical bias and aqueous electrolyte. The results indicate that a roughened surface is favorable for generating C-2 products. In addition, the Cu+ moiety promotes generation of C-2 products, demonstrating that the doped heteroatom plays a crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500078

Here, time- and temperature-dependent NMR spectroscopic studies reveal alkene complexes that were missed when lower substrate-tocatalyst ratios were used. To aid in rigorous comparison of the experiment with theory, but-1-ene and isomers were used as the simplest isomerizable alkenes, and both the fast reaction of but-1-ene to form (E)-but-2-ene and the very slow reaction of (Z)-but-2-ene were performed. Temperature-dependent rate constants were obtained from fits to the time-dependent concentration profiles. The resulting Arrhenius activation energies allow comparison to a computational model. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the butene isomerization mechanism considered several pathways. Binding of the butene to the catalyst in an exo-orientation is predicted to be the initial step of the preferred pathway for forming but-2-ene, with the E isomer favored over the Z by virtue of lower steric interactions while bound to the catalyst. Experimental observation of the butene-catalyst complex establishes that the rate-determining step precedes formation of the but-2ene-catalyst complex, and DFT calculations identify breaking of the Ru-N bond with formation of a weaker agostic interaction of an allylic C-H and torsion about the Ru-P bond in a key allylic intermediate as close competitors for the rate-determining step. Experimental values for selected thermodynamic parameters of the but-1-ene isomerization were also obtained.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500079

Although several homogeneous catalyst systems have been extensively developed for the hydrogenation of heteroarenes with high levels of chemo- and stereoselectivity, the development of mild conditions that allow for efficient and stereoselective hydrogenation of a broad range of substrates remains a challenge. This Perspective highlights recent advances in homogeneous catalysis of heteroarene hydrogenation as inspiration for the further development of asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts, and addresses underdeveloped areas and limitations of the current technology.									16	0	0	0	7	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200008	34567830

ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			13932	13945		10.1021/acscatal.0c03764				DEC 4 2020	2020	The structural and energetic features of phosphate and phosphonate hydrolysis in protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and water are studied using quantum mechanical (QM) cluster models. The calculations are able to reproduce observed kinetic isotope effects and capture several key trends in the experimental Brmnsted plots: the (beta)lg values are rather different for phosphate and phosphonate ester hydrolysis in solution but are similar in PP1. Detailed analyses of the structures, charge distributions, and bond orders of computed transition states support the general conclusion from experimental study that phosphoryl transfer transition states are different for the two classes of substrates in solution but similar in PP1. On the other hand, the microscopic models also highlight notable differences between the phosphate and phosphonate transition states, which are manifested in not only structure but also kinetic isotope effects. Overall, we find that while beta(lg)/beta(EQ,lg) generally correlates with the partial charge on leaving group oxygen and the fractional bond order of the breaking P-O-lg bond, the precise mapping between beta(lg)/beta(EQ,lg) and P-O-lg bond order in the transition state is difficult due largely to the crosstalk between breaking and forming P-O bonds. Therefore, in further support of previous analyses of the limitations of free energy relations, our results suggest that while the free energy relation is a valuable tool for probing the nature of the transition state, a quantitative mapping of beta(lg) and beta(lg)/beta(EQ,lg )values to structure or charge in the transition state should be conducted with great care.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200017	34567831

Previous catalytic measurements and molecular characterization of boron-based catalysts by B-11 solid-state NMR spectroscopy and other techniques suggest that oxidized/hydrolyzed boron clusters are the catalytically active sites for ODH. However, B-11 solid-state NMR spectroscopy often suffers from limited resolution because boron-11 is an I = 3/2 half-integer quadrupolar nucleus. Here, ultrahigh magnetic field (B-0 = 35.2 T) is used to enhance the resolution of B-11 solid-state NMR spectra and unambiguously determine the local structure and connectivity of boron species in h-BN nanotubes used as an ODH catalyst (spent h-BNNT), boron-substituted MCM-22 zeolite (B-MWW), and silica-supported boron oxide (B/SiO2) before and after use as an ODH catalyst. One-dimensional direct excitation B-11 NMR spectra recorded at B-0 = 35.2 T are near isotropic in nature, allowing for the easy identification of all boron species. Two-dimensional (2D) H-1-B-11 heteronuclear correlation NMR spectra aid in the identification of boron species with B-OH functionality. Most importantly, 2D B-11 dipolar double-quantum single-quantum homonuclear correlation NMR experiments were used to unambiguously probe boron-boron connectivity within all heterogeneous catalysts. These experiments are practically infeasible at lower, more conventional magnetic fields due to a lack of resolution and reduced NMR sensitivity. The detailed molecular structures determined for the amorphous oxidized/hydrolyzed boron layers on these heterogeneous catalysts will aid in the future development of next-generation ODH catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200009	34413990

However, the construction of medium-sized fluoro-functionalized heterocycles remains unexplored. Their synthesis represents a formidable challenge due to the unfavorable entropic and enthalpic factors that arise from medium-sized rings and the unexpected properties induced by fluorinated groups. Here, we describe an efficient method for the preparation of highly functionalized gem-difluoromethylene N-heterocyclic lactones with 9- to 11-membered rings in a sequential CN-bond-cleaving ring-expansion process using difluoro-oxindoles, various zwitterion precursors, and a Pd catalyst. This sequential CN-cleaving expansion process was extended to synthesize nonfluorinated, medium-sized heterocycles with an a-keto-lactone moiety using isatin derivatives. Additionally, monofluorinated and nonfluorinated oxindoles were transformed into the corresponding medium-sized heterocyclic lactones using this protocol. The key for this transformation is the cleavage of the unreactive amide CN bond, which is smartly activated by the incorporation of two neighboring electron-withdrawing groups assisted with the nucleophilic attack of a Pd- coordinated zwitterion. The site-selective functionalization of a series of heterocyclic products was demonstrated to show their synthetic utility. Mechanistic details of the sequential cleavage/expansion process were proposed based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200032

The challenge is especially difficult because the catalyst needs to distinguish the inversion of a single hydroxyl and the alpha or beta glycosidic bonds that join monosaccharide building blocks. Here, we report synthetic glycosidase prepared through molecular imprinting within a cross-linked micelle. The nanoparticle catalyst resembles natural enzymes in dimension, water solubility, and a hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface-core topology. Its boronic acid functionalized active site binds its targeted glycoside substrate and an acid cofactor simultaneously, with the acidic group in close proximity to the exocyclic glycosidic oxygen. The hydrophobically anchored acid cofactor is tunable in acidity and causes selective cleavage of the targeted glycoside in mildly acidic water. Selectivity for both the glycan and the alpha/beta glycosidic bond can be rationally designed through the molecular imprinting process.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200004	34123483

These catalysts were highly selective for their targeted substrates and could selectively hydrolyze less reactive acetals over more reactive ones even under basic conditions. Their catalytic activity and selectivity were tunable through rational post-modification of the active site.

Although the impact of the electrolyte alkalinity on the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO2RR and CORR, respectively) has been extensively investigated on Cu surfaces, systematic investigation of the pH dependence of the surface Cu speciation has been lacking. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the pH dependence of Cu surface speciation and CO adsorption configuration in weakly to strongly alkaline electrolytes using in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Oxygen-containing species, e.g., CuOx/(OH)(y), are absent in near-neutral electrolyte of KHCO3 (pH = 8.9), and their onset potential becomes more positive with increasing the alkalinity of electrolytes. Concurrently, adsorbed CO transitions from atop-bonded (COatop) to bridge-bonded configuration (CObridge) as the pH of the electrolyte increases. CO is proposed to adsorb in the atop configuration only on Cu sites without neighboring oxygen-containing species, while the appearance of the CObridge band correlates with the presence of the oxygen-containing species. Surface speciation on Cu microparticles (Cu MPs) and oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) are similar in all the electrolytes investigated, while the CO adsorption bands show subtle differences on these two surfaces, reflecting variations in the microenvironment of CO adsorbed in the same configuration. Selectivity for C2+ products in the CORR on Cu MPs increases with the electrolyte alkalinity at -0.4 V-RHE, which correlates with the presence of the oxygen-containing Cu species. However, the presence of the oxygen-containing Cu species alone is shown to be an unreliable predictor of the CORR performance on Cu MPs and OD-Cu, which could be attributed to the difference in the microenvironment of the surface Cu sites. Results reported in this work highlight that the assumption that the surface Cu speciation under reducing potentials is independent of the electrolyte pH must be treated with caution.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200001

Unstinting efforts of the synthetic community have helped to overcome the long-standing major challenge of regioselectivity by introducing the directing group concept. However, the full potential of the strategy cannot be realized unless the activated C-H bonds are stereochemically controlled. The enantioselective C-H bond functionalization could provide an imperative tool for a sustainable way of synthesizing chiral complex molecular scaffolds. Despite the intrinsic challenges in achieving stereocontrol, the synthetic community has developed different tools in order to achieve stereoselective C-H bond functionalization.

It is traditionally produced by acid hydrolysis/enzymolysis of chitin but suffers from possible individual allergenic risk, serious environmental pollution, and low production yield. A recent rising approach for glucosamine production is microbial fermentation using engineered microorganisms to manufacture N-acetylglucosamine, followed by acid hydrolysis of N-acetylglucosamine to glucosamine. However, this approach does not produce glucosamine in one-pot, and suffers from environmental issues caused by the acid hydrolysis process. To produce cost-competitive glucosamine with environmental sustainability, we demonstrated an artificial in vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystem comprised of five cascade enzymes for biomanufacturing glucosamine from maltodextrin and inorganic ammonia in one-pot. This nonshellfish-derived, phosphate-balanced, and coenzyme-free synthetic enzymatic biosystem was optimized in terms of pH value, enzyme composition, phosphate concentration, and ammonia concentration. The optimized enzyme cocktail converted 10 g/L maltodextrin to 7.9 g/L glucosamine with a conversion efficiency of 75.8% mol/mol glucose equivalent of maltodextrin. Moreover, a simple scaling-up for this nonfermentative biomanufacturing biosystem was performed to investigate its industrial potential, giving out 23.7 g/L glucosamine from 50 g/L maltodextrin. This in vitro enzymatic platform provides a biorefinery technology for the production of glucosamine featuring predictable security, environmental friendliness, and sustainability, thereby representing a highly promising alternative approach for glucosamine production on an industrial scale.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200005

They often operate through high substrate specificity for catalysis. How such specificity is achieved is unclear. Here, we dealt with this question by investigating all-alpha dimeric deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolases (dUTPases). Typically, these dUTPases hydrolyze either dUTP or deoxyuridine diphosphate (dUDP) substrates. However, the dUTPase enzyme DR2231 from Deinococcus radiodurans selectively hydrolyzes dUTP only, and not dUDP. By means of extended classical molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations, we show that DR2231 achieves this specificity for dUTP via second-shell basic residues that, together with the two catalytic magnesium ions, contribute to properly orienting the gamma-phosphate of dUTP in a prereactive state. This allows a nucleophilic water to be correctly placed and activated in order to perform substrate hydrolysis. We show that this enzymatic mechanism is not viable when dUDP is bound to DR2231. Importantly, in several other dUTPases capable of hydrolyzing either dUTP or dUDP, we detected that active site second-shell basic residues are more in number, anchoring the beta-phosphate of the nucleotide substrate too, in contrast to what is observed in DR2231. Thus, strategically located basic second-shell residues mediate precise reactant positioning at the catalytic site, determining substrate specificity in dUTPases and possibly in other structurally similar nucleotide-processing metalloenzymes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200007

Here, we explain from first-principles calculations the HER activity of an industrial material known for its superior physical properties and chemical inertness. We find that, compared to bulk termination, a major surface reconstruction takes place, leading to the off-stoichiometric B-rich surface termination that contains the active sites. The hydrogen adsorbate configurations are further investigated under various adsorbate coverages. Many competing configurations appear to be accessible in reaction conditions, and thus, a grand canonical ensemble is established to describe the catalytic system. A phase diagram of adsorbate coverages is constructed as a function of pH and the applied potential. A complex reaction network is presented based on the ensemble-averaged reaction rates, and the electrocatalytic activities are evaluated under different overpotentials. The major contributors to the activity are found to be a few metastable surface states with a distinct electronic structure that are only accessible at high adsorbate coverages in reaction conditions. In addition, while the activity of the dominant active site is nearly the same as that on the unreconstructed WB, the B-rich formations play an important role of isolating the active sites and preventing the passivation of the surface with H-2 bubble formation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200010

Oxygen transfer from AgOx to Pd and the surface reactivity toward CO were investigated as a function of the Pd coverage using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results show that all of the oxygen from the AgO, layer (similar to 0.375 monolayer) migrates to the surface of Pd during formation of a nearly complete Pd bilayer at 300 K and that the oxygen coverages generated on Pd increase as the Pd cluster size decreases, reaching values that exceed the oxygen concentration in the AgOx layer by as much as a factor of 2. Experimental measurements and DFT calculations show that preferential binding of oxygen on the edges of the Pd clusters enhances the oxygen coverage on Pd clusters of decreasing size and produces a heterogeneous spatial distribution of oxygen. CO adsorbs in high coverages at 100 K by binding on both the terraces and O-rich edges of the Pd clusters. During subsequent heating, oxidation of the adsorbed CO consumes nearly all of the oxygen that transferred from AgOx to the Pd domains; in contrast, the pure AgOx layer exhibits limited reactivity toward CO adsorbed at 100 K. These results demonstrate that differences in oxophilicity drive facile oxygen transfer from Ag to the edges of Pd nanoclusters and thereby give rise to an efficient pathway for CO oxidation on bimetallic PdAg surfaces. The cooperation between the Pd and Ag domains results in near-interfacial chemistry that may be broadly important in catalysis by bimetallic alloys.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200011

There have been detailed investigations on the selective production of DHA and GA through the platinum-catalyzed electrochemical oxidation of glycerol, which is a surplus byproduct from biodiesel. However, less attention has been paid to the electrochemical behavior of DHA and GA themselves. Her; we report the electrochemical reduction of DHA and GA at different pH on platinum and palladium electrodes. Palladium exhibits a superior activity toward both the dehydroxylation and hydrogenation of DHA and GA. Using online high-performance liquid chromatography, we show that both DHA and GA display a two-step reduction. In particular, DHA is reduced first to acetol and then sequentially to acetone, while GA is first reduced to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), followed by hydrogenation to 1,3-propanediol. The reduction of both molecules is accompanied by a poisoning of the catalyst surface. In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements suggest adsorbed carbon monoxide as the poisoning species, resulting from the dissociative adsorption of DHA and GA. Mechanistic reaction pathways for both DHA and GA reduction are proposed and discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200013

The structure of ionic liquid-type (IL) molecular modifiers was systematically varied regarding spacer, side chain, and anion to assess the influence on the NP synthesis and their catalytic properties. Well-dispersed Rh NPs with diameters in the range of 0.6-2.0 nm were formed on all SILP materials, whereby the actual size was dependent significantly on the IL structure. The resulting variations in catalytic activity for hydrogenation of the C=O moiety in furfuralacetone allowed control of the product selectivity to obtain either the saturated alcohol or the ketone in high yield. Experiments conducted under batch and continuous flow conditions demonstrated that Rh NPs immobilized on SILPs with suitable IL structures are more active and much more stable than Rh@SiO2 catalyst synthesized on unmodified silica.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200014	33343998

L-Glutamate is an ideal material for the production of L-ABA through gamma-decarboxylation; however, enzyme-mediated gamma-decarboxylation of L-glutamate has not yet been reported. Here, this goal was achieved through isomerization of L-glutamate to (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartate by glutamate mutase (GM) and beta-decarboxylation of 3-methylaspartate by L-aspartate-beta-decarboxylase (Asd). Although the activity of wild-type Asd toward 3-methylaspartate could not be detected, a mutant Asd exhibiting high activity was isolated on the basis of enzyme engineering. The conversion of L-glutamate to L-ABA achieved 98.9%, which provided a more cost-effective process for L-ABA industrial production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200015

The vanadium cluster structures are based on experimental NMR measurements. The first step is Lewis acid-base addition of NH3 to a vanadium site for the neutral and formation of an "NH4+" site on the protonated surface. Different proton transfer pathways, which depend on the initial neutral or protonated sites coupled with addition of NO lead to the formation of NH2NO surface species. The mechanisms can be complicated involving many different pathways for the proton transfers, especially for the initial protonated surface. The addition of the doublet NO leading to the formation of NH2NO leads to a reduction of a vanadium and transfer of the spin to this site. NH2NO desorbs and then undergoes gas-phase rearrangements to form the final products N-2 + H2O. The barrier heights for the gas-phase rearrangement process leading to final product formation are comparable in a number of cases to the barrier heights on the catalyst and may represent the rate-determining step. The reaction on the cluster model with a reduced vanadium(+4) proceeds by different paths with addition of NO leading to a second reduced vanadium site. The predicted pathways are consistent with the available experimental data and show that the complete SCR mechanism is very complicated as additional H2O molecules will be removed from the surface by the addition of O-2 to fully regenerate the catalyst and oxidize V back to the formal +5 state.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200016

However, the wild-type enzyme cannot effectively catalyze the C4 hydroxylation of L-Iysine to form the product. To overcome this bottleneck we modified the t-lysine hydroxylase from Niastella koreensis (NkLH4), using the semirational combinatorial active-site saturation test (CAST). We obtained a highly active mutant MT3 (Q161N/T162A/F178Y/E260D) with a 24.97-fold increase of k(cat)/K-m, compared with the wild-type enzyme (791.33 mM(-1) s(-1) vs 31.69 rnM(-1) s(-1)). Further analysis of the structure-activity relationship via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that MT3 had a more flexible conformation, as well as an enlarged substrate-binding pocket with decreased steric hindrance and increased binding energy in substrate recognition. Our study provides a highly active NkLH4 mutant for potential commercial use in the production of enantiomerically pure (2S,4R)-4-hydroxylysine.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200018

An increase in PDH yield via added catalyst activity, lifetime, or selectivity represents significant energy and economic savings. Using Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudate supports as a commercially relevant model system, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats, used to tailor metal-active sites, can increase PDH yield and selectivity. We investigate the interplay of Pt loading, ALD overcoat thickness, and Al2O3 support surface area on PDH activity, selectivity, and catalyst stability to show that applying a 6-8 A thick layer of Al2O3 on low-surface area Al2O3 supports of similar to 90 m(2)/g surface area yields the optimal combination of stability and activity, while increasing propylene selectivity from 91 to 96%. Increased stability upon steaming deactivation occurs because the Al2O3 overcoat prevents the Pt nanoparticles from sintering. We speculate that the ALD overcoat selectively binds to the undercoordinated sites on the Pt nanoparticles, while leaving the more selective terrace sites available for dehydrogenation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200019

The catalyst is an iron center coordinated by the pentadentate macrocycle 2,13-dimethyl-3,6,9,12,18-pentaazabicyclo[12.3.1]octadeca-1(18),2,12,14,16-pentaene (FeN5H2). Catalysis is observed by cyclic voltammetry at a half-wave potential of E-p/2 = -0.98 V vs Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) when FeN5H2, nitrite, and a buffer (pH 7.2) are present. Controlled potential electrolysis of FeN5H2 and nitrite in pH 7.2 buffer at -0.98 V produces hydroxylamine (faradaic efficiency > 90%). FeN5H2 catalyzes ammonium production by disproportionation of hydroxylamine with concomitant formation of nitrous oxide and These results are a rare example of multielectron clectrocatalytic nitrite reduction by an iron complex near neutral pH.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200020

A prospective route for directly obtaining H2O2 is aqueous reduction of O-2 using carbon monoxide (CO) as a reducing agent. However, homogeneous catalysts reported in the literature typically lack the required level of performance in mild ligand-and additive-free conditions. Here, we demonstrate that gold nano-particles supported on titania (Au/TiO2), which is a well-known catalyst for CO oxidation at subambient temperature, can catalyze the formation of H2O2 from the reaction of CO and O-2 in aqueous solution at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. We show that, benefiting from the intrinsic CO/H2O-induced Au-H formation capability of the Au-TiO2 interface, this hitherto unappreciated system can deliver up to 9097 mmol(H2O2) g(Au)(-1) h(-1) efficiency for direct and stable H2O2 production. In addition to the high productivity, a more relevant performance was demonstrated in the vacuum distillative processing of the diluted H2O2-containing streams to furnish a range of pure H2O2 solutions up to 32 wt %. The practical and straightforward application of this H2O2-generating system provides an expedient and efficient entry to establish a sequential tandem process where CO is initially converted to H2O2 and H2O2 subsequently serves as a benign oxidant for selective oxyfunctionalization of aromatic hydrocarbons.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200023

Unlike the mature narrations of the mechanism on the metal catalyst, the mechanism of ODH on the nanocarbon catalyst is still disputable and inconclusive. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and microkinetic modeling (MKM) are combined to provide unique insights into the mechanism. Four possible mechanisms were studied, which are Eley-Rideal (ER), Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH), and Mars-van Krevelen (MvK), together with the reactions between weakly adsorbed species and radicals. The simulation clearly identified the mechanism of the reaction that the ER pathway is more likely than both LH and MvK pathways under various conditions. Carbonyl groups are the main active sites for the first hydrogen abstraction of ethylbenzene. On the other hand, the hydrogen abstraction from intermediate hydrocarbons (such as C6H5CHCH3 center dot) by O-2* and HO2 center dot yields a significant contribution to the total reaction rate under certain conditions. The reaction is first-order in ethylbenzene and zero-order in O-2 when the ratio of reactants nears stoichiometry. Moreover, the defective site does not affect the intrinsic catalytic performance. The defective site is subsequently transformed into the carbonyl group at the steady state and thus increases the number of active sites. This study provides a decisive description of the mechanism of ODH on nanocarbon catalysts under various reaction conditions and sheds light on design of the catalyst and optimization of reaction conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200024

This strategy utilizes abundant saline water as an electrolyte and source of oxygen atoms for functionalization. We present a mechanistic study of ethylene oxidation in saline water using cobalt oxide nanoparticle catalysts. Electrochemical kinetic analysis and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggest that the resting state of the catalyst and the rate-determining step differ for the chlorine evolution reaction in the presence and absence of ethylene. In 0.6 M NaCl pH 8 electrolyte, which resembles seawater, the average current density was similar to 60 mA/cm(2) with a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 41% toward ethylene functionalization. The use of synthetic and natural seawater achieved Faradaic efficiencies above 70%, while the partial current toward the product remained invariant. Further conversion of the initial product 2-chloroethanol into ethylene glycol was also demonstrated. We present a broader vision of harnessing saline water in electrochemical functionalization of organic molecules and coproduction of hydrogen.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200025

Frustrated Lewis Pairs have conceptually revolutionized the activation of inert chemical bonds. Far less developed are hybrid systems containing at least one transition metal as part of the electron-donating/accepting composition. These cooperative transition metal architectures present advantages over traditional systems. For instance, they incorporate, to the concept of FLPs, the movement of electron pairs as typically encountered in the elementary steps of organometallic catalysis. This Perspective presents arguably the most relevant and recent progress of a vivid field of research that aspires to implement cooperative designs in polarized transition metal systems. Moreover, it provides tools for future developments and shows that molecular control over bond-making and -breaking processes can be achieved.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200026

This imposed a requirement that the catalyst return to its original state at the end of each experiment-a complete reversibility requirement. For real catalysts, fulfilling the reversibility requirement is often impossible-catalysts under reaction conditions may change their chemical composition and structure as they become activated or while they are being poisoned through use. It is therefore desirable to develop high-speed methods where transient rates can be quickly measured while catalysts are changing. In this work, we present velocity-resolved kinetics using high-repetition-rate pulsed laser ionization and high-speed ion imaging detection. The reaction is initiated by a single molecular beam pulse incident at the surface, and the product formation rate is observed by a sequence of pulses produced by a high-repetition-rate laser. Ion imaging provides the desorbing product flux (reaction rate) as a function of reaction time for each laser pulse. We demonstrate the principle of this approach by rate measurements on two simple reactions: CO desorption from and CO oxidation on the 332 facet of Pd. This approach overcomes the time-consuming scanning of the delay between CO and laser pulses needed in past experiments and delivers a data acquisition rate that is 10-1000 times higher. We are able to record kinetic traces of CO2 formation while a CO beam titrates oxygen atoms from an O-saturated surface. This approach also allows measurements of reaction rates under diffusion-controlled conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200027	33343999

A Computational Study								ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			14067	14079		10.1021/acscatal.0c03490				DEC 4 2020	2020	Vanadium haloperoxidases are one of the few enzymes in nature that utilize a vanadium center and catalyze the halogenation of substrates through the biosynthesis of hypohalite. Vanadium chloroperoxidases (VCPOs) bind and activate hydrogen peroxide and in a reaction with chloride convert it into hypochlorite as a precursor for a substrate chlorination reaction. Despite the fact that these enzymes have been studied extensively, surprisingly little is known on their catalytic cycle and particularly on the function of the vanadium atom in the reaction mechanism. In order to gain insight into the intricate details of the catalytic cycle of VCPOs, we performed an extensive computational study using large cluster model complexes, where we tested many possible pathways and active-site protonation states. Our work establishes that the biosynthesis of hypochlorite proceeds in two steps: H2O2 activation on the vanadium center to form an end-on V(V)-hydroperoxo complex, followed by OH* transfer from hydroperoxo to chloride on the vanadium center to form hypochlorite. We show that the initial reaction starts with a proton transfer from H2O2 to the equatorial OH group of the V-V(O)(2)(OH)(2)(-) active site, followed by hydroperoxo binding and water release to form the highly stable vanadium-hydroperoxo-dioxo-hydroxo complex. A further proton transfer from an active-site His or Lys residue can lead to the vanadium-peroxo-hydroxo-oxo complex, which we assign as a dead-end complex unable to react further to hypochlorite products. The mechanisms were considered under various protonation state, and it is shown to be the most effective with His(404) singly protonated. The work shows that vanadium is a spectator ion that does not change its oxidation state during the reaction mechanism but holds and positions the H2O2 substrate and guides its proton-relay steps through its oxo and hydroxo ligands. The effect of the protonation state of first- and second-coordination sphere residues and ligands was tested and shows that the reaction is highly sensitive to local changes in the protonation state. Finally, the computations show that the oxygen atom of HOCl exclusively derives from H2O2.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200028

Gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs), composed of solid electrocatalysts on porous supports positioned near the interface of a conducting electrolyte and CO2 gas, have been able to demonstrate the substantial current densities needed for future commercialization. These higher reaction rates have often been ascribed to the presence of a three-phase interface, where solid, liquid, and gas provide electrons, water, and CO2, respectively. Conversely, mechanistic work on electrochemical reactions implicates a fully two-phase reaction interface, where gas molecules reach the electrocatalyst's surface by dissolution and diffusion through the electrolyte. Because the discrepancy between an atomistic three-phase versus two-phase reaction has substantial implications for the design of catalysts, gas-diffusion layers, and cell architectures, the nuances of nomenclatures and governing phenomena surrounding the three-phase-region require clarification. Here we outline the macro, micro, and atomistic phenomena occurring within a gas-diffusion electrode to provide a focused discussion on the architecture of the often-discussed three-phase region for CO2 electrolysis. From this information, we comment on the outlook for the broader CO2 electroreduction GDE cell architecture.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200030

Herein, beta-ketamine/iron complexes, combining a strategy employing in situ generated iodine as a regulator, have been developed for improving the efficiency and robustness of iron-catalyzed ATRP. The catalyst system realizes low catalyst loading, ultrahigh molecular weight, robustness over polar groups, efficient polymerization of acrylate, and forthrightly synthesizing block copolymers, which are challengeable for common iron catalysts. A mechanism was proposed based on experimental results, which mainly involves the ATRP activation process by Fe(II) and the I-2-mediated deactivation process.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200033

The nature of these Sn species was systematically investigated by several approaches, including DRIFT, XPS, UV-vis, and solid-state Sn-119 MAS NMR spectroscopy. The subtle distinctions of the Lewis acidic features between the framework and extraframework Sn sites were identified via acetone-2-C-13, TMPO, and NH3 adsorption, studied via C-13, P-31, and H-1 MAS NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Two types of Lewis acid sites (LAS) have been observed and attributed to (i) framework Sn sites and (ii) extraframework SnOx clusters confined inside the pores or cages of [Si]Beta zeolite, both exhibiting Lewis acid properties. The Lewis acidic characteristics of the extraframework Sn sites were found to depend on the cluster sizes. The confined SnOx clusters with sizes of 0.5-2 nm possess Lewis acidic characteristics similar to those of the framework Sn species and also exhibit a comparable catalytic activity in the Baeyer-Villiger (B-V) oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene oxide hydration. With an increase in size of the SnOx clusters to over 2 nm, the Lewis acidic characteristics of the extraframework Sn species gradually weaken or even disappear.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200034

This win-win situation addresses the ever-increasing problems associated with excessive CO2 emission as well as renewable energy supply. In this contribution, a thorough study is realized on 10 MR zeolites with one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to gasoline (C-5-C-11), with a high fraction of multibranched isoparaffins. Emphasis is placed on identifying the factors that favor isomerization and increase the number of branches on the isomers. Zeolites SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 were configured with Na/Fe3O4 (NaFe) in single-, dual-, and various triple-bed arrangements for this investigation. A dual-bed reaction with SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 coupled individually with the NaFe catalyst showed relatively higher selectivity for low-branched isoparaffins and aromatics, respectively. In the event of combining both the zeolites with NaFe as a physical mix and triple-bed systems, isoparaffins selectivity increased with improved multibranched isomers and reduced aromatics at the same time. Among these different tactics, the triple-bed system comprising the NaFe catalyst followed sequentially with SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 maximizes the selectivity for isoparaffins with the enhanced formation of multibranched isomers. The selectivity of gasoline reached 71.7% in hydrocarbons (HCs) with a maximum of 38.2% isoparaffins possessing a RON value of 91.7 at CO2 conversion of 31.2%. Multibranched isomers accounted for 28.3% in all C5+ isoparaffins, much higher than that of the single zeolite. Purposefully, hypothetical knowledge obtained from the prior model reactions on the zeolites served as a strong foundation to support and give insight into the results from the CO2 hydrogenation reactions.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200036

ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			14195	14200		10.1021/acscatal.0c03059				DEC 4 2020	2020	It is well-known that energy-rich radiation induces water splitting, eventually yielding hydrogen peroxide. Synthetic applications, however, are scarce and to the best of our knowledge, the combination of radioactivity with enzyme-catalysis has not been considered yet. Peroxygenases utilize H2O2 as an oxidant to promote highly selective oxyfunctionalization reactions but are also irreversibly inactivated in the presence of too high H2O2 concentrations. Therefore, there is a need for efficient in situ H2O2 generation methods. Here, we show that radiolytic water splitting can be used to promote specific biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization reactions. Parameters influencing the efficiency of the reaction and current limitations are shown. Particularly, oxidative inactivation of the biocatalyst by hydroxyl radicals influences the robustness of the overall reaction. Radical scavengers can alleviate this issue, but eventually, physical separation of the enzymes from the ionizing radiation will be necessary to achieve robust reaction schemes. We demonstrate that nuclear waste can also be used to drive selective, peroxygenase-catalyzed oxyfunctionalization reactions, challenging our view on nuclear waste in terms of sustainability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200037	33312749

Though their structure and reactivity are of great interest for the design of therapeutics, mechanistic details remain elusive. We reveal within a stereoelectronic link between "the most obscure of all the proteases" and the oxyanion hole of serine proteases-the vivid illustration of nature's catalytic strategy of transition state stabilization. Specifically, rate-limiting breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate is facilitated by n -> pi* donation from the forming C-terminus into an active-site glycine. Cooperative H-bonds strengthen this rare, if not unreported, mode of enzyme catalysis in a fashion resembling that found in serine proteases. Exploiting this interaction provides a strategy for the design of next-generation inhibitors.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200038

The activity of corresponding catalytic coatings strongly depends on material properties such as film thickness, crystallinity, electrical conductivity, and chemical surface speciation. Measuring these properties with high accuracy in vacuum-free and non-destructive methods facilitates the elucidation of structure-activity relationships in realistic environments. Here, we report a novel approach to analyze the optical and electrical properties of highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Using a series of differently calcined, mesoporous, templated iridium oxide films as an example, we assess the film thickness, porosity, electrical resistivity, electron concentration, electron mobility, and interband and intraband transition energies by modeling of the optical spectra. Independently performed analyses using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, ellipsometric porosimetry, X-ray reflectometry, and absorption spectroscopy indicate a high accuracy of the deduced material properties. A comparison of the derived analytical data from SE, resonant photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with activity measurements of the OER suggests that the intrinsic activity of iridium oxides scales with a shift of the Ir 5d t(2g) sub-level and an increase of p-d interband transition energies caused by a transition of mu(1)-OH to p mu(3)-O species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200039

C-13 Solid-State NMR Investigation of n-But-1-ene Transformation on Zn-Modified Zeolite								ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			14224	14233		10.1021/acscatal.0c03647				DEC 4 2020	2020	The analysis of n-but-1-ene transformation on Zn-modified zeolite H-BEA, containing zinc exclusively in the form of either Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA sample) or small clusters of ZnO (ZnO/H-BEA sample), has been performed with C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at 296-673 K. The number of intermediates, including pi-complex of n-but-2-ene, methylallylzinc, and delocalized carbanionic species formed by the interaction of oligomeric polyenes with Zn sites, have been identified for both zeolite samples. Methyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cation and cyclohexadienyl cation are additionally identified for the reaction on ZnO/H-BEA. It is inferred that the aromatization of the olefin occurs basically with the involvement of Zn2+ sites on Zn2+/H-BEA. For ZnO/H-BEA, besides aromatization with the assistance of ZnO species, conjunct polymerization process with the involvement of Bronsted acid sites (BAS) contributes notably to the olefin aromatization. The latter process affords also some quantity of C-1-C-4 alkanes. It is concluded that the stronger interaction of the olefin (confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations) and oligomeric polyenes with Zn2+ cations than with ZnO species and different quantities of BAS for two zeolite samples provide peculiar performances of Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites for the olefin aromatization. Based on careful analysis of the obtained spectroscopic results, it is suggested that Zn-modified zeolite containing Zn2+ cationic species and some quantity of BAS should exhibit higher efficiency as the catalyst for small olefin and alkane aromatization compared to the zeolite with ZnO species and high concentration of BAS.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200040

The developed method tolerates coupling partners with disparate electronic properties and substitution patterns. Di- and trisubstituted alkenes as well as alkenes distal from the directing group are all accommodated. Control experiments are consistent with a N-Ni coordination mode of the directing group, which stands in contrast to a previous report on amide-directed 1,2-diarylation, which involves carbonyl coordination. The synthetic utility of the method arises from the dual function of the sulfonamide as both a directing group and a masked amine nucleophile. This is highlighted by various product diversifications where complex amine compounds are synthesized in a two-step sequence of N-functionalization and deprotection of the sulfonyl group.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200041

We used operando time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and time-resolved isotope labeling experiments coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to elucidate the reaction mechanism and study the active sites and intermediates over a Cu/ZnO catalyst during carbon dioxide conversion into methanol. No reduction of the zinc oxide or formation of a copper-zinc alloy was observed even under highly reducing conditions (IS bar of hydrogen, 260 degrees C), which leads to the conclusion that a copper- zinc alloy phase is not required for high methanol yields and selectivity to be obtained. We attribute the reactive superiority of the copper-zinc-based system to the interplay between copper and zinc oxide phases. Our synthesis protocol provides a way to produce this copper-zinc oxide interface, without having to go through an alloy phase.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200042

The catalytic performance of these catalysts was compared to physical mixtures of zeolite and Pt/gamma-Al2O3 powders, which provide a "microscale" distance between sites. Several beneficial effects on catalytic activity and selectivity for n-heptane hydroisomerization were observed when Pt nanoparticles are located on the gamma-Al2O3 binder in nanoscale proximity with zeolite acid sites, as opposed to Pt nanoparticles located inside zeolite crystals. On ZSM-5-based catalysts, mostly monobranched isomers were produced, and the isomer selectivity of these catalysts was almost unaffected with an intimacy ranging from closest to microscale, which can be attributed to the high diffusional barriers of branched isomers within ZSM-5 micropores. For composite catalysts based on large-pore zeolites (zeolite Beta and zeolite Y), the activity and selectivity benefitted from the nanoscale intimacy with Pt, compared to both the closest and microscale intimacies. Intracrystalline gradients of heptenes as reaction intermediates are likely contributors to differences in activity and selectivity. This paper aims to provide insights into the influence of the metal-acid intimacy in bifunctional catalysts based on zeolites with different framework topologies.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200043	33312750

Designing robust catalysts for the production of olefins is a challenge due to the current lack of clarity on the complex CO2 hydrogenation mechanism. This review aims to elucidate the production of olefins from CO2 with an emphasis on material design and existing mechanistic evidence. The major focus is on catalyst design and structure-activity relationships that can mold future progress in this area with significant relevance to industrial implementation. The mechanisms used in these catalytic routes are discussed at length with appropriate examples. Furthermore, practical reactor design, efficient process engineering, and the importance of life cycle analysis are discussed in depth. These are relevant parameters that need to be integrated with catalyst design to overcome scientific and technological challenges to reach the commercial viability of this technology.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200044

Herein, we report on a transition metal-free supramolecular catalyst composed of V-shaped aromatic amphiphiles and a phenoxazine photoredox catalyst. A nanosized molecular capsule can efficiently uptake an organic photoredox catalyst in water, and the supramolecular catalysis can be tuned by choice of the host-guest combination. This system allows for the effective reduction of organic molecules under visible light irradiation and generates various carbon-centered radicals, such as ketyl radicals, aryl radicals, and trifluoromethyl radicals, for organic reactions in water. In particular, the present supramolecular catalysis turns out to be effective for pinacol couplings compared to the photoredox catalysis in organic solvents, and furthermore, it enables recycling of the catalyst and substrate-selective reactions, which are difficult to be achieved by the conventional photoredox catalysis in organic solvents.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200045

The emerging chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs offers a promising approach along this line as demonstrated by recent achievements. However, the stereocontrol elements in these reactions are not clearly recognized thus far. Herein, we analyze the origin of stereoinduction in direct hydrogenation of imines catalyzed by a set of chiral boranes. We use the tools of computational chemistry to describe the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle, and we pay special attention to the stereoselectivity-determining hydride transfer process. The enantioselectivities predicted by the applied computational approach are in very good agreement with previous experimental observations. We find that the stereoselectivity is governed by a thermodynamically less favored conformer of the borohydride intermediate and not by the experimentally observed form. The most favored hydride transfer transition states are stabilized by specific aryl-aryl and alkyl-aryl noncovalent interactions, which play an important role in stereoinduction. This computational insight is exploited in proposing additional borane variants to improve the enantioselectivity, which could be demonstrated experimentally									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200046

Here, we report that TiO2 loaded with dual cocatalysts, that is, nanometals and cobalt oxide (CoOx) nanoclusters, is capable of selectively catalyzing CH4 to CH3OH at room temperature under photoexcitation using abundant and inexpensive O-2 as an oxidant. The best activity for the formation of the primary products, CH3OOH and CH3OH, is up to 50.8 pmol for 2 h with 95% selectivity. Mechanistic studies elucidate that the superior activity and selectivity result from the synergistic effect of nanometals and CoOx. Nanometals enhance CH4 conversion by promoting the separation of the photoexcited electron and the reduction of O-2. The CoOx mediates a mild CH4 oxidation process by suppressing the formation of highly oxidative (OH)-O-center dot radicals that can further oxidize CH3OH to HCHO and CO2, thereby preserving a high selectivity toward oxygenated products. This work provides a prototype in designing efficient photocatalysts for selective oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH with O-2 under mild conditions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200050

Here, we report the efficient merging catalysis of photoredox-driven dehydrogenative C-C coupling of benzyl alcohol (BA) into hydrobenzoin (HB) and H-2 evolution over the SiO2-supported semiconductor CdS quantum dots (QDs) at ambient temperature and pressure. In this system, we utilize the judicious interfacial engineering approach to rationally assemble OH CdS QDs onto the spherical SiO2 support by which CdS QDs can recycle the scattered light in the near field of SiO2 and achieve the significantly enhanced light-harvesting capability and more efficient generation of charge carriers. Consequently, as compared to bare CdS QDs and Pt/SiO2, the SiO2-supported CdS QDs (CdS/SiO2) exhibits distinctly boosted photoredox-catalyzed activity and stability for C-C coupling of BA into HB and H-2 evolution. The underlying origin toward an efficient C-C coupling reaction over CdS/SiO2 is analyzed accordingly. This work would open a conceptual vista of utilizing a near-field scattering-promoted optical absorption model and nanoscale interfacial assembly method to maneuver the light-capturing property of semiconductor QDs without size alteration for solar fuel production and organic synthesis of fine chemicals.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200051

This approach was effective for a broad scope of amino, alkyl, sulfonyl, and phosphinoyl radical precursors as well as various conjugated beta,gamma-unsaturated carboxylic acids. These reactions also feature high regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance, and simple operation procedure. Mechanistic studies show that the reaction proceeds via copper-catalyzed electrophilic addition onto an olefin followed by decarboxylation, with radical intermediates involved.

Designing selective catalysts for any reaction requires an efficient strategy for discovering predictive structure-activity relationships. Herein, we describe the use of iterative supervised principal component analysis (ISPCA) in de novo catalyst design. The regioselective synthesis of 2,5-dimethyl-1,3,4-triphenyl-1H-pyrrole (C) via a Ti-catalyzed formal [2 + 2 + 1] cycloaddition of phenylpropyne and azobenzene was targeted as a proof of principle. The initial reaction conditions led to an unselective mixture of all possible pyrrole regioisomers. ISPCA was conducted on a training set of catalysts, and their performance was regressed against the scores from the top three principal components. Component loadings from this PCA space and k-means clustering were used to inform the design of new test catalysts. The selectivity of a prospective test set was predicted in silico using the ISPCA model, and optimal candidates were synthesized and tested experimentally. This data-driven predictive-modeling workflow was iterated, and after only three generations the catalytic selectivity was improved from 0.5 (statistical mixture of products) to over 11 (>90% C) by incorporating 2,6-dimethyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pyridine as a ligand. The origin of catalyst selectivity was probed by examining ISPCA variable loadings in combination with DFT modeling, revealing that ligand lability plays an important role in selectivity. A parallel catalyst search using multivariate linear regression (MLR), a popular approach in catalysis informatics, was also conducted in order to compare these strategies in a hypothetical catalyst scouting campaign. ISPCA appears to be more robust and predictive than MLR when sparse training sets are used that are representative of the data available during the early search for an optimal catalyst. The successful development of a highly selective catalyst without resorting to long, stochastic screening processes demonstrates the inherent power of ISPCA in de novo catalyst design and should motivate the general use of ISPCA in reaction development.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900034	34327040

Catalyst [Cp*RhI(C,C')-Triaz] shows a superior catalytic performance in terms of activity and has been applied to the hydrosilylation of a range of linear 1-alkynes and phenylacetylene derivatives with diverse hydrosilanes, including HSiMePh2, HSiMe2Ph, HSiEt3, and the bulkier heptamethylhydrotrisiloxane (HMTS), to afford the corresponding beta-(Z)-vinylsilanes in quantitative yields. The graphene-based hybrid material TRGO-Triaz-Rh(III), featuring cyclometalated [Cp*RhI(C,C')-Triaz] (Triaz = 1,4-diphenyl-3-methyl-1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene) rhodium(III) complexes covalently immobilized through the triazolylidene linker, has been prepared by metalation of the trimethylsilyl-protected 3-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3-triazolium iodide functionalized graphene oxide material, TRGO-Triaz, with [Cp*RhCl2](2) using sodium tert-butoxide as base. The coordination sphere of the supported rhodium(III) complexes has been determined by means of XPS and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, showing the replacement of the iodido ligand by O-functionalities on the carbon wall. In sharp contrast with the homogeneous catalyst, the heterogeneous hybrid catalyst TRGO-Triaz-Rh(III) is not active at room temperature although it shows an excellent catalytic performance at 60 degrees C. In addition, the hybrid catalyst TRGO-Triaz-Rh(III) has shown an excellent recyclability, allowing at least six catalytic runs in the hydrosilylation of oct-1-yne with HSiMePh2 in acetone with complete selectivity to the beta-(Z)-vinylsilane product. The reaction mechanism for the molecular catalyst [Cp*RhI(C,C')-Triaz] has been explored by means of DFT calculations, pointing to a metal-ligand bifunctional mechanism involving reversible cyclometalation that is competitive with a noncooperative pathway. The proposed mechanism entails the Rh-C-Ar assisted hydrosilane activation to afford a reactive Rh-silyl intermediate that leads to a (E)-silylvinylene intermediate after alkyne insertion and a metallacyclopropene-driven isomerization. The release of the beta-(Z)-vinylsilane product can occur by a reversible cyclometalation mechanism involving sigma-CAM with the C-Ar-H bond or, alternatively, the Si-H bond of an external hydrosilane. The energy barrier for the latter is 1.2 kcal.mol(-1) lower than that of the C-Ar-H bond, which results in a small energy span difference that makes both pathways competitive under catalytic conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900021

Due to their high selectivity, enzymes have become an essential tool for C-H bond activation and offer complementary reactivity to small-molecule catalysts. Hemoproteins, particularly cytochromes P450, have proven to be effective for selective oxidation of unactivated C-H bonds. Previously, we reported the in vitro characterization of an oxidative tailoring cascade in which TamI, a multifunctional P450, functions co-dependently with the TamL flavoprotein to catalyze regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation and epoxidation to yield tirandamycin A and tirandamycin B. TamI follows a defined order including (1) C10 hydroxylation, (2) C11/C12 epoxidation, and (3) C18 hydroxylation. Here, we present a structural, biochemical, and computational investigation of TamI to understand the molecular basis of its substrate binding, diverse reactivity, and specific reaction sequence. The crystal structure of TamI in complex with tirandamycin C, together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and targeted mutagenesis, suggests that hydrophobic interactions with the polyene chain of its natural substrate are critical for molecular recognition. Quantum mechanics calculations and MD simulations of TamI with variant substrates provided detailed information on the molecular basis of sequential reactivity and pattern of regio- and stereoselectivity in catalyzing the three-step oxidative cascade.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900029	33569241

This revolutionary tool is promising to treat a myriad of human genetic diseases. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of DNA cleavage, which is a fundamental step for genome editing, has not been established. Here, quantum-classical molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy methods are used to disclose the two-metal-dependent mechanism of phosphodiester bond cleavage in CRISPR-Cas9. Ab initio MD reveals a conformational rearrangement of the Mg2+-bound RuvC active site, which entails the relocation of H983 to act as a general base. Then, the DNA cleavage proceeds through a concerted associative pathway fundamentally assisted by the joint dynamics of the two Mg2+ ions. This clarifies previous controversial experimental evidence, which could not fully establish the catalytic role of the conserved H983 and the metal cluster conformation. The comparison with other two-metal-dependent enzymes supports the identified mechanism and suggests a common catalytic strategy for genome editing and recombination. Overall, the non-target DNA cleavage catalysis described here resolves a fundamental open question in the CRISPR-Cas9 biology and provides valuable insights for improving the catalytic efficiency and the metal-dependent function of the Cas9 enzyme, which are at the basis of the development of genome editing tools.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900043	33520346

The mechanism of the multistepped reaction, especially four-electron oxidation to O-2, has not yet been understood. Although some intermediate states have been detected in transient spectroscopy, O-2 evolution kinetics remain unknown at the end of consecutive reaction steps. We apply operando O-2 detection with a microelectrode to determine the absolute evolution rate on a highly efficient SrTiO3 photocatalyst film casted on a glass plate. The evolution rate was determined with a time resolution of 0.1 s, which was improved by 1000 times compared with that in widely used gas-chromatographic detection. The observed rate did not respond instantaneously to excitation light irradiation. When light was turned on, the photocatalyst film was inactive for evolution and light-activated in seconds. It was proposed that the first absorbed photons were consumed to fill trap states on SrTiO3 surface and then the latter photons drove steady O-2 evolution. When excitation light stopped, the O-2 evolution rate exponentially decayed in seconds. The microelectrode method demonstrated herein will be useful for understanding many other reaction kinetics at liquid-solid interfaces.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900001

Here we show a versatile nanoconfined ionic liquids (ILs) design to tune the interactions between CO2 and single-Ni-site, meanwhile create a solid/liquid interface with high CO2 concentration for efficient CO2 electrocatalysis. The Ni-N catalyst confined with ILs can be directly used with aqueous electrolytes to mitigate the mass transport and conductivity issues typically associated with viscous bulk ILs electrolytes. Density functional theory studies reveal that the d-band center of Ni atoms is positively shifted to the Fermi level in the presence of IL, and consequently the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step of CO2 reduction, CO2(g) -> COOH*, drops significantly from 1.49 to 0.80 eV. The nanoconfined ILs intensify CO2 conversion by showing a high CO Faradaic efficiency of above 98%, enhanced current densities up to 66.1 mA cm(-2), and robust stability over 50 h.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900003

For this, we calculate acidity constants at surface sites through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and a Grand Canonical formulation of adsorbates. The resulting pH values at the point of zero charge show excellent agreement with experiment and thereby support the validity of our approach. By combining information concerning the surface coverage with the alignment of the band edges with respect to the relevant redox levels, we scrutinize the potential of the considered semiconductors as photocatalysts and identify the corresponding optimal pH ranges for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. More specifically, our results indicate that GaN stands out among these semiconductors as the most promising candidate for the overall water splitting, with the potential of further improvement through alloying.

Photocatalytic alpha-Alkylation of Amines with Alkyl Halides								ACS CATALYSIS				10	22			13196	13201		10.1021/acscatal.0c04519				NOV 20 2020	2020	alpha-Branched amines represent essential building blocks for organic synthesis. They are traditionally prepared through nucleophilic addition to imines. These methods often require highly reactive organometallic reagents and proceed under rigorous air- and moisture-free conditions. Here we describe an alternative approach that involves a C-alkylation of amines with alkyl bromides. Mechanistically, the reaction likely involves photocatalytic generation of an alpha-amino radical and a stabilized carbon-centered radical (allyl, benzyl, alpha-carbonyl) followed by radical recombination. This approach offers a mild, atom-economical, redox neutral synthesis of alpha-branched amines that shows broad scope and avoids premetalated reagents.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900006

Nevertheless, the detailed mechanism of this reaction, proceeding via either the Pd(II)-carbenoid or the pi-allyl-Pd(II) intermediate, still remains debatable. Herein, computational studies were performed to provide mechanistic insights into the reactions, and substituent-dependent mechanistic pathways were revealed. Computational results suggest that the substituents, R-1-R-3 attached to 1,2-allenyl ketones and R-4 attached to the aryl moiety of aryl halides, could play significant roles in the variation of the mechanistic pathway. It would be favorable to form the Pd(II)-carbenoid intermediate when R-1 is an aryl/alkyl group or steric hindrance is present between R-2 and R-3. For the substrate of aryl halide, the aryl moiety bearing electron-donating group (R-4) at the para position is more ready to undergo migratory insertion to form the pi-allyl-Pd(II) intermediate than that with electron-withdrawing group. The factors responsible for the formation of both Pd(II)-carbenoid and pi-allyl-Pd(II) intermediates are discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900007

Machine learning (ML) as a starring tool in data science brings new opportunities for chemists to interpret, simulate, and predict complex reactions in heterogeneous catalysis. Here we review the current status of ML methods and applications in heterogeneous catalysis by following two main streams: the top-down approach by learning experiment data and the bottom-up approach for making predictions from first-principles, which differ in the data source. We focus more on the latter, where ML interacts intimately with first-principles calculations for predicting the key properties (e.g., molecular adsorption energy) and evaluating potential energy surface (PES) to expedite the atomic simulation. The ML-based PES exploration represents the top gear that can largely replace the traditional roles of first-principles calculations for structure determination and activity evaluation but requires efficient methods for data set generation, sensitive structure descriptors to discriminate structures, and iterative self-learning to refine the ML potential. We illustrate these key ingredients of ML-based atomic simulation using the SSW-NN method developed by our group as the example. Three cases of SSW-NN application are presented to elaborate how ML can expedite the material and reaction simulation and lead to new findings on catalyst structure and reaction channels. The future directions of ML-based applications in heterogeneous catalysis are also discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900008

Herein, the strong interaction between metal oxide and carbon supports is discovered to significantly boost the performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A molecular engineering strategy is designed to develop undoped, N-doped, S-doped, and N,S-codoped porous carbon supports with similar physical properties (denoted as C, NC, SC, and NSC, respectively). These supports can host high-density SnO2 nanoparticles (over 60 wt. %) in a small size of similar to 3.5 nm and good distribution, providing an excellent platform to understand the strong metal oxide-support interaction (SMOSI) and their influence on electrocatalytic performance. Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations discover the SMOSI between SnO2 nanoparticles and carbon supports in an order of SnO2/NSC > SnO2/NC > SnO2/SC > SnO2/C. Such SMOSI enables the effective electron transfer from carbon support to SnO2 nanoparticles, strengthening the adsorption of key reaction intermediate of CO2 center dot- and thus promoting CO2RR. With the strongest SMOSI, SnO2/NSC exhibits significantly enhanced selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high faradaic efficiency of 94.4% and an extraordinary partial current density of 56.0 mA.cm(-2) in an H-cell, outperforming the majority of Sn-based catalysts. Notably, SMOSI can simultaneously secure the active sites and thus remarkably enhance their catalytic durability, making it a promising strategy for exploring efficient and stable catalysts for diverse applications.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900009

To this end, we have developed a reaction monitoring platform capable of automated sampling and online HPLC analysis to generate temporal profiles for reactions performed from within a glovebox. The device allows for facile reaction progress analysis to aid in mechanistic studies of air-sensitive chemical transformations. The platform has demonstrated high reproducibility regarding sample mixing, dilution, delivery, and analysis. We employed the sampling platform to acquire temporal profiles for a series of Buchwald-Hartwig aminations. Parallel coupling reactions using iodobenzene and bromobenzene both exhibit complex kinetics. A competition reaction including both aryl halides demonstrated high selectivity for iodobenzene indicative of catalyst monopoly. The temporal profile for the difunctionalized substrate 1,4-iodobromobenzene was unexpected based on our parallel and competition studies and is indicative of a distinct underlying mechanism. We attribute this unanticipated reactivity to intramolecular catalyst transfer through the p system as seen in "living" polymerization transfer catalyst systems. The use of this automated sampling platform has greatly increased mechanistic understanding despite performing only a small number of experiments.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900010

The fundamental mechanisms, however, remain unclear. In this work, via multistate QM/MM theory, we report our discovery that the SAM activation mechanism in the radical SAM enzymes Dph2 and PFL-AE is controlled by the binding structure of SAM to a [4Fe-4S] cluster cofactor. Two distinguishing types of SAM binding structures, different in the orientation of the C-S bond to be cleaved in SAM relative to the SAM-binding iron, led separately to a concerted and a stepwise pathway to form the Omega-type species, a key type of bio-organometallic intermediates captured experimentally for these two enzymes. This theoretically deciphered determinant from Dph2 and PFL-AE for the mechanistic dichotomy enables a prediction of the SAM activation pathway adopted in many other radical SAM enzymes, which opens up an avenue for understanding the SAM activation in the radical SAM enzymes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900011

Such reactions are often diffusion controlled and require multiple catalyst interactions at high dilution. We developed a confined dual-catalytic polymer nanoreactor that enforces catalyst colocalization to enhance reactivity in a fully homogeneous system. The photoredox-catalyzed dimerization of substituted styrenes is disclosed using confined-single-chain polymers bearing triarylpyrylium-based pendants, with pyrene as an electron relay catalyst. Enhanced reactivity with low catalyst loadings was observed compared to monocatalytic polymers with small-molecule additives and analogous small molecules. Our approach realizes a dual-catalytic single-chain polymer that provides enhanced reactivity under confinement, presenting a further approach for diffusion-limited-photoredox catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900012

The activity of all Pt catalysts examined here decreased by water molecules formed during stoichiometric oxidation of ethylene and became stable steadily. A mesoporous silica-supported Pt catalyst improved its steady-state activity after calcination of the support in air at 800 degrees C, whereas no such effect was observed for a nonporous silica support. CO-pulse titration, H2O adsorption measurements, Si-29 MAS NMR, and in situ FTIR along with catalytic activity studies revealed that the activity of the mesoporous silica-supported Pt catalyst is higher than that of nonporous silica-supported ones, despite showing similar hydrophobicity and low Pt dispersion. In situ characterization using CO as a molecular probe indicates that a part of the Pt surface inside hydrophobic mesopores is not involved in the hydrogenbonding network among physisorbed water molecules and surface SiOH groups even after full hydration of the catalyst surface, and bare Pt sites are expected to work more effectively for ethylene oxidation. Such a "hydrophobic Pt surface" can only be formed on a hydrophobic mesoporous silica support, which is probably because of Pt nanoparticles surrounded by a hydrophobic siloxane network entirely. A unique environment derived from the condensed siloxane network and restricted mesopores contributes largely to the high activity of Pt nanoparticles for low-temperature oxidation of trace ethylene.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900013

These protocols rely on a few photocatalysts that can only convert a small portion of visible light (<500 nm) into chemical energy. The high-energy photons that excite the photocatalyst can result in unwanted side reactions. Dyes that absorb a much broader spectrum of light are not applicable because of their short-lived singlet excited states. Here, we describe a self-assembling catalyst system that overcomes this limitation. Immobilization of a nickel catalyst on dye-sensitized titanium dioxide results in a material that catalyzes carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bond formations. The modular approach of dye-sensitized metallaphotocatalysts accesses the entire visible light spectrum and allows tackling selectivity issues resulting from low wavelengths strategically. The concept overcomes current limitations of metallaphotocatalysis by unlocking the potential of dyes that were previously unsuitable.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900014

Although In2O3/Pd have been employed as efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, the electronic effects by strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pd and In2O3 are poorly understood, which is greatly affected by the morphology of In2O3. Herein, we use MIL-68(In) nanorod as a morphological template for the synthesis of hollow In2O3 nanotubes (h-In2O3) and the preparation of supported Pd catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Interestingly, loading Pd on h-In2O3 showed a much higher performance than In2O3 with other morphologies, which exhibited almost unchanged CO2 conversion of 10.5%, methanol selectively of 72.4%, and methanol space-time yield of 0.53 g(MeOH) h(-1) g(cat)(-1) over 100 h on stream at 3 MPa and 295 degrees C. After in-depth characterizations, we found that the different electronic properties of Pd species on In2O3 can be finely tuned by diverse synthetic conditions, which were responsible for high activity and stability. The molar fraction of Pd2+ species in the h-In2O3/Pd catalyst reached 67.6%, 3.2 times that of the In2O3@Pd catalyst (21.3%), due to the different surface chemistry of In2O3. Density function theory results indicated that the Pd donated more electrons to the curved In2O3 (222) surface than the pristine surface, and Pd2+ was critical to facilitate H-2 adsorption and formation of the surface oxygen vacancy. This work demonstrates that controlling the morphology of In2O3 can modify both the Pd electronic property and SMSI between Pd and In2O3, which are the origins of the high catalytic performance.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900015

Herein, we constructed an IBS by using reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to integrate Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (SW) cells and Cu2O, which exhibited a 11-38-fold enhancement of photocatalytic H-2 production compared with RGO-free IBSs (Cu2O/SW and Cu2O/organic electron mediator/ SW). Further analysis revealed that RGO provided multifunctional contributions to H-2 production from IBS, that is, sufficient area for IBS supporting, efficient photoelectron collection from Cu2O, and effective electron distribution into the cells. This study offers opportunities for rationally designing electron transfer pathways to achieve high-performance IBSs.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900016

A rhodium catalyst generally used in nitrene chemistry gave amide C-N insertion products and/or the corresponding ketones, whereas a silver catalyst with an achiral bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand provided C-H insertion products.

However, it has been synthetically challenging to create strong interactions between the MoSx catalyst layer and the metallic support material while maintaining high surface area and solution dispersibility for the composite catalyst. In this work, we utilize colloidal ligand-exchange methods to adsorb a single layer of tetrathiometallate complex (MoS42-, WS42-) onto colloidal Au nanoparticles and characterize the influence of the Au support on the electronic and geometric properties of the surface MSx monolayer. Utilizing spectroscopic and computational methods, we show that the Au surface templates cross-linked oligomers of MoSx to generate highly active bridging disulfide moieties and tunes the hydrogen atom binding energies through strong covalent Au-S interactions. These Au@MoS4 nanoparticles are easily incorporated into high surface area electrodes and are able to achieve 100 mA/cm(2) of hydrogen evolution current density at 171 mV of overpotential.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900018

Here, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics and free energy (potential of mean force, PMF) simulations are performed to understand structural and dynamic properties of the reactive state of the SETD3-substrate complex for the methylation process and study the catalytic mechanism of the SETD3 methyltransferase. It is demonstrated that the reactive state for methylation in which His73 adopts the N-delta 1-H pi tautomeric form is stable and His73 is well positioned at the SETD3 active site for accepting the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Moreover, the imidazole ring of His73 in the reactive state has a similar orientation to methylated His73 (His73Me) in the product complex. The results suggest that the imidazole ring of His73 does not undergo rotation during the methyl transfer, and this suggestion is further supported by the results of the PMF simulations for the rotation around the C beta-C-gamma bond in the reactive state as well as classical MD simulations. The free energy simulations are also performed for the methyl transfer from SAM to N-epsilon 2 of the N-delta 1-H pi tautomer of His73 in wild-type SETD3 as well as in Asn255Ala and Tyr312Phe mutants. It is shown that the free energy barrier increases by approximately 2-4 kcal mol(-1) as a result of these mutations, consistent with the experimental observations. The implication for the existence of the stable reactive state for methylation with well-positioned His73 in the SETD3-substrate complex is discussed, and the origin of the increase of the free energy barrier as a result of the mutations is proposed.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900019

Here, we design an efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, coating of WN nanowire core with a Ni(OH)(2) shell supported on a carbon fiber paper (WN-Ni(OH)(2)). In a 1 M KOH solution, the hierarchical electrocatalyst affords a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 170 mV and 100 mA cm(-2) at 245 mV. The enhanced performance of WN-Ni(OH)(2) in the HER is attributed to the synergy between WN and Ni(OH)(2): during water dissociation, hydroxyl groups are preferentially adsorbed on WN and hydrogen on Ni(OH)(2); meanwhile, Ni(OH)(2) could promote hydroxyl group desorption from WN. Thus, the full-surface Volmer reaction kinetics could be enhanced. As a consequence, the WN-Ni(OH)(2) has a reduced activation energy of the HER and enhanced intrinsic activity performance. Meanwhile, the hybrid can reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 339 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and an overpotential of 510 mV for the full water-splitting reaction. This interfacial cooperation offers a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst, as well as a hopeful strategy for fabricating efficient nitride-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900020

In this context, the well-established methods of strong electrostatic adsorption and electroless deposition (ED) have been used to synthesize highly dispersed Ag/Ir on different alumina supports (delta,theta-Al2O3 and gamma-Al2O3). The surface free energy (SFE) of Ag (1302 erg/cm(2)) is much lower than that of Ir (3231 erg/cm(2)); surface thermodynamics dictate the Ir-Ag system should arrange to give the lowest free energy of an Ag layer localized on the Ir surface to minimize the high SFE of Ir. The catalysts remained dispersed at high-temperature annealing treatments (400, 600, and 800 degrees C). For all Ag-Ir/delta,theta-Al2O3 samples, H-2 chemisorption values were higher after annealing at 400 and 600 degrees C than at 200 degrees C and were considerably higher than for the corresponding 1.0 wt % Ir/delta,theta-Al2O3 used as the base catalyst. X-ray diffraction data and scanning transmission electron microscopy images indicate that both monometallic catalysts sintered, but deposition of an Ag shell by ED prevented the sintering of both Ag and Ir. Temperature-programmed desorption of H2 measurements corroborates the high H-2 uptake chemisorption experiments and indicated the additional H-2 capacity was because of more weakly bound H. Computational and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results suggest the excess H-2 chemisorption can be accounted for by binding up to four H atoms to single-surface Ir atoms surrounded by Ag in the shell of the bimetallic catalysts that have been pretreated at temperatures >400 degrees C. As a result, H-2 capacity increases from the normal adsorption stoichiometry of H/Ir = 1:1 up to as high as 4:1.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900022

The bda complex prefers the front-to-front geometry, while the pda complex favors the front-to-back geometry in the formation of prereactive geometry. In the bda complex, the hydrophobic oxo will point at another oxo with the bda directed toward water, which favors the I2M mechanism. In the pda complex, the hydrophobic oxo instead is directed toward a more hydrophobic phenanthroline moiety of the pda of another species, which disfavors I2M. The binding free energy of the nonproductive front-to-back of pda is 3 kcal mol(-1) more stable than that of the prereactive dimer. This incorrect orientation leads to an additional rearrangement required before the O-O bond can be formed. Estimation of the rate constant shows 2 orders of magnitude lower reactivity for the I2M mechanism of the pda complex relative to the bda complex, which makes the water nucleophilic attack mechanism competitive.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900023

Conventionally, such catalysts are constructed by directly embedding a catalytically active acid site into the structure of a porous material, linking the acid properties with the properties of the embedding solid. In this work, a holoenzyme mimicking approach was used, in which a self-assembled hexameric resorcinarene capsule (1.4 nm(3) cavity) acts like an apoenzyme that transforms into a catalytically active site by hosting hydrated HCl as a cofactor. This capsule binds the hydronium ion together with cyclohexanol (CyOH) and catalyzes the dehydration to cyclohexene with enhanced rates that are 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the unconstrained environment. Kinetic analysis shows that cyclohexanol dehydration proceeds via an E2 mechanism on hydrated HCl in the unconstrained environment, while the constrained environment of the active capsule induces the stabilization of an ionic intermediate, allowing an E1 mechanism to dominate. By comparison with the reaction in zeolite environments, we show that the direct chemical environment of the capsule or a zeolite wall exerts only a minor direct influence. The volume constraint increases the reaction rate by inducing a larger activation entropy, indicating the stabilization of a later transition state in the E1 mechanism, as well as a higher reaction space of the carbenium ion constituting the transition state.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900024

For instance, not a single defined enzyme has been described for the reduction of the C = N bond of an oxime, only whole organisms. Such an enzymatic reduction of an oxime may give access to (chiral) amines. By serendipity, we found that the oxime moiety adjacent to a ketone as well as an ester group can be reduced by ene-reductases (ERs) to an intermediate amino group. ERs are well-known enzymes for the reduction of activated alkenes, as of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones. For the specific substrate used here, the amine intermediate spontaneously reacts further to tetrasubstituted pyrazines. This reduction reaction represents an unexpected promiscuous activity of ERs expanding the toolkit of transformations using enzymes.									2	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900025	33251037

Functional nanocarbon materials have been extensively exploited as heterogeneous catalysts to drive catalytic ozonation because of the environmental-benign process, easy applicability, and high efficiency. Nevertheless, the bottlenecks in the processes are the economical production of high-performance and robust carbocatalysts and the debatable oxidation regimes. Different active sites have been suggested in engineered nanocarbons, and the corresponding mechanisms of the carbocatalytic ozonation are ambiguous including the evolution of various ROS, occurrence of radical and nonradical reaction pathways, selectivity toward organics, and tunable oxidation capacity. In this Review, we will showcase the roadmap of the development of reaction-oriented carbocatalysts and clarify the arguments in the mechanisms of the intrinsic active sites, identification of ROS, reaction intermediates, and oxidation pathways in carbocatalytic ozonation. We will provide critical comments and innovative strategies on the mechanistic investigations in carbon-based ozonation from the molecular level (electronic structures) to macroscale (kinetics), by deliberate radical screening/capture techniques, advanced characterizations and in situ analysis, and theoretical computations. More importantly, the critical issues and future directions will be proposed in the rational material/system design, mechanistic exploration, and the implementation of this powerful technology in catalytic oxidation and real wastewater treatment.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900026

Propylene epoxidation using molecular oxygen could replace the tedious current synthesis protocols, which use expensive H2O2 or organic peroxides as oxidants. This review focuses on the propylene epoxidation reaction using molecular oxygen in the gas phase over copper- and silver-based catalysts. Silver is a proven and industrially used ethylene epoxidation catalyst. However, it initiates allylic hydrogen stripping (AHS) in propylene epoxidation, shifting the selectivity toward unwanted acrolein and total oxidation. Nevertheless, silver has been extensively studied to determine if AHS could be mitigated by targeted active site design and various doping strategies. Copper-based catalysts have been less extensively studied but have been experimentally proved as well as theoretically confirmed that their PO selectivity is on par with that of silver. In this review, different catalyst modification strategies have been analyzed and the achieved improvements discussed. Theoretical approaches aimed at understanding the mechanism and predicting catalytic performance on the basis of electronic states (density functional theory calculations) are also reviewed. We conclude with a future outlook on how the current state of the art knowledge of active site modification and reaction engineering approaches could leverage the PO selectivity toward industrial requirements, thus enabling a breakthrough in gas-phase propylene epoxidation using O-2.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900027

This study demonstrates the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity of a Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite (A(n+1)BnO(3n+1), n = 3) as a bifunctional material [i.e., RPLaSr3(Co0.5Fe0.5)(3)O10-delta] for oxygen electrocatalysis via an optimal doping strategy. The improved performance mainly benefits from the enhanced oxygen vacancies, the facile oxygen release and incorporation abilities, the synergistic interplay of Co and Fe together with the increased amounts of adsorbed OH-/O-2, and the highly oxidative O-2(2-)/O-. The more positive onset potential (Eonset) and the highest half wave potential (E-1/2) of RP-LaSr3(Co0.5Fe0.5)(3)O10-delta imply a better ORR activity relative to those of the benchmark Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O2.59 (BSCF) and the widely referred cubic perovskite (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (CP-LSCF). Furthermore, this material enables the electrochemical reduction of O-2 by 4e(-) to OH- with an impressive stability. More importantly, RP-LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-delta shows a largely narrowed potential gap (.E) and achieves its minimum value of 0.91 V, remarkably smaller than those of CP-LSCF (1.01 V), BSCF (1.04 V), and most of the state-of-the-art bifunctional materials. This study paves an attractive way to accurately fabricate RP-type perovskites as highly efficient and stable materials for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900028

Initially, we analyzed the reaction mechanism for the observed hydrolysis at the Asn44-Arg45 site in the hen egg-white lysozyme protein (HEWL) by the Zr-substituted Lindqvist anion [W5O18Zr(H2O)(OH)](3-) (ZrL) using cluster models obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, and metadynamics simulations. The mechanism characterization shows that the overall activity is governed by the energy cost to reach the transition state for C-N bond cleavage from the reactants, resulting in a calculated overall free-energy barrier of 121 kJ mol(-1) that is in excellent agreement with the values derived from the experimental rate constants (113-134 kJ mol(-1)). In addition, QM/MM metadynamics simulations on the early stages of the mechanism revealed the formation of an exergonic non-covalent POM center dot center dot center dot protein complex at the protein surface that was stabilized by positively charged amino acids maintained during the Zr coordination to the amide oxygen. For nonreactive related sites containing Arg (Asn113-Arg114, Arg45-Asn46, and Arg21-Gly22,) we found very similar overall barriers within the cluster model approach (124, 124, and 120 kJ mol(-1), respectively); however, their nonbonding POM center dot center dot center dot protein interactions along the simulated coordination of Zr to the amide oxygen were significantly weaker than those for the reactive Asn44-Arg45 site. Thus, for the HEWL protein the selectivity is governed by an enzyme-like recognition of ZrL at the cleavage site that results in an overall acceleration of the reaction rate compared to those at other sites. Conversely for human serum albumin, (HSA) the observed selectivity was not directed by nonbonding POM center dot center dot center dot protein interactions but instead was controlled by the protein secondary structure. Calculations on several Arg-Leu sites placed in positive patches showed that peptide bonds in an alpha-helix structure have higher overall free-energy barriers, while for the active Arg114=Leu115 site in a random coil region the C-N cleavage is facilitated by the extended conformation of the protein chain. All in all, this study has identified and evaluated two complementary factors controlling the selectivity in peptide hydrolysis promoted by transition metal-substituted POMs; hydrolysis is disfavored at alpha-helical regions of the protein, and then specific positively charged patches can trap the POM via electrostatic-type POM center dot center dot center dot protein interactions and accelerate the reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900030

Yet, limited effort was devoted to understand the effect of ligand coverage and postsynthesis treatments on CO2 reduction, especially under industrially applicable conditions, such as at high currents (>100 mA/cm(2)) using gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) and flow reactors. In this work, Cu-Ag core-shell nanoparticles (11 +/- 2 nm) were prepared with three different surface modes: (i) capped with oleylamine, (ii) capped with monoisopropylamine, and (iii) surfactant-free with a reducing borohydride agent; Cu-Ag (OAm), Cu-Ag (MIPA), and Cu-Ag (NaBH4), respectively. The ligand exchange and removal was evidenced by infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis, whereas high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed their effect on the interparticle distance and nanoparticle rearrangement. Later on, we developed a process-on-substrate method to track these effects on CO2R. Cu-Ag (OAm) gave a lower on-set potential for hydrocarbon production, whereas Cu-Ag (MIPA) and Cu-Ag (NaBH4) promoted syngas production. The electrochemical impedance and surface area analysis on the well-controlled electrodes showed gradual increases in the electrical conductivity and active surface area after each surface treatment. We found that the increasing amount of the triple phase boundaries (the meeting point for the electron-electrolyte-CO2 reactant) affect the required electrode potential and eventually the C+2 (e) over bar/C-2 (e) over bar product ratio. This study highlights the importance of the electron transfer to those active sites affected by the capping agents-particularly on larger substrates that are crucial for their industrial application.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900031

Catalytic hydroboration studies routinely investigated the decomposition of HBcat but in the case of HBpin, decomposition is not commonly considered because of its perceived stability. Organoboranes catalyze the hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes; these species can be formed from the facile decomposition of 1,3,2-dioxaborolanes (e.g., HBcat and HBpin) by nucleophiles and Lewis acids. Similarly, the nucleophilic decomposition of 1,3,2-dioxaborolanes to borohydride species can catalyze the reduction of carbonyl derivatives. These motifs are abundant in hydroboration catalysis; therefore, the potential for hidden boron catalysis is high and must be controlled for. This Perspective discusses the current methods for probing 1,3,2-dioxaborolane decomposition, highlights the need to consider this hidden catalysis in the future development of hydroboration catalysis, and proposes a set of protocols for the identification of hidden boron catalysis.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900032

Given the abundance of their components, large surface area and high laboratory-scale activities, MXenes are promising catalysts and supports for several heterogeneous catalytic and electrocatalytic reactions. This Perspective briefly summarizes the most relevant (electro)catalytic processes where MXenes hold promise as competitive alternatives to traditional Pt-group catalysts. We discuss how the interplay of metal elements with carbon, nitrogen, and various surface terminations modulates the catalytic activity of MXenes. In particular, we analyze the connection between experimental and simulated MXene structures and discuss the differences with bulk carbide extended surfaces. The great advances in synthesis routes and upscaling, in combination with realistic computational models, may give MXenes a leading role in the current quest for efficient catalytic processes.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900033

However, the well-known proximity-dependent selectivity observed in several high-profile experiments is yet to be understood. Here, we reveal that such dependence is closely associated with the kinetics involved. Based on reaction-diffusion dynamics together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulation on a coarse-grained model, one famous example, namely, the proximity-dependent selectivity from carbon dioxide to liquid fuels on a bifunctional catalyst composed of HZSM-5 and In2O3, has been systematically examined. It is found that the diffusion kinetics of the intermediate methanol generated on In2O3 plays a decisive role for the selectivity. For different In2O3/HZSM-5 proximities, the local methanol concentration induces a shift of the dominant process for subsequent methanol-to-hydrocarbon reactions inside HZSM-5, resulting in a preferred reaction window to generate favorable liquid fuels with profound high selectivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of kinetic effects in the design of multifunctional catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900035

In this study, we have engineered a functional and stable self-sufficient chimeric peroxygenase-oxidase fusion. The bifunctional biocatalyst carried a laboratory-evolved version of the fungal peroxygenase fused to an evolved fungal aryl-alcohol oxidase that supplies H2O2 in situ. Enzyme fusion libraries with peptide linkers of different sizes and amino acid compositions were designed, while attached leader sequences favored secretion in yeast. The most promising functional enzyme fusions were characterized biochemically and further tested for the synthesis of dextrorphan, a metabolite of the antitussive drug dextromethorphan. This reaction system was optimized to control the aromatic alcohol transformation rate, and therefore the H2O2 supply, to achieve total turnover numbers of 62,000, the highest value reported for the biocatalytic synthesis of dextrorphan to date. Accordingly, our study opens an avenue for the use of peroxygenase-aryl alcohol oxidase fusions in the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900036

Using an illustrative example and supporting theory, we show that: (i) for small variations in the parameters, global sensitivities are similar to local derivatives; (ii) for larger variations in the parameters (i.e., a larger parameter space), the global sensitivities provide a ranking of importance of parameters and impose a rigorous bound on the errors that arise from fixing one or more parameters to nominal values; and (iii) in general, the global sensitivities can be related to the extrema of local derivatives. We argue that the square root of the total global sensitivity of a parameter, computed by summing the global sensitivity of that parameter acting independently and in combination with others, is a "global" degree of rate control for catalytic systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900037

In this article, a Pt@TiOx/TiO2 catalyst with platinum nanoparticles decorated by amorphous TiOx overlayers was synthesized via a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)-related strategy. The Pt-TiOx electronic interaction stabilized reactive Pt-0 sites during reactions, resulting in outstanding activities and high stability for C3H8 and C3H6 combustion. The influences of sulfates-common byproducts forming on catalysts applied for automobile exhaust purification-were studied by monitoring the platinum states, the hydrocarbon adsorption behavior, and the catalytic performance of sulfated Pt@TiOx/TiO2 with in situ DRIFTS. It is suggested that the sulfates promoted C3H8 combustion via heterolytic C-H bond activation on Pt delta+-(SO4)(delta-) couples, while C3H6 combustion was disfavored on the sulfated catalyst because of inhibited O-2 activation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900038

Researchers have recently discovered that a class of cationic Co(II) complexes of the formula [Co-II(PP)(acac)](+) (PP = diphosphine, acac = acetylacetonate) can catalyze hydroformylation with activity approaching that of the widely used rhodium catalysts (Hood, D. M. et al. Science 2020, 367, 542-548). This density functional theory (DFT) study reveals the detailed workings of the cationic Co(II) catalyst system. The precatalyst [Co-II(PP)(acac)](+) is initiated by reacting with H-2 and CO to generate active species [HCoII(CO)(2)(PP)](+). In comparison with the 18-electron neutral Co(I) catalytic species HCoI(CO)(3)(PR3), these cationic Co(II) species, with their unique 17-electron and square pyramidal structure, invoke a lower-energy pathway through different elementary steps such as associative alkene uptake and heterolytic H-2 cleavage. The regioselectivity for linear aldehyde products is due to a combination of electronic and steric effects that favor the anti-Markovnikov insertion of a terminal alkene into the Co-H bond. DFT calculations predict that addition of PMe3 would facilitate the precatalyst initiation, thereby decreasing the reaction temperature or shortening the induction period. The insights gained by this theoretical study can be useful for the further development of hydroformylation catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900040		
J	Fan, Jiaxuan; Du, Haoxuan; Zhao, Yin; Wang, Qian; Liu, Yanan; Li, Dianqing; Feng, Junting								Recent Progress on Rational Design of Bimetallic Pd Based Catalysts and Their Advanced Catalysis								ACS CATALYSIS				10	22			13560	13583		10.1021/acscatal.0c03280				NOV 20 2020	2020	Bimetallic Pd based catalysts have received tremendous research interests for many important reactions in fields of important petrochemical industrial process, fine chemical synthesis, environment protection, renewable energy conversion, as their specific activity and selectivity are usually higher than that of pure Pd. With a well-defined composition, Pd-M bimetallic catalysts are also the ideal platform for the investigation of the reaction mechanism, which provides a bridge for the construction of high-performance catalyst. This Review intends to give an overview of the recent advances on the design principles of bimetallic Pd based catalyst in term of active sites' structure and number, and provide insights into the synergy effects between Pd and M as well as the supports to understand the elementary mechanisms of reactions. The Review starts with how the intrinsic activity and selectivity of different structures (alloy, core-shell, and Pd/metal compound interface) would be controlled by ligand effect, strain effect, ensemble effect, and support effect; followed by a discussion of the structure determined mechanism investigation in reactions of selective hydrogenation, CO oxidation, methane combustion, electrocatalytic energy conversion (HER, ORR, MOR), CO2 reduction, H-2 production, biomass upgrading, and fine chemical synthesis; and then introduces the strategies for how to maximize the active sites' number in a finite metal load. Finally, the operando insight into the active sites' reconstruction under reaction condition will be discussed. On the basis of this Review, the experience and generic rules acquired from the design thoughts, synthetic disciplines, and the functionalities of bimetallic Pd based catalysts in a given reaction could have an important referential significance for revealing catalytic mechanisms at the molecular scales as well as building up other high-efficiency bimetallic catalysts.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900041

To understand the different oxygenation patterns by members of the long-UPO and short-UPO subfamilies, the latter represented by the Marasmius rotula enzyme (MroUPO), fatty-acid diffusion into their heme pockets was simulated with the adaptive PELE software. Computational results shed light on the inability of AaeUPO to epoxidize oleic acid (C18:1), opposed to MroUPO, due to steric hindrances to harbor (with a good interaction energy) the substrate with the Delta 9 C-10 atom at a catalytically relevant distance (<3.5 angstrom) from the oxo group in simulated heme compound-I. However, effective a-linolenic acid epoxidation is anticipated because the Delta 15 C-16 atom would attain such a distance in AaeUPO thanks to its more terminal position. The above hypothesis was verified using an engineered MroUPO variant (I153F/S156F) with a narrowed heme access channel mimicking that of AaeUPO. Experimental oxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids by this variant thus resembles that of AaeUPO, including regioselective (from 95% to >99%) formation of cis,cis-15,16-epoxyoctadeca-9,12-dienoic acid. The nearly complete conversion of alpha-linolenic acid by the two enzymes was transferred to a small preparative scale, the yield of purified product was estimated, its chemical structure analyzed by NMR, and more interestingly, stereoselective production of the 15(R),16(S) enantiomer (80-83% ee) assessed by chiral HPLC. This enzymatic synthesis overcomes the unspecificity of chemical epoxidation where the reaction cannot be restricted to the formation of monoepoxides as found during m-perchlorobenzoic acid oxidation of a-linolenic acid. Moreover, the variant was able to produce the unsaturated dicarboxylic fatty acid, together with subterminal oxygenation products, during partial conversion of oleic acid. These two noteworthy reactions had not been reported for any UPO described to date.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900042

However, the factors affecting an enzyme's processivity are not fully understood, as processivity in a solid-liquid interface can be hardly determined biochemically. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), here we investigated an insect chitinase cocktail containing one exochitinase (OfChi-h) and two endochitinases (OfChtI and OfChtII), the indispensable enzymes for shedding old cuticle. At the single-molecule level, we have revealed endochitinases as a significant factor to elevate the processivity of OfChi-h from 25 to 176 reactions in crystalline chitin hydrolysis, to dramatically increase the number of OfChi-h newly bound onto a chitin surface area unit per chitinase concentration, and to increase the duration time of processive running OfChi-h molecules on the chitin surface (1/k(off)) from 0.48 to 3.13 s. In the presence of endochitinases, OfChi-h molecules were observed to crowd at the ends of chitin fibrils and form clusters that quickly ablate chitin fibrils. The processive initiation including initial OfChi-h-substrate binding and complexation is a factor that affects processive hydrolysis. The time for processive initiation was deduced to be 0.22 +/- 0.07 s according to an aligning behavior of OfChi-h molecules on chitin fibrils. This work improves our knowledge of exo-endo chitinase synergism during the solid-liquid interfacial catalysis of crystalline chitin hydrolysis, highlighting the role of endochitinases in boosting processive hydrolysis.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900044

Herein, a hierarchical echinus-like Cu-MFI-AE catalyst was developed, which exhibited a high yield of acetaldehyde and unprecedented stability. The formation of Cu-O-Si on the interface of Cu and hierarchical MFI avoids the aggregation of Cu nanoparticles and stabilizes the Cu+ species. The Cu+ and Cu-0 species perform a synergetic mechanism, with Cu+ involving into acetaldehyde generation and Cu-0 serving as H-2 liberation sites. The utilization of interfacial interactions is an effective method in stabilizing metal nanoparticles without affecting the active sites for ethanol conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900046

The product is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of various indole alkaloids, many of which are pharmaceutically important. STRs have relatively broad scopes for both the amine and aldehyde substrates, making them attractive biocatalyst candidates for applications in organic synthesis. An interesting feature of STR discovered recently is the switched enantiopreference of the reaction using short-chain aliphatic aldehydes in comparison to the natural secologanin substrate. Herein, we use quantum chemical calculations to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism and the origins of enantioselectivity of STR, considering both natural and non-natural substrates. The calculated overall barrier is in a good agreement with the measured rate constant, and the nature of the rate-determining step is consistent with kinetic isotope effect experiments. Importantly, the enantioselectivity for the reactions of both natural and non-natural substrates are well reproduced. A systematic analysis of energy profiles of the entire reactions and the geometries of the key transition states and intermediates along the pathways leading to the different enantiomers of the products provides a rationalization for the observed inversion of enantioselectivity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900047

The exploitation of Ni-catalyzed direct homocoupling of unprotected 2-haloaniline analogues to produce 2,2'-diaminobiaryls with a readily available and inexpensive bipyridine ligand has been described. This approach was highlighted by its high chemoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and functional group compatibility. The mechanistic and calculation studies indicated that Ni(0), Ni(I), Ni(II), and Ni(III) species might be involved in the catalytic cycle.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900048

Our time-resolved soft X-ray photoemission spectroscopy results provide evidence of ultrafast timescales and, coupled with theoretical calculations, clarify the mechanism of oxygen activation that is crucial to unraveling the underlying processes for a range of photocatalytic reactions relevant to air purification and self-cleaning surfaces. The reaction takes place between 1.2 and 2.8 (+/- 0.2) ps after irradiation with an ultrashort laser pulse leading to the formation of CO2, prior to which no intermediate species were observed on a picosecond time scale. Our theoretical calculations predict that the presence of intragap unoccupied O-2 levels leads to the formation of a charge-transfer complex. This allows the reaction to be initiated following laser illumination at a photon energy of 1.6 eV (770 nm), taking place via a proposed mechanism involving the direct transfer of electrons from TiO2 to physisorbed O-2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900049

The reaction proceeds by Lewis acid (3 mol % Er(OTf)(3))-catalyzed epoxide isomerization and subsequent cobalt-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation using ammonia borane as the hydrogen source. The general applicability of this methodology is highlighted by the synthesis of 43 alcohols from epoxides. A variety of terminal (23 examples) and 1,2-disubstituted internal epoxides (14 examples) bearing different functional groups are converted to the desired anti-Markovnikov alcohols in excellent selectivity and yields of up to 98%. For selected examples, it is shown that the reaction can be performed on a preparative scale up to 50 mmol. Notably, the isomerization step proceeds via the most stable carbocation. Thus, the regiochemistry is controlled by stereoelectronic effects. As a result, in some cases, rearrangement of the carbon framework is observed when tri- and tetra-substituted epoxides (6 examples) are converted. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions even though aldehydes and ketones are also reduced to the respective alcohols under the reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments were used to investigate the role of the Lewis acid in the reaction. Besides acting as the catalyst for the epoxide isomerization, the Lewis acid was found to facilitate the dehydrogenation of the hydrogen donor, which enhances the rate of the transfer hydrogenation step. These experiments additionally indicate the direct transfer of hydrogen from the amine borane in the reduction step.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900050

In particular, the abundant and nontoxic material hydroxyapatite demonstrates high activity at a low cost when its constituent cations are replaced with transition metals, which also enables its catalytic properties to be tailored. Using this method, the facile and scalable synthesis of a copper-substituted hydroxyapatite catalyst is presented, demonstrating its high activity in the reverse water gas shift reaction. Thorough in situ characterization using X-ray absorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic methods provides unrivaled insight into both the structure of the active catalyst and the speciation of reaction intermediates. It is thus shown that this copper-substituted hydroxyapatite catalyst is an exemplary candidate for use in large-scale carbon dioxide reduction systems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900051

Diverse functionalized carbon radicals (R-F center dot), which are generated through copper(I)-initiated selective halogen atom abstraction via a tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced alpha-amino radical process, undergo regiocontrolled addition to carbon-carbon double bonds. The newly formed carbon radicals combine with Y = CN, N-3, or NCS from TMSY in a copper(I)-promoted process to form a broad spectrum of alpha-cyano-, alpha-azido-, and alpha-thiocyano-beta-substituted products with additional functionalities in R-F in high yields. Conversion of the reaction products to functionalized cyclopropane, amide, amine, triazole, thiol, and tetrazole highlights the potential utility of this method.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900052

We present a thin-film composite electrode with a unique morphology and an ultralow loading of iridium that has extraordinary electrocatalytic properties. This is accomplished by the electrochemical growth of a defined, high-surface-area titanium oxide nanotubular film, followed by the nitridation and effective immobilization of iridium nanoparticles. The applicative relevance of this production process is justified by a high oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) activity and high stability. Enhanced OER performance is due to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). The high durability is achieved by self-passivation of the titanium oxynitride (TiON) surface layer with TiO2, which in addition also effectively embeds the Ir nanoparticles while still keeping them electrically wired. An additional contribution to the enhanced durability comes from the nitrogen atoms, which according to our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reduce the tendency of the Ir nanoparticles to grow. Materials are analyzed by advanced electrochemical characterization techniques. Namely, the entire process of the TiON-Ir electrode's preparation and the electrochemical evaluation can be tracked with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at identical locations. In general, the experimental approach allows for the unique morphological, structural, and compositional insights into the preparation and electrocatalytic performance of thin films, making it useful also outside electrocatalysis applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900053

Herein, we reported the selective production of nitrones under ambient conditions (35 degrees C, 1 atm H-2) via catalytic cascade reactions using supported RuPt nanoparticles (NPs) with finely tuned surface geometric and electronic structures. Under optimized conditions, 94% yield of nitrone was obtained with Ru3Pt1 bimetallic core-shell NPs in the reductive coupling of nitrobenzene and benzaldehyde, while Pt NPs were deactivated after nitrone yield approached 42% and no activity was observed for Ru NPs. The microcalorimetric adsorption measurement and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the strong adsorption of nitrones compared to that of H-2 is the main reason for the deactivation of Pt NPs. The combination of Pt with Ru could increase the surface electronic density of Pt as well as induce Pt isolation by Ru, which, in turn, affects the adsorption strength of nitrone and H-2. Ru3Pt, achieved a high nitrone yield in comparison with other RuPt samples, which is possibly related to the strong adsorption and activation ability toward H-2 and weak adsorption toward nitrone. Our findings open an avenue for a rational design of catalysts for complex cascade reactions via precise tuning of the adsorption strength of reactants and products.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900054

Described herein is an efficient approach for C-H silylation and hydroxymethylation of pyridines and related heterocycles by the combination of silanes or methanol with readily available N-methoxypyridinium ions with a low catalyst loading (2 mol %) under blue light irradiation. The synthetic importance of the developed reactions is demonstrated by the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, quantum yield measurements, and density-functional theory calculations allowed us to understand reaction mechanisms of both photocatalytic reactions.									10	1	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900055

Electrochemical hydrogenation of TL to MCH can achieve energy savings compared with hydrogenation using molecular hydrogen generated separately, and catalyst development to improve the kinetics of electrochemical TL hydrogenation is imperative. Here, we found that using rhodium to modify Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon black (Pt/C) significantly improved the kinetics of electrochemical TL hydro- genation despite rhodium as a single catalyst being less active than platinum. Rhodium was deposited on Pt NPs by reducing Rh3+ ions with molecular hydrogen. By optimizing the CO-stripping conditions, the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of Pt and Rh for Rh-deposited Pt NP-loaded carbon (Rh-x/Pt/C) catalysts were individually determined, and the Rh coverage (theta(Rh)) and the ratio of ECSA of the deposited Rh to the total ECSA (F-Rh) were successfully estimated. theta(Rh) increased with the Rh/Pt mole ratio for Rh-x/Pt/C and then plateaued around 0.20, whereas F-Rh still increased. According to linear sweep voltammograms and Tafel plots, the Rk/Pt/C electrodes exhibited peak hydrogenation activity 2.7 times that of the Pt/C electrode, and addition of H-ads to TL was rate-determining. Increased theta(Rh) facilitated the addition of H-ads generated on Rh to TL adsorbed on Pt at the extended interface between Rh and Pt, leading to increased geometric reduction current density at 0 V vs RHE (j(geo,0)). Plateauing of theta(Rh) was accompanied by plateauing of j(geo,0), attributed to a lack of any further increase in the extent of the interface. In the electrochemical hydrogen pump hydrogenation of 30 vol % TL with the Rh-x/Pt/C electrodes, MCH was the sole TL hydrogenation product. After the conversion of TL to MCH exceeded about 85%, the hydrogen evolution reaction became appreciable, occurring significantly later than with the Pt/C electrode.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900056

Efficiently exploiting various scaling relations, this approach draws its predictive character from reliable adsorption energies, typically calculated with density-functional theory (DFT). In prevalent screening approaches, the concomitant computational costs are kept tractable through the use of reductionist microkinetic models that only resolve a minimalistic amount of active site motifs at the catalyst surface. Her; we scrutinize this common practice by systematically comparing the screening predictions for the CO methanation reaction when using microkinetic models that resolve an increasing amount of sites, up to the full consideration of all high-symmetry sites at stepped transition metal (TM) and binary TM alloy catalysts. Apart from generally overestimating the catalytic activity, the simplified models fail to identify a most promising class of layered bimetallic alloys as their insufficient representation of the catalyst surface does not allow them to correctly capture the rate-determining step. Only the full microkinetic model provides this proper mechanistic basis for the screening. The excessive amount of predictive-quality adsorption energetics required for this model is obtained from a compressed sensing descriptor that once trained readily provides these data for a new material from a single DFT calculation of the clean surface. With the current methodological advances in areas such as compressed sensing and machine learning, and the concurrent availability of cheap adsorption energetics for a wide range of possible catalyst materials, there is thus no reason to continue to use simplistic microkinetic models in computational catalyst screening.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900057

Transient, high-energy diradical species are typically involved in this type of reaction as key intermediates. Herein, we report the visible-light-induced divergent dearomatization of indole-tethered O-methyl oximes, in which the reactions of the open-shelled singlet diradical intermediates toward competitive [2 + 2] cycloaddition or 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer can be achieved with exclusive selectivity. The mechanism has been well supported by a series of experimental and computational investigations. The dearomatization reactions allow the facile synthesis of structurally appealing indoline-fused azetidines and related polycyclic molecules with high efficiency.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900025

In a large number of these cases, this moiety bears stereochemistry with the stereochemical identity having important consequences on numerous molecular properties, such as the potency of the compound. Yet, the majority of stereoselective syntheses of alpha-CF3 amines rely on diastereoselective couplings with chiral reagents. Concurrent with the rapid expansion of fluorine into pharmaceuticals has been the development of catalytic enantioselective means of preparing alpha-trifluoromethyl amines. In this work, we outline the strategies that have been employed for accessing these enantioenriched amines, including normal polarity approaches and several recent developments in imine umpolung transformations.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900015	34306806

Using multiscale simulation methods, we have characterized the interactions established by a peptidic substrate in the active site, and then we have explored the free energy landscape associated with the acylation and deacylation steps of the proteolysis reaction, characterizing the transition states of the process. Our mechanistic proposals can explain most of the experimental observations made on the highly similar ortholog protease of SARS-CoV. We point to some key interactions that may facilitate the acylation process and thus can be crucial in the design of more specific and efficient inhibitors of the main protease activity. In particular, from our results, the P1' residue can be a key factor to improve the thermodynamics and kinetics of the inhibition process.									27	0	0	0	6	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900017	34192089

Even though the cobalt catalyst is able to activate the C(sp(2))-CN bond alone, the use of the AlMe3 Lewis acid enhances the reactivity of benzonitriles and improves the cross-selectivity with barely any influence on the functional group compatibility. X-ray structure determination of an original low-valent cobalt species combined with catalytic and stoichiometric reactions reveals a catalytically active cobalt(I) species toward the aryl halide partner. On the other hand, experimental insights, including cyclic voltammetry experiments, suggest the involvement of a cobalt complex of a lower oxidation state to activate the benzonitrile derivative. Finally, density functional theory calculations support the proposed mechanistic cycle involving two low-valent cobalt species of different oxidation states to perform the reaction.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900041

However, the current access to enantiopure Ugi's amine is quite tedious and relies heavily on optical resolution, which impedes its practical applications, to some extent. Herein, we present a facile asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched Ugi-type amines bearing a long-carbon chain through Ir-catalyzed cascade allylation/2-aza-Cope rearrangement, followed by amino exchange and Pd/C-catalyzed one-pot hydrogenation/reductive amination. The protocol could be readily scaled up, and it has been conducted in 20-g-scale asymmetric synthesis of (S)-Ugi-type amine from commercially available reagents, in >99% ee and >70% overall yield in four steps with one short silica gel-plug purification. (S,R-p)-PPFA-type and (S,R-p)-Josiphos-type ligands, readily prepared from the achieved Ugi-type amine, exhibited higher or comparable asymmetric induction and catalytic efficacy in several Cu(I)-catalyzed asymmetric reactions, which indicated great potential of the applications of the readily accessible Ugi-type amines in ligand/catalyst design.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900052

The use of a Cu(I) catalyst in combination with a modified 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene (dppbz) ligand enables regioselective hydroboration of various trisubstituted benzylidenecyclobutanes and carbo/heterocyclic analogs. The reaction conditions are mild, and the method tolerates a wide range of medicinally relevant heteroarenes. The protocol can be conveniently conducted on a gram scale, and the tertiary boronic ester products undergo facile diversification into valuable targets. Reaction kinetics and computational studies indicate that the migratory insertion step is turnover-limiting and accelerated by electron-withdrawing groups on the dppbz ligand. Energy decomposition analysis calculations reveal that electron-deficient P-aryl groups on the dppbz ligand enhance the T-shaped pi/pi interactions with the substrate and stabilize the migratory insertion transition state.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900064	33791144

Their cross-coupling for the synthesis of useful isolable ketenimines remains an unsolved challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report a general method for the preparation of ketenimines via a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of easily accessible diazo compounds with isocyanides. The reaction benefits from the use of readily available starting materials, a wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and a high yield in products, and the resultant ketenimines are amenable to further functionalization. Experimental findings and DFT calculations unambiguously corroborate the initial formation of a Pd(II)-isocyanide complex as the active catalytic species, which enables the cross-coupling reaction via a migratory insertion of Pd(II)-carbene into isocyanide, with evidence suggesting that the oxidation state of Pd(II) remains unchanged during the reaction.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900046

However, for enhancing catalytic activity, suitably engineering the LCAs in catalysts through rational design remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrated self-supporting NiO/Co3O4 hybrids for advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Contributed to an abundance of heterointerfaces and increased oxygen vacancies at the interfaces, the numerous LCAs were generated in NiO/Co3O4. Consequently, the NiO/Co3O4 heterostructures exhibited an overpotential of only 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1). By employing density functional theory calculations, it was determined that the d electrons were effectively regulated. Moreover, the d-band centers of Co near the interface in NiO/Co3O4 were far from the Fermi level, thereby confirming the reduction of the unfavorable strong adsorption to oxo intermediates during the OER process. This study provides an effective approach for the rational construction of hybrid interfaces.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900005

Mechanistic studies indicate that the Ni catalyst activates the aryl halide, while the Co cocatalyst activates the alkyl halide. This allows the system to be rationally optimized for a variety of substrate classes by simply modifying the loadings of the Ni and Co catalysts based on the reaction product profile. For example, the coupling of aryl bromides and aryl iodides with alkyl bromides, alkyl iodides, and benzyl chlorides is demonstrated using the same Ni and Co catalysts under similar reaction conditions but with different optimal catalyst loadings in each case. Our system is tolerant of numerous functional groups and is capable of coupling heteroaryl halides, di-ortho-substituted aryl halides, pharmaceutically relevant druglike aryl halides, and a diverse range of alkyl halides. Additionally, the dual catalytic platform facilitates a series of selective one-pot three-component cross-electrophile coupling reactions of bromo(iodo)arenes with two distinct alkyl halides. This demonstrates the unique level of control that the platform provides and enables the rapid generation of molecular complexity. The system can be readily utilized for a wide range of applications as all reaction components are commercially available, the reaction is scalable, and toxic amide-based solvents are not required. It is anticipated that this strategy, as well as the underlying mechanistic framework, will be generalizable to other cross-electrophile coupling reactions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900028	33628617

The characterization results revealed that hydrogen spillover existed in NiMo and CoMo catalysts, and decreasing Ni/Mo and Co/Mo ratios could reduce hydrogen spillover. Meanwhile, the naphthalene hydrocracking behaviors over different catalysts were investigated and compared. The higher yield of cyclane for CoMo/AY catalysts demonstrated that hydrogen spillover could deeply hydrogenate naphthalene into cyclane. The combined catalysts Ni/Y@CoMo/A, Ni/Y@NiMo/A, and Ni/Y@Mo/A showed relatively lower conversions of naphthalene but higher yields of valued <C10 aromatics. The combined catalyst Ni/Y@CoMo/A presented the highest yield of light aromatics due to the appropriate reduction of hydrogen spillover and rational utilization of hydroreaction characteristics for different active metals. Moreover, the stability of the CoMo catalyst was higher than that of the NiMo catalyst. The catalysts containing Co and Mo active metals presented a low content of carbon deposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900001

Iridium in complexes bonded to weak and moderate electron-donor supports, SiO2 and gamma-Al2O3, underwent aggregation, forming nanoparticles and clusters, respectively. When the support was a strong electron-donor (MgO), iridium remained site-isolated. Density functional theory calculations confirm the dependence of iridium-support bond strength on the support's electron-donor character. Coating the SiO2-supported complexes with 1-n-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate enhanced electron density on the iridium, hindering its aggregation. These results demonstrate opportunities for stabilizing atomically dispersed supported noble metals under reducing conditions by choice of support/ionic liquid sheath combinations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900002

The speciation of mono- and polymetallic complexes involving alkylaluminum and the cationizing agent has been achieved. Their dormant or active character has been revealed. This speciation shows a thermodynamically favorable transmetalation reaction between the aryl group of [B(C6F5)(4)](-) and the alkyl group of AlR3. The reactivity of [(2-Me-Ind)(Et)M](+) (M = Gd, Sc) toward monomer insertions is detailed. Computed energy profiles demonstrate the preference for cis-1,4 over trans-1,4 insertion.

However, the mechanism of product selectivity control is far from being understood. Herein, we studied the role of acidity on the product selectivity by taking SAPO-18 as an example and physically mixing it with ZnCrOx because its Si/Al ratio can be varied in a relatively wide range. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of the product selectivity on the Si/Al ratio. Light olefin selectivity reaches as high as 81.6% with CO conversion 35.5% at Si/Al ratio = 0.011. A higher Si/Al ratio gives a stronger acid strength and higher acid density, which leads to a reduced ratio of olefins/paraffins (O/P) and an increased C-3/C-2 ratio in the products. This could be attributed to the enhanced secondary reactions of ethylene under a H-2-rich atmosphere of syngas conversion.

The effect of calcination temperature and Cu loading on Cu-CeO2 catalysts was studied by the combination of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy, H-2-temperature program reduction (H-2-TPR), ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Cu atoms were found to incorporate into the ceria lattice in air at below 500 degrees C, leading to the formation of a bulk CuyCe1-yO2-x solid solution. As the calcination temperature was raised to 800 degrees C, the solubility of Cu ions in bulk ceria was reduced sharply. Surface segregation of Cu atoms led to the formation of CuOx and a surface Cu-doped ceria thin layer, resulting in a much enhanced activity for CO oxidation. Moreover, the activities of calcined Cu-CeO2 catalysts did not increase with the Cu loading but exhibited an optimal activity at similar to 2 wt % of Cu loading, where segregated CuOx species gave an average size in the sub-nanometer (sub-nm) range. Larger CuOx nanoparticles (NPs) on the Cu-doped ceria thin layer exhibited a lower activity toward CO oxidation. We believe the enhanced catalytic properties of the thermally aged Cu-CeO2 catalysts are attributed to the formation of an interface between sub-nm CuOx and the Cu-doped ceria thin layer. Our study thus sheds light on the nature of most active sites on Cu/CeO2 catalysts and facilitates the rational design of ceria-supported metal catalysts for oxidation reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900006

To further enhance its efficiency, both random mutagenesis and structure-guided evolution were performed. Variant M4 (D187N/A200N/S207A/R211G) showed a 43-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m = 1135.0 min(-1) mM(-1)) and a 21-fold reduction in K-m value (0.4 mM) compared with WT. Crystal structures of beneficial variants were resolved to clarify the evolutionary changes underlying improvements to catalytic efficiency. Structure alignment with WT indicated that loop 200-207 may play an important role in modulating access to the substrate entrance tunnel. Furthermore, MD simulations of WT-3a and M4-3a interactions illustrated that M4-3a has a better angle for nucleophilic attack and more readily enters a prereaction state. Additional hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were observed in prereaction states of M4-3a compared with that of WT-3a, consistent with its decreased K-m value. In a hydantoinase process, the complete conversion of 160 mM L-indolylmethylhydantoin was achieved by M4 in a 0.5 L reaction, with D-tryptophan yield of 99.3% and productivity of 64.9 g L-1 d(-1). This study reveals a key loop at the substrate tunnel of D-carbamoylase and provides an effective strategy for engineering D-carbamoylase and other carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family enzymes.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900007

The catalyst is a Cu film sputtered onto the surface of a PTFE membrane, through which the products of CO2 reduction are sampled for analysis by differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS). To avoid changes in the catalyst morphology, the cathode potential is set at -0.8 V vs RHE and -1.15 V vs RHE. We find that the faradaic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) minimizes and that for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) maximizes when the durations at each potential are 10 s. Under these conditions, the FE for the HER decreases to 11%, relative to 22% for static electrolysis, at -1.15 V vs RHE, and the FE for the CO2RR increases to 89%, relative to 78% for static electrolysis. Pulsed electrolysis also increases the FE for C2+ products from 68% for static electrolysis to 81%. Temporal analysis of the products by DEMS reveals that while the variation in product concentrations near the cathode begins in synchrony at the start of pulsed electrolysis, the concentration of C2H4 increases and those of CO and H-2 decrease with extended time. We attribute these trends to an increase in the ratio of adsorbed CO to H on the catalyst surface. Simulation of pulsed electrolysis also shows that during the period when the cathode is at -0.8 V vs RHE, the local concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte near the cathode builds up. This inventory then allows electrolysis during the period at -1.15 V vs RHE to occur with a higher CO2 concentration than could be achieved for static electrolysis. The net effect of alternating cathode potentials is to enhance the local concentration of CO2, which favors the progress of the CO2RR relative to the HER and in particular the formation of C2+ products.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900008

Mechanistic studies showed that the role of Sc(OTf)(3) in the reaction is to activate reagent 1 via Lewis acid-Lewis base interaction to form complex [Sc(OTf)(3)center dot 3(1)], which was fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the reduction potential of complex [Sc(OTf)(3)center dot 3(1)] is much higher than that of reagent 1, thus suggesting complex [Sc(OTf)(3)center dot 3(1)] is much easier to accept electron through single-electron-transfer (SET) process, and consequently, much easier to generate trifluoromethyl radical.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900009

It was observed by postcatalysis solid-state NMR that silica-tethered [(equivalent to SiO-(POCOP)-P-tBu4)Ir(C2H4)] (3-C2H4) was converted fully to [(equivalent to SiO-(POCOP)-P-tBu4)Ir(CO)] (3-CO) at 300 degrees C. In this work, the characterization of species under dehydrogenation reaction conditions far from equilibrium between butane and butenes (approach to equilibrium Q/K-eq = 0.3 at 300 degrees C) is performed with operando Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier-Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to show the kinetics of species conversion from 3-C2H4 to 3-CO. It is further found that [( SiO-(POCOP)-P-tBu4)IrHCl] (3-HCl), a species considered to be a precatalyst for alkane dehydrogenation, is also fully converted to 3-CO. A mechanism of decomposition is proposed that implicates surface silanol groups, while carbon monoxide acts as a "stabilizer" for the catalyst by promoting their reductive elimination and maintaining the complex in the I oxidation state.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900010

The heterogeneous catalytic oxidation route using supported Au as a catalyst in this crucial reaction has attracted considerable attention. However, targeted activation of the secondary O-H bond and satisfactory catalytic efficacy remain considerable challenges. This work reports layered double hydroxide (LDH) supported Au catalysts for the targeted activation of the secondary O-H bond and provides deep insights into the active sites and the roles of the LDH support in glycerol selective oxidation. By virtue of the tailorable chemical composition of the LDH brucite-like layer, Zn2Fe-, Co2Al-, Zn2Al-, Zn2Ga-, and Mg2Al-LDHs, displaying varied surface basic densities and hydroxyl vacancies (V-OH), were applied as supports for Au nanoparticles in this work. A glycerol conversion of 72.9 +/- 0.2% and a dihydroxyacetone selectivity of 63.8 +/- 0.2% were achieved on ZnGa-LDH-supported Au. In addition to Au-0, surface Aun+ (Au+ and Au3+) species are abundant in the interfacial M-II-O-Aun(+) linkages. Detailed investigations verify the cooperation between the surface basic sites on the LDH support for the activation of the secondary O-H bonds and the interfacial M-II-O-Au+ sites for the activation of the secondary C-H bonds. Significantly, on Zn-containing LDHs, an additional synergy exists between the surface VOH sites and the interfacial Zn-II-O-Au3+ species to further promote catalytic activity.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900011

However, the theoretical understanding behind this important class of reactions is still quite limited, and how the presence of low-lying high-spin states benefits their reactivities is not well known. In this work, we have performed a detailed density functional theory (DFT) study on a previously reported iron diimine-catalyzed hydrovinylation, which we have found to exhibit an interesting "two-state reactivity." Specifically, we found that despite the fact that the resting state of the reaction was experimentally determined to be a triplet state previously, the rate-determining and product-determining steps are found to preferably proceed at a singlet state. A triplet state is better at stabilizing the intermediates and imposes fewer geometric constraints for the substrate to adjust its conformations. A singlet state allows an extra available metal d orbital for interaction with ligand, which facilitates oxidative coupling of diene with an incoming alkene, beta-hydride transfer, and ligand substitution. Through in-depth analysis of the electronic structures, we found that the two-state reactivity phenomenon is due to the interplay between orbital interactions, exchange interactions, and coordination geometry, a conclusion that would also serve as an important step in the pursuit of understanding in the first-row transition-metal catalysis and benefit the future design of catalysis with earth-abundant metals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900012

In this study, we have investigated the reaction mechanism of DRM on La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3-derived catalysts and shown how it differs from that on La0.9Sr0.1NiO3. By using isotopically labeled reactants and in situ DRIFTS analysis, we observe that lanthanum oxycarbonates are active intermediates for CO2 activation and oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates from methane on the La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 catalyst, whereas the oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates occurs solely through a MvK-type redox mechanism by support lattice oxygen in La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3. The catalysts were thoroughly characterized by XRD, H-2-TPR, XAS, XPS, O-2- and CO2-TPD-MS, H-2 chemisorption, TGA-DTA, and TEM, and the catalyst properties were correlated with the proposed reaction mechanism. It was observed that in contrast to La0.9Sr0.1NiO3, which almost completely decomposed to form Ni/La2O3-xSrO after H-2 reduction pretreatment, La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 could partially retain a perovskite structure after reduction and in the DRM atmosphere. Detailed characterization of the La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst after reduction and exposure to reactant gases reveals that this perovskite phase is reversibly decomposed into La2O3 and metal (NiFe) upon exposure to CH4 and is reconstructed upon exposure to CO2 or CH4/CO2 mixture. The cyclic decomposition and formation of the perovskite phase is accompanied by the release and capture of oxygen from and into the perovskite lattice and the redox cycling of Fe between Fe0 (in NiFe alloy) and Fe3+/Fe4+ (in perovskite) states. The La0.9Sr0.1NiO3, on the other hand, forms the lanthanum oxycarbonate phase in CO2 atmosphere, with no observable reconstruction of the perovskite phase. We attribute the reversibility of the formation of the stable La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskite phase under DRM conditions and its high oxygen storage/release capacity as the primary reason for the dominance of the redox mechanism and high coke resistance of La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900013

Catalyst selection plays a critical role in the performance of the RCF process, and noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, and Ru) with a high loading of 5 wt % have been extensively used to obtain high-yield phenolic monomers and delignified holocellulose-rich solids. In this study, we demonstrated that the RCF of biomass over extremely low Pd loaded on N-doped carbon (CNx) support catalysts could produce phenolic monomers at approximately theoretical maximum yield and presented high holocellulose-rich solid recovery. When birch wood was converted over the catalyst with 0.25 wt % Pd loaded on CNx (Pd-0.25/CNx) at 250 degrees C and an initial H-2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 3 h, a lignin-derived phenolic monomer carbon yield and highly delignified holocellulose recovery of 52.7 C % and 84.2 wt %, respectively, were achieved. The Pd-0.25/CNx catalyst contained both ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters and single Pd atoms, which were stabilized on the N-functionalized carbon support. The highly activated hydrogenolysis and double-bond saturation that occurred over the Pd-0.25/CNx catalyst dominantly produced 4-n-propyl guaiacol/syringol. In contrast, 4-n-propanol guaiacol/syringol with residual -OH groups was the major species obtained over the typical 5 wt % Pd/activated carbon catalyst. The plausible reaction pathways for the production of different types of phenolic monomers were discussed using density functional theory calculations. The excellent RCF performance of the Pd-0.25/CNx catalyst was demonstrated using other types of biomass, such as oak, pine, and miscanthus. The successful use of extremely low-Pd-loaded catalysts is advantageous for implementing economically viable RCF techniques.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900014

Therefore, we developed a class of highly regioselective sandwich-type catalysts for the carbonylation of isobutylene oxide. These sterically encumbered complexes install carbon monoxide at the substituted epoxide carbon, generating a high level of contrasteric selectivity (up to >99:1). Further catalyst development improved catalyst solubility and reproducibility while maintaining high regioselectivity. In addition, a dibasic ester solvent extended catalyst lifetimes and suppressed side product formation. This contrasteric carbonylation of isobutylene oxide offers a route to sought-after pivalolactone and, therefore, PPVL.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900016

However, their catalytic efficiency is severely limited by the accompanying hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and fast catalyst deactivation. In order to reveal the origin of these undesired transformations, we study potential reaction routes of HER, catalyst deactivation, and nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR) by density functional theory in combination with microkinetic modeling, using a triphosphino-silyl ligated iron complex as model system. Our results show that the most favorable HER cycle is initiated by H-2 molecules originated from the noncatalytic reaction of acid and reductant reagents, which can coordinate to a vacant binding site of an Fe complex. Thus, H-2 coordination competes with the N-2 coordination step of the desired N2RR catalytic cycle, and the resulting Fe-H-2 complex can be protonated at both hydrogen atoms to release two H-2 molecules. The proposed mechanism, called autocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (aHER), explains all experimentally observed results including catalyst deactivation, as aHER intermediates can be easily converted into thermodynamically stable, catalytically inactive monohydrides. Our results suggest that improved efficacy of synthetic Fe nitrogenases can be achieved by several ways: (i) proper ligand modifications hindering the formation of Fe-H-2 complexes, (ii) suppressing the noncatalytic H-2 formation in the catalytic mixture by different reagent choice, and (iii) using flow or semiflow reactor setup instead of batch reactors and keep the proton and electron reagent excess low.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900018

Herein, atomically dispersed Ni sites have been rationally anchored in nitrogen-doped carbon sheets (Ni-N-4/NC), which could act as an integrated, active, and anticoking catalyst for methanol dehydrogenation with a high selectivity toward hydrogen and CO under 15 h(-1) (weight hourly space velocities, WHSV) in a fixed-bed reactor. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the electronic structures of Ni-N-4 sites promote the desorption of deep dehydrogenation product ethylene to release the Ni active centers, simultaneously giving a remarkably high H-2 yield rate (1800 mol H-2 mol(-1) Ni h(-1)) and a high anticoking performance even under critical conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900019

In this contribution, we identify two pH-dependent active oxides by mapping the reduction behavior of gold oxide and by in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. It was found that alpha-oxide is preferentially formed in an acidic solution, whereas beta-oxide, Au(OH)(3), is preferably formed in an alkaline solution. In line with the presence of two different surface structures on gold, there are two OER mechanisms: one mechanism wherein water splitting occurs via proton-coupled electron-transfer steps mediated by alpha-oxide and the other mechanism wherein electron transfer and proton transfer are decoupled and mediated by a deprotonated form of Au(OH)(3). This identification of pH-dependent oxides offers a different perspective in our understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides in a full pH scale range.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900021

Mechanistic studies are consistent with a two-step activation mechanism, where oxidation of thioethers to their corresponding sulfide radical cations by an acridinium photoredox catalyst is followed with deprotonation by trifluoroacetate to generate alpha-thio alkyl radicals and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experimental studies support the involvement of TFA in all subsequent steps leading to product formation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900022

However, there have been only a few structural motifs known to efficiently catalyze the acyl-transfer reaction. Herein, we introduce a different acyl-transfer catalytic paradigm based on the tropolone framework. We show that tropolonate salts, due to their strong nucleophilicity and photochemical activity, can promote the coupling reaction between alcohols and carboxylic acid anhydrides or chlorides to give products under thermal or blue light photochemical conditions. Kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations suggest interesting mechanistic insights for reactions promoted by this acyl-transfer catalytic system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900023

A Universal Descriptor for the Screening of Electrode Materials for Multiple-Electron Processes: Beyond the Thermodynamic Overpotential								ACS CATALYSIS				10	21			12607	12617		10.1021/acscatal.0c03865				NOV 6 2020	2020	On the way toward a sustainable energy economy, electrode materials that do not contain scarce noble metals need to be developed. Operating at low computational costs, material screening is a powerful tool to assess the performance of potential electrode compositions by categorizing materials into active and inactive. Most commonly, linear scaling relationships are analyzed by the construction of a volcano plot, in which the thermodynamic overpotential, eta(TD), serves as activity descriptor. Even if this descriptor identifies the majority of active electrode materials, it has been reported that eta(TD) lacks thorough sorting of catalysts according to their activity. This failure is mainly related to the fact that eta(TD) is defined by a single free-energy change (thermodynamics), whereas the applied overpotential and kinetics are not factored in the analysis. Based on the discussion of free-energy diagrams and the rate-determining reaction step, this Viewpoint introduces an alternate activity descriptor, G(max)(eta), for multiple-electron processes, thereby including the applied overpotential and kinetic effects in the evaluation. On the example of the oxygen evolution reaction, the application of G(max)(eta) for the screening and optimization of electrode materials is discussed, providing a different perspective compared with the conventional scheme of eta(TD).									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900024

This increasing level of detail can even result detrimental when drawing conclusions from the computed mechanism, as many coexisting reaction pathways can be in close competence. Here, we present a reaction network-based implementation of the energy span model in the form of a computational code, gTOFfee, capable of dealing with any user-specified reaction network. This approach, compared to microkinetic simulations, enables a much easier, simpler, and straightforward analysis of the performance of any catalytic reaction network. In this communication, we will go through the foundations and applicability of the underlying model and will tackle the application to two relevant catalytic systems: homogeneous Co-mediated propene hydroformylation and heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation over Cu(111).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900026

However, unproductive reactivity from fast deactivation of the photoexcited complexes through back electron transfer has slowed the development of EDA complexes in synthetic methodology. Here, we disclose the study of EDA complexes derived from 2-methoxynaphthalene donor and acylated ethyl isonicotinate N-oxide acceptor that undergo a fast N-O bond fragmentation event upon photoexcitation. This reaction design not only overcomes the limitations of back electron transfer but also enables regeneration of the donor species, representing a rare example of EDA photochemistry in a catalytic regime. The synthetic utility is demonstrated through visible light-driven radical trifluoromethylation and Minisci alkylation reactions. The scalability of the EDA complex-promoted reaction is evidenced by the successful multigram-scale trifluoromethylation of methyl N-Boc pyrrole-2-carboxylate in a continuous flow manifold.									13	1	0	0	3	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900027

However, a universal tool for predicting the activities of these materials is still lacking, thus hindering the efficient discovery of nanomaterials as peroxidase mimics. Here, we use density functional theory calculations to reveal the peroxidase-mimetic mechanisms for a series of iron-oxide nanosurfaces, and we derive a volcano-shaped plot of catalytic activity as a function of simple energy-based descriptors. The activity curves and the descriptors can be used to predict peroxidase-like activities for not only iron oxides but also other nanomaterials that share similar catalytic mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the method developed herein can systematically predict the peroxidase-like activities of nanomaterials and thus is expected to be of use for computer-aided design of nanomaterial-based peroxidase mimics.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900029

In this work, dynamic catalysts are defined in the context and history of forced and passive dynamic chemical systems, with the classification of unique catalyst behaviors based on temporally relevant linear scaling parameters. The conditions leading to the catalytic rate and selectivity enhancement are described as modifying the local electronic or steric environment of the active site to independently accelerate sequential elementary steps of an overall catalytic cycle. These concepts are related to physical systems and devices that stimulate a catalyst using light, vibrations, strain, and electronic manipulations including electrocatalysis, back-gating of catalyst surfaces, and introduction of surface electric fields via solid electrolytes and ferroelectrics. These catalytic stimuli are then compared for the capability to improve catalysis across some of the most important chemical challenges for energy, materials, and sustainability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900030

In spite of recent performance achievements through Pt particle downsizing, knowledge of the prototypical Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst operation mechanism, in particular the electronic state and the stability of the Pt phase under reaction conditions, remains limited. We have investigated atomically dispersed Pt/TiO2 catalysts by pre-/postreaction scanning transmission electron microscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy-mass spectrometry under gas-phase ethanol dehydrogenation conditions under ultraviolet-visible light irradiation. The catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method on two types of commercial titania. While the general effect of the reaction on initially fully oxidized (Pt-IV) single-atom catalysts (SACs) is Pt reduction and aggregation, this combined phenomenon can be inhibited in two manners. First, when it is supported on high-surface-area anatase, the Pt SAC retains an intermediate oxidation state, and its clustering is limited to Pt dimers and trimers. Second, with the same support, a mild reducing pretreatment generates, through the formation of Pt-Ti bonds, near-neutral and ultradispersed Pt species (from single atoms to nanometric clusters) with the highest stability and activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900031

Herein, we synthesized nitrogen-containing nanocarbons (NCNs) with a nitrogen content of 27.6 atom % by a photochemical approach. We found that this NCNs structure can act as a catalyst to drive the reduction of CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO). The CO evolution activity over the NCNs reached 34.5 mu mol/30 min (1 mg NCN) with a selectivity of 80.4%. The quantum efficiency over the NCNs was 2.3% at 450 nm irradiation, which is comparable to those of the metal-based catalysts for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The reaction processes of CO2 reduction were investigated by CO2 adsorption, CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Results suggested that the pyridinic nitrogen sites within NCNs were the main active species for CO2 reduction catalysis. Besides, we observed that nanocarbons with oxygen modification can also drive the CO2 reduction reaction. However, the promotion effect of the nitrogen modification on CO2 reduction was better than that of the oxygen modification on CO2 reduction. Additionally, using this photochemical approach, we synthesized different nanocarbons by changing carbon precursors, highlighting the versatility of this approach. This work expands the application of nanocarbon for photosynthetic CO2 conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900032

Operando monitoring and reliable identification of reacting species, however, are challenging tasks because they require surface-molecular sensitive and specific experiments under reaction conditions and sophisticated theoretical calculations. The lack of molecular insight under operating conditions is largely due to the limited availability of operando tools and to date still hinders a quick technological advancement of electrocatalytic devices. Here, we present a combination of advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations considering implicit solvent contributions and time-resolved electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS) to identify short-lived reaction intermediates during the showcase electro-reduction of Au oxide (AuOx) in sulfuric acid over several tens of seconds. The EC-SER spectra provide evidence for temporary Au-OH formation and for the asynchronous adsorption of (bi)sulfate ions at the surface during the reduction process. Spectral intensity fluctuations indicate an OH/(bi)sulfate turnover period of 4 s. As such, the presented EC-SERS potential jump approach combined with implicit solvent DFT simulations allows us to propose a reaction mechanism and prove that short-lived Au-OH intermediates also play an active role during the AuOx electro-reduction in acidic media, implying their potential relevance also for other electrocatalytic systems operating at low pH, like metal corrosion, the oxidation of CO, HCOOH, and other small organic molecules, and the oxygen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900033	33194302

Within this context, C-N bond activation has emerged recently as a powerful strategy for the preparation or utilization of nitrogen-containing compounds, due to the prevalence of C-N bonds in organic compounds. A key challenge in this area is that most C-N bonds are relatively inert, and this makes their activation a difficult task. Since the turn of the millennium the number of published articles regarding C-N bond activation has grown exponentially, providing important improvements in methodologies for such transformations. Indeed, several distinct strategies have been developed to achieve C-N bond activation. The most common have exploited either strain release or quaternization of the nitrogen center, while other state-of-the-art strategies, such as oxidative addition of neutral C-N bonds and the use of directing groups, have also appeared. Despite considerable progress, deeper insight into the mechanisms of activation and improvements in atom economy are still required for the field to advance. In this Perspective we give an overview of key advances in catalytic methodologies where C-N bond activation is achieved by oxidative addition to transition metals.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900035

However, controlling the coupling selectivity (homo- vs cross-coupling) and the chemo- (C-C vs C-O) and regioselectivity in the reaction of two distinct enolizable substrates under aerobic conditions is notoriously challenging. Here, we present a regiodivergent oxidative cross-coupling reaction between catechols and carbonyl compounds (2-oxindoles and benzofuranones). The oxidative cross-coupling proceeds at the C(6) position of 4-substituted catechols under catalyst-free conditions, while the Pd(II)-BINAP-mu-hydroxo catalyst promotes the reaction at the C(5) position. A series of mechanistic control experiments support a homolytic aromatic substitution mechanism for the carbon-carbon bond-forming processes in both the C(6)- and C(5)selective coupling reactions. Furthermore, computational analyses suggest that Pd(II)-catecholate is a key catalytic active species, which serves as a SOMO-phile, to facilitate the endothermic C(5)-selective carbon-carbon bond formation and the exothermic aerobic oxidative aromatization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900037

However, widespread application is hampered by the inherent difficulty in suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction and controlling the overall process selectivity. Further critical parameters are the limited solubility of CO2 in many electrolytes and its hindered mass transport to the electrodes. Herein we report on a series of nanoparticle Cu electrocatalysts on different carbon supports and their potential to perform the electrochemical CO2 reduction under supercritical conditions (scCO(2)). Herein, CO2 serves as the reaction medium and reactant alike. By a detailed comparison to ambient conditions we show that scCO(2) conditions largely suppress the undesirable hydrogen evolution and favor the production of formic acid by the Cu electrodes. Furthermore, we show that scCO(2) conditions significantly prevent Cu nanoparticle agglomeration during electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900038

These factors include competitive adsorption, molecular structure, and electron polarization of the two ketones on the catalyst surface. Kinetic analysis shows that on MgO, self-condensation of both ACE and CPO is limited by the initial unimolecular enolization step. Accordingly, CPO exhibits a higher self-condensation rate than ACE due to the more favorable alpha-C-H abstraction by the basic O site. The thermodynamic parameters derived from the kinetic analysis indicate that under cross-condensation reaction conditions, the MgO surface fraction covered by CPO is significantly higher than that covered by ACE. Therefore, the product distribution is dominated by [CPO]-activated products ([CPO]CPO + [CPO]ACE). Also, for a given enolate (indicated as [CPO] or [ACE]), the higher surface coverage of CPO leads to enhanced C-C coupling with CPO as the electrophile ([CPO]CPO > [CPO]ACE; [ACE]CPO > [ACE]ACE). By contrast, for both acid catalysts investigated, the rate-limiting step is the bimolecular C-C coupling, with aspects of this step depending on the density of acid sites. That is, on the high-acid-density MCM-41-SO3H catalyst, condensation follows a bimolecular dual-site mechanism (Langmuir-Hinshelwood model). On this catalyst surface, the ACE coverage is higher than that of CPO, which causes a higher selectivity for those products in which ACE is the electrophile ([CPO]ACE > [CPO]CPO; [ACE]ACE > [ACE]CPO). Steric hindrance is another factor that affects selectivity in the same way, favoring products in which the electrophile is ACE since it presents a lower steric hindrance to C-C coupling than CPO. Therefore, the same sequence of products is obtained for the low-acid-density MCM-41-SO3H catalyst, which proceeds on a single-acid site with the other molecule in the liquid phase (Eley-Rideal model). In this case, the electrophile coverage is not relevant, but the steric hindrance is, yielding the same trend as above ([CPO]ACE > [CPO]CPO; [ACE]ACE > [ACE]CPO).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900039

The complexing of exchanged metal ions with H2O or NO, is of particular relevance for a number of reactions, including the ubiquitous presence of both gases in pollution remediation technologies. Here, we interrogate the molecular structure of Pd cations in SSZ-13 zeolites and their interaction with H2O and NO using experimental and computational analyses. Density functional theory (DFT) and spectro-scopic characterization establish that Pd cations preferentially populate two Al (2Al) sites in the six-membered ring as PdII. In situ spectroscopic and kinetic analyses follow the Pd coordination environment and reactivity as a function of environmental conditions, and molecular structures are rationalized through ab initio molecular dynamics and first-principles thermodynamic modeling. Experiment and computational modeling together reveal that, at temperatures <573 K, Pd ions are solvated and mobilized by H2O molecules, promoting catalytic CO oxidation, and form molecular complexes akin to their Pd homogeneous analogues. Exposure to NO promotes transformation from 2Al -> 1Al charge-compensated H2O-solvated Pd-nitrosyl complexes, which desorb NO at higher temperatures and inhibit CO adsorption and oxidation. A comparison with Pd-BEA and Pd-ZSM-5 zeolites demonstrates a heterogeneous distribution of Pd-NO complexes under dry conditions that coalesce into homogeneous H2O-solvated Pd-nitrosyl complexes upon exposure to H2O.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900040

Herein, CO poisoning in CO2 hydrogenation over supported ruthenium (Ru) catalysts in a nonthermal plasma (NTP)-catalysis system was investigated by a combined kinetic and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (DRIFTS-MS) study and compared with the thermal catalytic system. The relevant findings suggest the coexistence of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal mechanisms in the NTP-catalysis. Importantly, comparative study of CO poisoning of the Ru catalyst was performed under the thermal and NTP conditions, showing the advantage of the hybrid NTP-catalysis system over the thermal counterpart to mitigate CO poisoning of the catalyst. Specifically, compared with the CO poisoning in thermal catalysis due to strong CO adsorption and associated metal sintering, in situ DRIFTS-MS analysis revealed that the collisions of reactive plasma-derived species in NTP-catalysis could remove the strongly adsorbed carbon species to recover the active sites for CO2 activation. Thus, the NTP-catalysis was capable of preventing CO poisoning of the Ru catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation. Additionally, under the NTP conditions, the NTP-enabled water-gas shift reaction of CO with H2O (which was produced by CO/CO2 hydrogenation) shifted the equilibrium of CO2 hydrogenation toward CH4 production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900042

Via density functional theory calculations and the computational hydrogen electrode model, we systematically examine the prospect of using a single-transition-metal (TM)-atom-doped graphene-like GaN (g-GaN) monolayer as an electrocatalyst for artificial nitrogen reduction. Among 15 TMs investigated, the Mo-doped g-GaN (Mo@g-GaN) monolayer is the only electrocatalyst predicted to be feasible for the NRR. The Mo@g-GaN monolayer satisfies all screening criteria considered for activating the inert N equivalent to N triple bond effectively, including stabilization of the adsorbed (*) NRR intermediate *NNH and destabilization of the *NH2 species. This monolayer also possesses sufficient overall stability. A complete analysis of the likely mechanisms involved in the NRR on this catalyst suggests that the Mo@g-GaN monolayer could exhibit promising NRR catalytic activity. It achieves this via one specific (distal) pathway, which has a very low onset potential of -0.33 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), corresponding to a low overpotential of 0.42 V vs the RHE, defined using the measured equilibrium potential for NRR of 0.09 V vs the RHE. The potential-determining step, conversion of *NH2 to *NH3, also exhibits a surmountable barrier of 0.42 eV, suggesting kinetics will be facile. Finally, the Mo@g-GaN monolayer is predicted to exhibit substantial selectivity (similar to 31%) toward ammonia synthesis over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings may open a potential route for artificial ammonia synthesis using a single-atom catalyst under ambient conditions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900043

Despite its industrial relevance, the kinetic origin of the high catalytic activity remains under debate. The present report discusses a reaction mechanism of HER on Ni-Mo catalysts by combining experimental and theoretical studies. In contrast to a Ni catalyst, a Ni-Mo catalyst is insensitive to CO gas introduced during HER. In situ spectroscopic measurements including Raman spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) show that Mo3+ prevails during HER catalysis. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations corroborate the thermodynamic stability and HER activity of Mo3+-containing centers on Ni(111) at HER potentials. Notably, Ni is demonstrated to play no direct role as a catalytic site but to effectively disperse and activate the oxidized catalytic Mo species. The results illustrate how to improve the electrocatalytic activity for alkaline HER.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900044

In this work, the prospect for electric field toward controlling product selectivity and reaction networks on the Pt(111) surface was evaluated with periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations in concert with machine learning (ML) algorithms. Linear scaling relationships (LSRs) for adsorption energies of surface species in the electric field were shown to (i) be distinct as compared to zero-field LSRs across metals and (ii) linearly correlate with adsorption energies of H* rather than the binding element. The slope of LSRs linearly correlated with the zero-field dipole moment. A random forest ML additive regression algorithm predicted field-dependent adsorption energies with a mean absolute error (0.09 eV) comparable to DFT. LSRs relating activation energies and reaction energies for dissociation reactions were shown to be distinct as compared to corresponding zero-field Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationships capturing periodic trends. The slopes of the field-dependent LSRs were found to be dependent on the zero-field dipole moment and polarizabilities of the initial, transition, and final states for the reaction. Overall, this study identifies the path forward for electric-field-assisted catalysis, specifically toward catalyst poisoning, product selectivity, and control of reaction pathways.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900045

Steam plays a pivotal role in ZnFe2O4-catalyzed 1-butene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). However, the essential effect of steam on this reaction is still unclear. Herein, we describe the structure-performance relationships of ZnFe2O4 in the presence/absence of steam by combined density functional theory and experimental studies. The catalytic performances of ZnFe2O4 under different reaction conditions were investigated. The ZnFe2O4(110) surface properties under reaction conditions and molecular reaction pathways were modeled. Free-energy profiles were calculated. We found that an oxygen-excess ZnFe2O4(110)-O termination, with an extra O atom bridging two Fe cations, is preferred under oxygen-rich conditions. However, both experimental and theoretical approaches indicate that this surface bicoordinated O is not stable at relatively high temperatures in the absence of steam, resulting in the reduction of surface Fe3+ cations to Fe2+ which are inactive in the 1-butene ODH reaction. It was found that steam interacts strongly with the ZnFe2O4(110)-O surface. Steam stabilizes the catalyst surface Fe3+ ions by converting bicoordinated O to more thermally stable hydroxyl groups. Surface hydroxyls are active sites for C-H bond cleavage in the 1-butene ODH reaction in the presence of steam. We propose that the role of steam elucidated here represents a general mode of steam influence in ODH reactions over oxide surfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900047

Despite the indisputable advances, selectivity issues still remain, given the ubiquity of C-H bonds on molecules; thus, several approaches have been developed to tackle this challenge. Among them, the use of a transient directing group has emerged as an effective tool, circumventing the need for extra synthetic steps to install and then cleave a directing group on the molecule. More recently, this strategy has been successfully applied to the even more challenging transition-metal-catalyzed enantioselective C-H bond functionalization. This review will highlight and discuss the main advances made in the use of a chiral transient directing group for the enantioselective functionalization of C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds by transition-metal catalysis.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900048

Pre-exposure temperature-programmed reaction (PE-TPR) experiments were performed in which ethanol was introduced to oxidized or reduced surfaces followed by heating. In particular, sequential PE-TPR experiments were conducted to incrementally and gradually reduce the surface. The products and their ratios were investigated as a function of surface reduction. The data show that acetaldehyde and ethene production is catalyzed with hydrogen abstraction and oxygen abstraction reactions occurring by intermediates in vacancies at various temperatures >400 K. Adsorption of acetaldehyde followed by a temperature-programmed reaction does not produce ethene, indicating that acetaldehyde is not an intermediate to ethene and that the hydrogen and oxygen abstraction from ethanol to ethene are decoupled steps. Further evidence for this mechanistic nuance was obtained using isotopically labeled ethanol (CD3CH2OH), which produces CD3CHO and CD2CH2. The ratio of aldehyde production to alkene production increases with reduction, suggesting that aldehyde is produced from a disproportionation reaction between ethoxy species in adjacent O-vacancies, while ethene is produced from a dehydrogenation reaction with ethoxy species in vacancies without requiring adjacent O-vacancies. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that the more oxygenated product (aldehyde vs ethene) is favored with more vacancies and that the net alcohol conversion is autocatalytic. Density functional theory calculations were able to find the previously unknown disproportionation pathway between ethoxies in adjacent O-vacancies, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations support this interpretation by reproducing experimental selectivities. The activation energies for these pathways are estimated as 132 +/- 10 kJ/mol for the disproportionation reaction (when occurring between ethoxies in adjacent vacancies) and as 148 +/- 11 kJ/mol for the direct dehydrogenation reaction of an ethoxy in a vacancy. Based on these results, a mechanism with operative pathways based on elementary steps in O-vacancies is reported.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900049

Yet it remains elusive for most of the reactions in a full-size range, from a single atom and subnanometer clusters to nanoparticles. Herein, we report complete size dependence of Pt catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability due to coke formation. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the subnanometer-sized clusters and the nanoparticles, respectively. A canyon-shaped size dependence of the propene selectivity was observed with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size. The subnanometer-sized clusters have opposite size dependence of the propene selectivity compared to nanoparticles. Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles possess high propene selectivity. The atomically dispersed platinum centers with a positive charge dramatically enhanced the activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented its deep dehydrogenation. Besides, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions (e.g., C-C cracking), thus improved propylene selectivity and stability. This work demonstrates the promising application of a supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst for highly selective dehydrogenation of propane.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900050

Density functional theory (DFT) predicts that the formation of bulk PdSO4 is unlikely, which explains the lack of X-ray diffraction (XRD) evidence for the PdSO4 phase. Instead, experimental observations support the idea of PdSO4 being formed on PdO as thin films. Our study found PdSO4(110) and PdSO4(111), corresponding to PdO(100) and PdO(101), respectively, to be the most likely surfaces to be found on a poisoned catalyst. On these sulfate surfaces, PdSO4(111) contains coordinatively unsaturated palladium, which enables catalytic activity. The first C-H dissociation of methane on PdSO4(111) was found to be rather accessible with an energy barrier varying between 0.74 and 0.87 eV, values similar to those reported for metallic Pd. However, the presence of hydroxyl groups increases the barrier height. Methane oxidation is also hindered by an exceptionally strong water adsorption of -1.45 eV on the PdSO4(111) surface, which causes site blocking. A significantly strong adsorption energy causes the combination of surface hydroxyl groups to form adsorbed water that is energetically favorable. The results provide a theoretical justification for the observation that SO2-poisoned PdSO4/Al2O3 catalysts produce proper methane conversion under dry conditions but perform poorly under wet feed.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900051

Herein, we report the direct synthesis of amides from aldehydes and imines in a 100% atom-economical manner. The redox-neutral C-N bond-forming process was enabled by the dual catalysis of visible light and an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) at room temperature. This protocol features the unprecedented umpolung of imines to generate N-centered radicals. Mechanistic investigations reveal this reaction undergoes nontrivial radical-radical coupling between an N-centered radical and a C-centered radical to forge a C-N bond.

Herein, by varying the metal loadings of Ru from 0.5 to 4 wt % to regulate the size of Ru on support, the catalytic performances of Ru/TiO2 catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) can be further refined. An improved FTS activity is acquired when metal size increases, while long carbon-chain products (C5+ hydrocarbons) prefer to be generated from the small-sized Ru catalyst. With intensive characterizations, it is indicated that the coating of TiOx on Ru greatly depends on the size of Ru, with the TiOx overlayer being enhanced on small Ru metal particles. This size-dependent metal/support interaction on Ru/TiOx therefore leads to a varied reduction degree of Ru, which possesses an alterable capability toward CHx transformation on Ru. As a result, the small-sized Ru/TiOx catalyst shows a preference toward the chain growth in FTS by suppressing the competitive methanation on Ru/TiOx. Our results demonstrate that the size-dependent metal/support interaction plays an important role on determining the catalytic performance of Ru/TiOx in FTS, and it can be used as an effective method to tune the reactivity of metal nanoparticles in catalytic processes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900054

However, although an important cofactor for the activation of redox enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) suffers from the drawbacks of cost and limited stability. Moreover, the design of an effective NADH regeneration system remains a huge challenge. Here, we report a visible light-driven conjugated microporous polymer DBTS-CMP1 for the heterogeneous photocatalytic regeneration of NADH. Thanks to various improved properties, such as extended visible light absorption, adequate fluorescence lifetime, enhanced wettability, and rapid charge separation and transfer, an NADH regeneration efficiency of 84% in 45 min was achieved with DBTS-CMP1. In addition, the small molecule model compound DBTS-Ph2, which shares similar structural motifs, was also designed to further study the photoinduced electron transfer process. The strong coordination interaction between dibenzo-[b,d]thiophene sulfone and the Rh metal center, as reflected in fluorescence quenching, cyclic voltammetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, plays an essential role in electron transfer from the photocatalyst to the Rh complex, thus endowing DBTS-CMP1 with a high reaction conversion and selectivity (100%) for 1,4-NADH regeneration. Finally, a photobiocatalytic system was constructed by incorporating NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase for the reduction of formaldehyde into methanol. A total amount of 2.23 mM methanol with a turnover number of 2.23 mmol g(-1) was obtained after 95 min in the photobiocatalytic system, indicating the high photostability and biocompatibility of our DBTS-CMP1 photocatalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900055

Herein, the conversion of 1,2,6-hexanetriol (1,2,6-HT) to 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD) in aqueous media over a Pt-WOx/TiO2 catalyst is examined via isotope incorporation in HDO of a model compound, 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PD). Absence of a primary kinetic isotope effect (k(H)/k(D) = 0.84 +/- 0.11) disproves a potential direct C-O bond scission mechanism. The observation of nearly complete deuterium incorporation in both the alpha-C and the beta-C is inconsistent with the reverse Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and suggests an enol formation pathway. Evidence consistent with the intermediacy of an oxocarbenium ion as a minor contributor has also been observed. In drawing the conclusions, it was necessary to characterize the facile isotope exchange between surface activated hydrogen and the water solvent. Hydrogenation of a water-soluble olefin, tetra(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (TEGDA) in H-2/D2O revealed predominant incorporation of deuterium instead of hydrogen in the reduced product, confirming the rapid exchange of surface activated hydrogen. The methods used in this study provide clarification about a reaction mechanism currently under debate, and these findings can be applied to other systems involving HDO of linear polyols over metal-metal oxide catalysts, improving catalyst design and utilization of sustainable feedstocks.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900057

In this study, SiO2 is deposited over the active sites of a macroporous, highly dispersed Ti-SiO2 catalyst, with or without an organic template. SiO2 deposition is shown to impact the local environment around epoxidation active sites without altering the active site or introducing diffusion limitations for the representative bulky alkene limonene. Thus, intrinsic activation enthalpies remain nearly constant (45 +/- 3 kJ/mol) across all materials and controls, but templated SiO2 deposition gives an apparent activation enthalpy (9 kJ/mol) much lower than that of the other materials tested because of its strong limonene adsorption. This demonstrates independent control of the active site, its immediate surroundings, and the extended pore structure, while also serving the practical purpose of creating a material that can outperform relevant benchmark materials. These types of materials may find utility in the selective transformation of larger reactants, including biorenewables such as limonene, or precursors for pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900058

This work explores the impact of cation-tunable hemilability on the speciation of iridium(III) pincer-crown ether catalysts during high-activity olefin isomerization. Under conditions where strong cation-macrocycle interactions are fostered and terminal olefin has been consumed, labilization of the aza-crown ether group leads to an eta(6)-arene complex, wherein the pincer ligand is metallated at a different position. Arene complexes of styrene, naphthalene, and mesitylene were independently synthesized and found to exhibit diminished catalytic activity for allylbenzene isomerization. In response to these findings, a previously unreported catalyst bearing a synthetically modified pincer ligand was designed, resulting in a refined system that maintains high activity even when arene complexes are formed.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900059

In a conventional process to accelerate the water oxidation, oxygen evolution cocatalysts (OECs) are usually used on the surface of a photoanode. As an alternative strategy, we considered employing a composite photoanode made up of a semiconductor and carbon spheres, for it is expected that the photogenerated electrons on the semiconductor particles can be captured by the carbon spheres as electron reservoirs and leave the photogenerated holes on the surface of the semiconductor particles, which promotes the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. More importantly, the holes accumulated in the valence band accelerate the water oxidation reaction rate with the rapid release of electrons stored on the carbon sphere. Therefore, the composite photoanode achieves a higher photocurrent at a lower applied bias. We provide a proof of concept for this strategy by preparing a composite photoanode by combining bismuth vanadium oxide BiVO4 with carbon spheres and find that the resulting photoanode displays a remarkable enhancement in the rate of the photoanode water oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900060

By comparison, only few studies address the degradation mechanism(s) of fuel cell catalysts in alkaline media. In this work, we investigate the stability of four different types of Pt/C fuel cell catalysts upon applying accelerated degradation tests in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setup equipped with an anion exchange membrane. In contrast to previous investigations exposing the catalysts to a liquid electrolyte, the GDE setup provides a realistic three-phase boundary of the reactant gas, catalyst, and ionomer which enables reactant transport rates close to real fuel cells. Therefore, the GDE setup mimics the degradation of the catalyst under more realistic reaction conditions as compared to conventional electrochemical cells. Combining the determination of the loss in the electrochemically active surface area of the Pt/C catalysts via CO stripping measurements with the change in particle size distribution determined by small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, we demonstrate that (i) the degradation mechanism depends on the investigated Pt/C catalyst and might indeed be different from the one observed in conventional electrochemical cells, (ii) degradation is increased in an oxygen gas atmosphere (as compared to an inert atmosphere), and (iii) the observed degradation mechanism depends on the mesoscopic environment of the active phase. The measurements indicate an increased particle growth if small and large particles are immobilized next to each other on the same carbon support flakes as compared to a simple mix of two catalysts with small and large particles, respectively.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900061

We describe a two-step multienzymatic reduction of a series of alpha-halo beta-alkyl tetrasubstituted cyclic enones, affording halohydrins with three contiguous stereogenic centers, in good yield and with a high stereoselectivity. The reduction is catalyzed by a stereospecific ene-reductase (OYE2-3 or NemA) and a highly enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The use of two enantiodivergent ADHs allows the control of the diastereoselectivity. The absolute stereochemical configurations of the products have been determined from the analysis of single-crystal structures (Flack's parameter). The enantiomeric excess (ee) has been determined by derivatization of the products with (R) Mosher's acid. Lastly, we extended our methodology also to a nonhalogenated substrate: the alpha-methyl ketoisophorone was reduced by two distinct enantiodivergent ene-reductases (flavin mononucleotide- and F420-dependent), affording each enantiomer of the saturated ketone with ee > 98%.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900062

Traditional CO2 capture methods employ temperature or pressure swings; however, electrochemical swings, in which an applied potential modulates nucleophilicity, are also possible to mediate the capture and release of CO2. In contrast to the breadth of electrochemical CO2 reduction research, electrochemically mediated CO2 capture and concentration is an emerging field. Although some aspects are reminiscent of those in CO2 reduction, like local pH gradients and (bi)carbonate equilibria, ultimately electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration poses its own unique challenges that will benefit from insights from intercalative batteries, redox flow batteries, and biomimetic/-inspired design, among other fields. After an introduction to carbon capture and current chemical strategies, this Review highlights promising emerging electrochemical methods to enable CO2 capture and concentration; specifically discussed are organic redox, transition metal redox, and pH swings. It closes with an outlook and discussion of future research challenges for electrochemically mediated capture.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900063

Their active site, the H-cluster, is composed of a [4Fe-4S] subcluster ([4Fe-4S](H)) covalently attached to a [2Fe] subcluster ([2Fe](H)). The two subclusters are strongly redox-coupled, and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) within the H-cluster is thought to be essential for catalytic activity. Additionally, proton-coupled reduction of [4Fe-4S](H) has been proposed. Here, we investigated the pH dependence of the redox behavior of [4Fe-4S](H) using infrared (IR) spectroelectrochemistry with two different [FeFe] hydrogenases: CrHydA1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and CpHydA1 from Clostridium pasteurianum. Contrary to previous reports, we find that, under our experimental conditions, the redox potential of [4Fe4S](H) is independent of pH around physiological values for both enzymes. We also found redox anticooperativity behavior between [4Fe-4S](H) and the accessory [4Fe-4S] clusters (F-clusters) in CpHydA1, which tunes catalysis at the active site. Taken together, these results indicate that the catalytic cycle of [FeFe] hydrogenases likely does not involve protonation at or near [4Fe-4S](H), and instead, favors a model in which protonation of [2Fe](H) drives catalysis. Our findings shed new light on the catalytic mechanism of [FeFe] hydrogenases and highlight the importance of the F-clusters in fine-tuning catalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900065

However, the insufficient long-term stability of these technologies precludes their commercial deployment. The structural deterioration of the catalyst material is one possible source of device durability issues. Unfortunately, this issue has been insufficiently studied in systems using actual technical electrodes. Herein, we make use of a morphologically tailored Ag-based model nanocatalyst [Ag nanocubes (NCs)] assembled on a zero-gap GDE electrolyzer to establish correlations between catalyst structures, experimental environments, electrocatalytic performances, and morphological degradation mechanisms in highly alkaline media. The morphological evolution of the Ag-NCs on the GDEs induced by the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR), as well as the direct mechanical contact between the catalyst layer and anion-exchange membrane, is analyzed by identical location and post-electrolysis scanning electron microscopy investigations. We find that at low and mild potentials positive of -1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl, the Ag-NCs undergo no apparent morphological alteration induced by the CO2RR, and the device performance remains stable. At more stringent cathodic conditions, device failure commences within minutes, and catalyst corrosion leads to slightly truncated cube morphologies and the appearance of smaller Ag nanoparticles. However, comparison with complementary CO2RR experiments performed in H-cell configurations in a neutral environment clearly proves that the system failure typically encountered in the gas-fed approaches does not stem solely from the catalyst morphological degradation. Instead, the observed CO2RR performance deterioration is mainly due to the local high alkalinity that inevitably develops at high current densities in the zero-gap approach and leads to the massive precipitation of carbonates which is not observed in the aqueous environment (H-cell configuration).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900066

A series of well-designed experiments including various isotopic experiments revealed that an acid-base pair catalysis was involved, that is, DCM mainly dissociated on Lewis acid sites and then dehydrochlorinated through hydroxyl groups/Bronsted acid sites, while the basicity was intrinsic to the generation of MCM via a hydride transfer reaction between DCM activated on basic sites and DCM dissociated on Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the superior redox ability could suppress the formation of MCM by a rapid catalytic oxidation but prompt the possible formation of Cl-2 and polychlorinated byproducts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900067

Herein, we present an engineered architecture for supported iridium catalysts, which enables decreased precious metal content and improved activity and conductivity. The improvement in performance at lower precious metal loading is realized by the deposition of a conformal layer of platinum nanoparticles on titanium dioxide (TiO2) using a facile photoreduction method to prepare conductive layer coated supports (CCSs). Platinum nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on TiO2, and the conductivity of the subsequent catalysts with 39 wt % precious group metal loadings is significantly higher than the commercial 75 wt % loaded IrO2-TiO2 catalysts. The conformal conductive layer also maintains an enhanced conductivity and electrochemical activity upon thermal annealing when compared to catalysts without the conductive layer and nonconformal heterogeneous conductive layer. The iridium mass activity from half-cell studies shows a 141% improvement for CCS supported catalysts at 42% lower loadings compared to the commercial catalysts. The conductive layer also improves the single cell electrolyzer performance at a similar catalyst loading in comparison to a commercial state-of-the-art catalyst. We correlate the physical properties of the engineered catalysts with their electrochemical performance in electrolyzers to understand structure-activity relationships, and we anticipate further performance improvements upon synthesis and materials optimizations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900068

Synthetic iron porphyrin model complexes mimicking the active site of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) are shown to enhance the rate of ORR and 4H(+)/4e(-) selectivity irrespective of the rate of electron transfer from the electrode relative to unfunctionalized iron porphyrins. In operando spectroscopic analysis over self-assembled monolayer-modified electrodes allows characterization of reactive intermediates involved in ORR. Two key intermediate species of ORR, Fe-III-OOH and Fe-IV=O, are identified using O-18(2) labeling depending on the nature of the pendant residue of these HRP mimics. The results indicate that the nature of the pendant distal moiety in the distal superstructure of iron porphyrin changes the distribution of the intermediate species under steady state relative to simple mononuclear porphyrins. Density functional theory calculations indicate that not only the presence of hydrogen bonding from the pendant groups but also its relative spatial orientation with respect to the proximal and distal oxygen atom of a Fe-III-OOH intermediate species controls the selectivity of ORR.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900069

Hybrid bilayer membranes (HBMs), comprising a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) covered by a lipid membrane, have been developed recently to regulate the performance of HBM-embedded electrocatalysts. A major technological roadblock in HBM development is the inability to facilitate proton transfer under alkaline conditions where nonprecious metal (NPM) catalysts can rival the performance of their precious metal counterparts. Here, we synthesized proton carriers bearing nitrile groups found in protonophores. These bioinspired proton carriers can facilitate transmembrane proton delivery to an HBM-supported Cu oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst under alkaline conditions. Our stimuli-responsive proton regulators can turn on the activity of the ORR catalyst on-demand, thereby opening doors to investigate how proton transfer kinetics govern the performance of electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900070

These conditions have been applied in four classes of NHC-catalyzed reaction. In all cases, the expected products were produced with high yield and enantioselectivity, using two sets of closely related reaction conditions, without additional optimization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200011

The modularity of our approach is shown by the introduction of several silyl- and alkyl-based protecting groups. To highlight functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity, we demonstrate the functionalization of a variety of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic aldehydes, even in the presence of ketones and esters. Mechanistic studies support a radical mechanism, starting from the single electron oxidation of the enol ether.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200015

This work employed anodic oxidation of Ir(III) intermediate (characterized by X-ray crystallography) to promote reductive elimination, giving the desired coupling products in good yields (up to 95%) without the addition of any other external oxidants. This transformation is suitable for various directing groups with H-2 as the only byproduct, which warrants a high atom economy and practical oxidative C-C bond formation under mild conditions.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200002

However, their utility in synthesis has been limited, as their generation required unstable, reactive starting materials and harsh reaction conditions. Visible-light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a platform for the mild production of aminium radical cations from either unfunctionalized or N-functionalized amines. This Perspective covers recent synthetic methods that rely on the photocatalytic generation of aminium radical cations for C-N bond formation, specifically in the context of alkene hydroamination, arene C-H bond amination, and the mesolytic bond cleavage of alkoxyamines.									18	0	0	0	6	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200004	33163257

Herein, transition metal (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) doping was used to introduce oxygen vacancies in CeO2 and promote activity for carbonyl sulfide (COS) hydrolysis. Various techniques were performed to accurately characterize the catalyst structure and state. The transition metals successfully entered the crystal lattice of CeO2 and formed a solid solution structure. The metal-doped CeO2 (M/CeO2) showed improved reduction properties, more Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies in comparison with pure CeO2. The introduction of transition metal greatly enhanced activity of M/CeO2 for COS hydrolysis. Among them, the Co/CeO2 sample displayed the highest activity and H2S selectivity. The roles of metal doping in improving activity were explored on the basis of DFT calculations. The strong interaction between doped metals and CeO2 promotes the spontaneous formation of asymmetric oxygen vacancies in M/CeO2. These asymmetric oxygen vacancies facilitate the activation and dissociation of H2O and generation of active hydroxyls, which contributes to the enhanced activity for COS hydrolysis. This work provides an attractive method for obtaining nonprecious metal catalysts for COS hydrolysis.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200005

Here, we report that the surface electronic structure of ruthenium (Ru) can be effectively modulated through phosphorus (P) doping to produce significantly enhanced catalytic HOR and HER performance in alkaline electrolyte. By controlling the amount of P, the resulted P-Ru/C exhibits outstanding catalytic activity, achieving a normalized exchange current density of 0.72 mA cm(-2) and mass activity of 0.43 mA mu g(-1), approximately 5 and 3.5 times higher than those of Ru/C, respectively, and even 2 times higher than that of Pt/C (commercial 20 wt %) for HOR. Moreover, sixfold enhancement compared with Ru/C in the HER can be achieved from P-Ru/C. Experimental and density functional theory results indicate that electronic manipulation through P-doping is beneficial to the prominent HOR/HER performance and enhanced kinetics.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200006

The catalytic activities of conventional dual-catalytic systems, however, are limited by the low synergistic efficiency between discrete catalytic centers due to their long average distance in solution. Herein we carefully decorated Ir(III) photosensitizers and Ni(II) transition-metal catalyst into flexible polymers to afford two polymer-supported dual catalysts (P1-Ni and P2-Ni). These polyelectrolyte-type metallopolymers assembled into spherical polymer particles in some polar solvents. Their unique molecular and assembled structure contributed to shortening the distance between catalytic centers and increasing the local catalysts' concentration within the catalyst, thereby greatly facilitating their electron, energy, and organic radical transfers during the catalytic cycles. The enhanced energy interaction and matched redox potential between two catalytic centers within the polymer were confirmed by steady- and transient-state luminescent spectra and cyclic voltammetry. These features enable them in catalyzing challenging organic transformations that involve efficiently incorporated photocatalytic and transition-metal catalytic cycles. We demonstrated that these two catalysts were highly effective in catalyzing C-S cross-coupling, C-O functionalized, C-N cross-coupling, and C-C cross-coupling reactions with broad substrate scopes and low catalyst loadings with turnover numbers of similar to 3100, similar to 1500, similar to 1400, and similar to 500, respectively. This work provides a general methodology to merge photosensitizer and transition-metal catalyst in a flexible polymer for significantly boosting the catalytic activity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200007

NiFeOx catalysts were grown on both Au(111) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrodes. DFT predicted Fe edge-site atoms at the NiFeOx/Au(111) interface to be the most thermodynamically favorable reaction center, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data indicated small NiFeOx catalyst particles on Au(111) contained a high population of OER active Fe edge-site atoms. However, restructuring of the Au(111) surface due to repeated oxidation and reduction cycles of the OER CV measurements encapsulated small NiFeOx nanoparticles at catalyst loadings below similar to 1.5 nmolmetal/cm(2), passivated catalyst edges and reduced bulk OER activity of Au-supported NiFeOx compared with HOPG-supported ones. Analysis of intrinsic activity revealed that the Au(111) support strongly benefited electrochemically accessible NiFeOx atoms, and we observed a 2-3 fold activity enhancement compared with HOPG-supported catalysts for loadings above similar to 1 nmolmetal/cm(2). Evaluating bulk vs intrinsic activity and identifying loading/coverage-dependent support effects is important for accurately probing fundamental interfacial chemistry, choosing suitable catalyst loadings and supports, and optimizing system parameters to maximize the performance of electrocatalyst systems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200008

The position of the cofactor, in turn, was found to be related to the preferred catalytic reactivity, which is either the enantioselective Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indoles with beta-substituted enones or the tandem Friedel-Crafts alkylation/enantioselective protonation of indoles with alpha-substituted enones. The artificial metalloenzyme could be specialized for one of these catalytic reactions introducing a single mutation in the protein. The relation between cofactor dynamics and activity and selectivity in catalysis has not been described for natural enzymes and, to date, appears to be particular for artificial metalloenzymes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200010	33101759

Using the crystal structure of human NAAA as a starting point, we investigated the catalytic mechanism of PEA hydrolysis with a multiscale approach based on classic molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations coupled with enhanced sampling and path-collective variables (PCVs). The proton configuration of the catalytic nucleophile, Cys126, and of the surrounding carboxylates was critical to preserve the active site architecture. A stable Michaelis complex was then used to reconstruct the free-energy surfaces of NAAA acylation and deacylation during PEA hydrolysis. Acylation emerged as the critical step, with Cys126 acting both as an acid, to protonate the ethanolamine leaving group, and as a nucleophile, to attack the PEA carbonyl carbon. The ethanol fragment of PEA did not appear to play an indispensable role in acylation, a result further supported by kinetic experiments showing that NAAA hydrolyzes palmitoyl methyl amide (PMA) with high catalytic efficiency. Our multiscale approach identified a distinctive protonation state and catalytic mechanism for NAAA which accounts for pH-dependent activity, mutagenesis data, and mechanism of covalent inhibitors.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200012

We address this inherent complexity by extending computational materials screening over a diverse set of such sites. For the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at molybdenum carbides, extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations for key reaction intermediates at these sites show that differing adsorption modes break many of the scaling relations known to hold across transition metals. Despite the resulting inherently rich reduction chemistry, clear trends emerge. Notably, this includes a product selectivity governed by the metal/carbon ratio of the active site. The trend toward methanol formation for C-containing active sites mirrors thermal heterogeneous CO2 activation and suggests a shift of focus toward more C-rich carbides for CO2RR to methanol.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200013

Significant insight into heterogeneous systems has been gained over the years through the synthesis, characterization, and application of well-defined surface organometallic catalysts, predominantly supported on silica and alumina. Considerable research efforts have focused on the application of homogeneous methods to the synthesis and characterization of these systems. Homogeneous catalysis has thrived on its ability to electronically and sterically tune ligands to yield desired reactivity and selectivity. Efforts in SOMC, however, have only recently turned to harnessing the stereoelectronic diversity of potential inorganic support materials beyond silica and alumina in order to exert similar control on the reactivity of the organometallic active site. The support material is intrinsically linked to electronic structure and reactivity of heterogeneous organometallic systems in the same way that ligands exert control over homogeneous catalyst systems. The ability to tune the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts by changing the support is of great value, and it is anticipated that this will represent an area of significant growth in the field. In this Perspective, the use and future of nontraditional catalyst supports, such as sulfated metal oxides, modified silicas, and redox active supports are discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200014

We report herein a variety of ionic liquid-grafted UiO-66 solid superacids synthesized from quaternization of UiO-66 with 1,3-propane sultone, ion-exchanging with H2SO4 or HSO3CF3. The developed UiO-66 solid superacids are highly efficient in catalyzing biodiesel production toward transesterification, which were better than the ionic liquid and neat H2SO4. The remarkable activities found in the UiO-66 solid superacids benefit from the synergistic effect of high acid concentrations (similar to 3.33 mmol/g), superacidity (determined by P-31 solid-state NMR, Hammett indicators, and potentiometric titration), as well as unique shape-selective confinement for methanol into the ordered and uniform micropores, which targeted the activation of methanol to prevent the occurring of an inverse reaction in the reactions. The UiO-66 solid superacids show important application potentials in the area of biodiesel production in the industry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200016

In this type of octahedral metal complex, cis-alpha, cis-beta, and trans topologies may be formed, and many studies have reported the reactivity and topology of iron(II) complexes. However, the ligand topology effects of analogous manganese(II) complexes are generally still poorly understood. Herein, we report a systematic study on the ligand topology structure and catalytic activity in the asymmetric epoxidation of olefin with manganese complexes bearing different aryl-substituted mcp ligands (mcp = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine). In particular, a class of quasitrans topology manganese complexes bearing 4-tert-Bu-phenyl-substituted mcp ligands are prepared and characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The quasitrans topology manganese complexes undergo efficient olefin epoxidation with H2O2 as the oxidant in the presence of carboxylic acid or sulfuric acid. In addition, the mechanism of activation of H2O2 by these complexes is discussed based on density functional theory calculations.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200017

However, despite the remarkable specific activities of photobiocatalysts, self-shading at moderate-high cell densities limits efficient space-time-yields of heterologous enzymatic reactions. Moreover, efficient integration of an artificial electron sink into the tightly regulated network of cyanobacterial electron pathways can be highly challenging. Here, we used C=C bond reduction of 2-methylmaleimide by the NADPH-dependent ene-reductase YqjM as a model reaction for light-dependent biotransformations. Time-resolved NADPH fluorescence spectroscopy allowed direct monitoring of in-cell YqjM activity and revealed differences in NADPH steady-state levels and oxidation kinetics between different genetic constructs. This effect correlates with specific activities of whole-cells, which demonstrated conversions of >99%. Further channelling of electrons toward heterologous YqjM by inactivation of the flavodiiron proteins (Flv1/Flv3) led to a 2-fold improvement in specific activity at moderate cell densities, thereby elucidating the possibility of accelerating light-driven biotransformations by the removal of natural competing electron sinks. In the best case, an initial product formation rate of 18.3 mmol h(-1) L-1 was reached, allowing the complete conversion of a 60 mM substrate solution within 4 h.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200018	33101760

Descriptors for Zeolite Catalysts								ACS CATALYSIS				10	20			11878	11891		10.1021/acscatal.0c02799				OCT 16 2020	2020	Among the possible on-purpose technologies for propene production, direct conversion of butene-rich fractions to propene represents an attractive alternative to conventional routes such as steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. Here, we present an approach for designing an efficient ZSM-5-based catalyst for the selective cracking of butenes to propene by properly balancing diffusional and compositional effects. Instead of the large coffin-shaped ZSM-5 crystallites with very high Si/Al ratios generally reported, the optimal catalyst in terms of propene selectivity and catalyst life was found to be a ZSM-5 zeolite with a squared morphology, submicron-sized crystals (0.8 x 0.3 x 1.0 mu m), and a Si/Al molar ratio of around 300. For this crystal conformation, the short dimensions of both sinusoidal and straight channels facilitate propene diffusion and reduce its consumption in consecutive reactions, limiting the formation of C5+ oligomers and aromatics and maximizing propene selectivity. Coffin-type ZSM-5 crystals, with higher diffusional restrictions than square-shaped crystals, show faster catalyst deactivation than the latter, independently of the crystal size and Al content. However, among the ZSM-5 zeolite crystallites with a coffin morphology, the one presenting intergrowths on the (010) face, with a larger proportion of sinusoidal channels, shows a lower aromatic selectivity and deactivation rate, whereas the other two, with straight channels open to the clean (010) faces, favor the formation of aromatics by direct cyclization-dehydrogenation of oligomeric intermediates.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200019

Despite being an affordable and very promising catalyst for CO-PrOx, the CO oxidation activity, selectivity, and phase stability of cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4) may be affected by the other gas feed components, viz., H-2, H2O, and CO2. However, the influence of these gases (individually and collectively) during CO-PrOx is still not understood. In the current study, in situ powder X-ray diffraction and magnetometry were used to systematically evaluate unsupported Co3O4 nanoparticles under different CO-PrOx environments, that is, with/without H-2, H2O, and/or CO2. The presence of H-2 in the feed (with no H2O and CO2) results in the unwanted competitive conversion of the co-fed O-2 to H2O and in the reduction of Co3O4 to Co-0. The presence of Co-0 favors CH4 formation from CO, which is also undesired as it consumes valuable H-2. Co-feeding H2O not only decreases Co3O4 reducibility but also decreases CO oxidation activity through competitive surface adsorption. The forward water-gas shift is possible in the absence of CO2 in the feed over CoO and Co-0 at elevated reaction temperatures. Co-feeding CO2 has no effect on Co3O4 reducibility but leads to the unwanted CO2 methanation and reverse water-gas shift over Co-0. For the first time, the presented work shows the individual and combined effect of H-2, H2O, and CO2 on the progress of the targeted CO oxidation process through the occurrence of undesired side reactions. Also, for the first time, in situ catalyst characterization reveals the Co-based phase(s) responsible for the occurrence of each identified side reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200020

Gates. This Account highlights his key scientific achievements in three areas of significance: supported metal clusters and atomically dispersed metal complexes, hydroprocessing reaction networks and catalysts, and strong acid catalysis. His contributions in all three areas are noteworthy and have been sustained over 50 years. The work of his group evolved from mainly catalyst synthesis and reaction studies to also incorporate sophisticated characterization techniques based on X-ray absorption spectroscopies and improved scanning transmission electron microscopic examination of catalytic surfaces. In the course of this work, he has addressed, and contributed to the solutions of some of the most significant and challenging problems in catalysis of the last half century.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200021

Mass-transfer phenomena are thoroughly investigated, and the mass-transfer coefficient is deconvoluted from the intrinsic kinetic constant for each catalyst to enable the quantitative assessment of both. NbPO is found to be mass-transfer-limited. Despite this limitation, NbPO shows the highest yield of LA at 36%. The reaction over ZrPO is not transport-limited, allowing for a rigorous analysis of intrinsic kinetics. This analysis shows that the conversion of DHA into pyruvaldehyde (PVA) follows a second-order reaction mechanism via a dimeric intermediate, which consolidates previous reports in the literature. Additionally, a correlation between LA production and the carbon missing from the carbon balance (carbon loss) is observed. Finally, NbPO and ZrPO show stable performance up to 10 h on stream at 150 degrees C. After 15 h of reaction, the PVA yield increases at the expense of LA with NbPO. This is ascribed to the deactivation of the active sites necessary to produce LA, which are different from the sites that produce PVA. This hypothesis is supported by the characterization of the spent catalyst with C-13 magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200022

GY is a decent support for isolated transition-metal (TM) atom catalysts because the most active sp-hybridized carbon atoms exist on the GY surface. All the single TM atoms are trapped into the void of the GY surface and existed in the isolated form. The molecular geometries and adsorbate binding energies of NO@TM-GY, ON@TM-GY, and O-2@TM-GY configurations are determined. We find that the Cr-GY is the most promising SAC for NO oxidation and reduction compared with the other TM-SACs. Herein, we report an efficient NO oxidation and reduction catalyzed by Cr-GY at ambient temperature. We find that Cr-GY SAC is very reactive for NO oxidation and reduction at ambient temperatures with low activation barriers to the rate-determining steps for Eley-Rideal (0.87, 0.60, and 0.62 eV) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (0.69, 0.62, and 0.84 eV) mechanisms. The Termolecular Eley-Rideal mechanism for the formation of the NO2 molecule is not thermodynamically favorable. Comparative analysis revealed that the NO reduction (0.62 eV) is more favorable than NO oxidation (0.84 eV). These findings provide valuable perceptions for design of highly efficient and selective heterogeneous SACs for NO oxidation and reduction with TMs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200023

Despite considerable progress, the specificity of alkene substrates or the adjustment of ligands was necessary for specific regioselectivities, which restrict the universality and practicability. Herein, we report a ligand-free iron-catalyzed regiodivergent hydroboration of aliphatic terminal alkenes that obtains both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov hydroboration products in high regioselectivities. Notably, solvents and bases were shown to be crucial factors influencing the regioselectivities and further studies suggested that the iron-boron alkoxide ate complex is the key intermediate that determines the unusual Markovnikov regioselectivity. Terminal alkenes with diverse structures (monosubstituted and 1,1-disubstituted, open-chain and exocyclic) underwent the transformation smoothly. The reaction does not require the addition of auxiliary ligands and it can be performed on a gram scale, thus providing an efficient and sustainable method for the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl borates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200025

We developed a rhodium-catalyzed C-H functionalization of indoles at the C4 position using alpha,beta-unsaturated enones as versatile DGs. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the C-H activation process was reversible and the course of Rh-carbene generation controlled the overall site-selectivity of the C-H functionalization. The introduced malonate unit and the used enone DG were cyclized in a further C-C bond forming process to assemble 3,4-fused tricyclic indoles in an asymmetric manner. Telescoping the two reaction sequences provided rapid entry into this densely functionalized indole architecture from readily available chemical feedstock.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200026

Among these approaches, allylic fluorination is a reaction that relies on a key carbon-fluorine bond-forming step to generate allylic fluorides. These fluorinated products can serve as building blocks for the preparation of valuable fluorine-containing synthons. Such important motifs can be found in agrochemicals, pharmaceutical agents, and PET radiotracers. Despite their prevalence and the importance of their applications, efficient methodology for their selective synthesis remains underdeveloped. Significant progress has been made in the past decade with the use of transition metals as catalysts. The search for a triad of transition metal, nucleophilic fluoride source, and leaving group enables the discovery of new allylic fluorination methods. This Perspective critically assesses recent efforts made to expand the methodology used to construct allylic C-F bonds via nucleophilic fluoride sources and provides a thorough analysis of their performance.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200027

Here, we report the single-atom doping effect on CO2 reduction by comparing monopalladium-doped Pd1Au24 and homogold Au-25 nanoclusters (both protected by thiolates) that share an identical core structure. Experimental results show that single Pd-substitution drastically inhibits H-2 evolution at large currents; thus, Pd1Au24 can convert CO2 to CO with similar to 100% faradaic efficiency ranging from -0.6 (onset) to -1.2 V (vs RHE), while Au-25 starts to decline at -0.9 V. Theoretical simulations reveal that the Pd dopant influences the Au nanocluster properties through a unique mechanism different from that in conventional alloy nanoparticles. The surface S atoms of the thiolate ligand are identified as the active sites (with the Au-13 core as the electron reservoir) for selective CO2 reduction, whereas undercoordinated Au atom active sites are predicted to favor H-2 evolution. Thermodynamic analysis of the ligand removal process predicts that Pd1Au24 should retain a larger population of S atom active sites under cathodic potentials compared with Au-25, which extends the potential range for selective CO2 reduction. Our results demonstrate that single-atom substitution can substantially improve the CO2 reduction selectivity of gold nanoclusters at large potentials. The dopant-induced ligand stability may serve as a design strategy to modify the stability of catalytic active sites under harsh conditions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200028

For example, TiO2-supported manganese oxide, a promising material for catalyzing the selective reduction of NO with NH3 at very low temperatures, is currently restricted by poor selectivity because of the production of unwanted N2O, which has a greenhouse gas potential 300 times higher than that of CO2. In this study, we located manganese oxides in microporous TiO2 with small pores of molecular dimensions and found that this catalyst exhibited superior N-2 selectivity (more than 98% at 100-200 degrees C) as compared to that of conventional Mn/TiO2 nanoparticles. The enhancement in N-2 selectivity was consistently observed regardless of the amount of Mn active sites, demonstrating that the confining void environment is able to affect the site-specific selectivity of manganese oxides. When the reaction was performed at a low temperature (175 degrees C), it was found that the same reactive intermediate, possibly ammonium nitrate, was formed and deposited on both catalysts. However, the N-2 selectivity in the reaction of this intermediate and NO was greatly improved in small-pore environments. In addition, it was demonstrated that such reactive intermediates are effectively stabilized when confined in small pores, thereby blocking the reaction pathway in which the intermediates directly decompose into N2O. This approach to confining active sites within the pores of support materials provides a rational strategy for designing highly selective catalytic materials.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200029

Variations in the reaction conditions make it difficult to compare the performance characteristics of different catalysts, however, and limits the ability to leverage insights to design improved catalysts. Here, we show that free energy relationships between the logarithm of the turnover frequency [log(TOF)] and the effective overpotential (eta(eff)) for the ORR enable systematic comparison of the catalytic performance of diverse Co-macrocycles under a variety of reaction conditions. The study is initiated by evaluating the ORR log(TOF)/eta(eff) correlation for a series of Co(porphyrin) catalysts. The data show that these catalysts exhibit a different linear free energy relationship relative to previously reported Co(N2O2) complexes and that this difference correlates with different rate laws associated with the two different classes of catalysts. These linear relationships are then compared to log(TOF)/eta(eff) data for a diverse collection of other homogeneous cobalt ORR catalysts reported previously in the literature, and the collective analysis shows how different catalyst systems and their performance may be compared, even when the reactions are conducted under different conditions. This benchmarking method is recommended as a general strategy for systematic comparison of other (electro)catalysts and catalytic reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200030

In the study, the reactivity of the methyl glycosides in DODH was clearly lower than that of simple cyclic vicinal diols, such as cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol and cis-1,2-cyclo-pentanediol, and the reactivity of the methyl glycosides was also different. Herein, we investigated the reactivity difference based on kinetic studies and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The kinetic studies suggest that the reactivity difference between the methyl glycosides and the simple diols is derived from the OH group of methyl glycosides except the cis-vicinal diols, and that the reactivity difference among the methyl glycosides will be associated with the configuration of the substituents adjacent to the cis-vicinal diols, while the reaction mechanism of DODH is suggested to be basically similar judging from almost the same reaction orders with respect to the substrate concentration and H-2 pressure in all substrates. The adsorption and transition states of methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside and methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside, which have a large reactivity difference (methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside >> methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside), were estimated by DFT calculations with ReOx/CeO2 as the active site of the ReOx-Pd/CeO2 catalyst, showing that the main difference is the activation energy in DODH of these substrates (65 kJ mol(-1) for methyl alpha-Lrhamnopyranoside and 77 kJ mol(-1) for methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside), which was also supported by the results of Arrhenius plots (63 and 73 kJ mol(-1) for methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside and methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside, respectively). The activation energy was influenced by the torsional angle of the substituents adjacent to the cis-vicinal OH groups, which is derived from the interaction of the OH group adjacent to the cis-vicinal OH groups and the surface hydroxy groups on CeO2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200031

These interfacial sites play a vital role in many renewable applications, for instance, catalytic CO2 reduction. Postsynthesis deposition of metal oxide on supported metal catalysts can not only create such interfacial sites but also prevent particle sintering at high temperature. Here, we report a sol-gel-based strategy to synthesize an atomically dispersed "precatalyst". In contrast to the deposition on catalysts containing preformed nanoparticles, overcoating this material before reductive treatment can inhibit particle growth during thermal activation steps, yielding highly accessible, sintering-resistant Pd clusters that are less than 2 nm in diameter. This synthetic approach allows us to engineer interfacial sites while maintaining high metal accessibility, which was difficult to achieve in previous overcoated materials. Notably, engineering the Pd-ZrO2 interface into an inverted interface with an amorphous ZrO2 overcoat might facilitate a C-O cleavage route instead of a mechanism containing a bicarbonate intermediate during CO2 hydrogenation. We also observed that carbon deposition occurring on methanation sites could be a key factor for improving CO selectivity. Alteration of the reaction pathway, along with the deactivation of certain sites, led to 100% CO selectivity on the ZrO2@Pd/ZrO2 catalyst. This work demonstrated that overcoated materials could represent a promising class of heterogeneous catalysts for selective CO2 conversion over noble metals, which have higher rates and thermal stability compared to state-of-the-art Cu-based catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200033

Previous studies suggest that Co atoms located at the Co-MnO perimeter adsorb CO more strongly and undergo C-O bond cleavage more readily than CO adsorbed on Co sites, which leads to improved C5+ selectivity. Thus, direct characterization of the formation and structure of the active interface between Co nanoparticles and MnO is essential for a full understanding of the FTS promotion effect. Scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) methods are well-suited for direct characterization of nanoscale features through imaging, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping, and spatially resolved electron diffraction, a technique known as scanning nanobeam diffraction. However, these techniques require that the catalytic nanoparticles are non-overlapping and well-defined, which is not typical for nanoparticles on porous metal oxide FTS supports. In the present study, we addressed these challenges by synthesizing catalysts composed of cobalt dispersed on nonporous alumina nanospheres (Co/ANS), which yielded isolated nanoparticles that are amenable to elemental and phase mapping by STEM-EDS and scanning nanobeam diffraction. Then, manganese oxide-promoted Co/ANS (Mn-Co/ANS) was characterized using these two techniques, which provided direct evidence for the transformation of a Co-Mn oxide spinel present in the as-prepared catalyst into closely associated Co3O4 and MnO2 nanoparticles in the passivated catalyst after its use for FTS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200034

Herein, Ti3+-enriched N,C-codoped mixed-phase TiO2 nanoparticles featuring a reduced (compared to that of pristine TiO2) band gap and containing Ti3+ ions, oxygen vacancies, and Ti-X bonds (X = O, OH, N, C) were synthesized as a durable PEMFC cathode support by annealing. The extent of doping was controlled by adjustment of dopant (urea) loading, while the abundance of defect sites resulted in an enhanced metal-support interaction (i.e., Pt-Ti bonding) for Pt/N,C-codoped TiO2, as confirmed by the shift of the most prominent Pt-0 peak of Pt/N,C-codoped TiO2 to lower binding energies (by 0.96 eV) relative to that of Pt/C. Electrochemical performance testing of the above support revealed its high activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and elevated durability. In particular, a maximum power density decrease of only 4% (cf. 52% for Pt/C under the same conditions) and high durability under PEMFC operation conditions were observed in a single-cell test. Thus, the presented results highlight the great potential of TiO2 as an electrocatalyst support, paving the way to the fabrication of high-performance hydrogen fuel cells and contributing to the establishment of a hydrogen society.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200035

Here we uncover the catalytic molecular mechanism of GALC using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods. Our results clarify the unusual chair conformation of the substrate observed in the crystal structure and show that catalysis can take place via two distinct conformational pathways (S-1(3) -> [H-4(3)]double dagger -> C-4(1) and C-4(1) ->[H-4(3)]double dagger -> C-4(1)) with similar free energy barriers because of leaving group flexibility. This mechanistic insight will aid in the design of Krabbe diagnosis probes and GALC conformational chaperones.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200036

However, precise control of C-O activation and subsequent C-C coupling toward those olefins remain a challenge, due to the unclear catalytic mechanism on active sites and surrounding promoters. Herein, we demonstrate that the carbonaceous series K-promoters from K2CO3, CH3COOK, KHCO3, and KOH can induce Fe/C catalysts to form a more active and distinct Fe5C2-K2CO3 interface in nanoscale via CO2 hydrogenation, which boosts the production of high-valued olefins by facilitating electron transfer from potassium to iron species. A high olefin selectivity of near 75% in hydrocarbons is realized at a conversion of more than 32%. The maximum yield of high-valued olefins reaches up to 20.1%, which is the record-breaking highest value among all Fe based CO2 hydrogenation in the literature. More interestingly, the appropriate proximity between carbonaceous K-promoters and Fe/C catalyst endow the catalytic system with an outstanding high-valued olefin yield and high catalytic stability. These findings enrich the chemistry of CO2 conversion and provide a strategy to design highly selective catalysts for high-valued chemicals.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200037

However, there is rarely a report about the increase in oxygen vacancies using a facile method in monolith catalysts. Besides, the corresponding mechanism of the promotional effects of oxygen vacancies over the monolith catalysts still remains elusive. In this work, Co3O4 nanowires with abundant oxygen vacancies in situ grown on the Ni foam (r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam) were synthesized and used as high-performance monolith catalysts for catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde. The r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts showed outstanding catalytic activity and stability. The T10 (temperature when HCHO conversion achieved 10%) of r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts (75 degrees C) was lower than that of Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts (100 degrees C) and Co3O4 NP catalysts (132 degrees C). More importantly, the r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts have more active oxygen species because of the promotional effects of surface oxygen vacancies. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTs) results revealed that the formate species were reaction intermediates of HCHO catalytic oxidation reactions. However, the formate species on the surface of r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts were more active thus could easily take part in catalytic reactions. Furthermore, combined with the calculation results, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies could weaken O-2 adsorption energy and make r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts adsorb and store more active oxygen species, thus promoting more reaction intermediates to generate with a higher rate in redox cycles. The present investigations in this work may lead to an alternative development of high-performance monolith catalysts for VOC catalytic oxidation.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200039

However, the effect of alloy composition has not been systematically studied. Herein, using metallic anodes with defined Fe-Ni-Co atomic ratios prepared via arc melting, we report the relationship between the initial alloy composition, the OER performance, and the emergent active catalyst composition. After 50 h operation at 0.5 A cm(-2) the most active initial alloys (having a moderate amount of cobalt <40 at. %, an iron proportion between 30 and 80 at. % and a nickel ratio below 60 at. %) gave average overpotentials for 10 mA cm(-2) ca. 300-320 mV and Tafel slopes of 35-50 mV dec(-1). Iron and nickel-rich alloys performed poorer. The oxyhydroxide OER catalyst formed on the anode surface generally showed an increased concentration of Co and Ni and a depletion of Fe compared to the initial metal composition, giving the most active OER catalyst at a composition of Ni and Co of ca. 40 at. % with Fe at ca. 20 at. %. However, the initial alloy composition of Fe12.5Co12.5Ni75, showed a nearly invariant surface metal composition, indicating this as the most stable composition. Further analysis of the surface identified no correlation of the mass of metals leached from the anode surface, the electrochemically active surface area, or the presence of active Ni2+/3+ redox surface sites to the OER performance suggesting these factors do not influence the results.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200040

Here, we employed density functional theory to study Co-N-doped carbon as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Specifically, we investigated the interplay among adsorption energies, the spin state of the CoN4 active center, and the applied potential. We found that adsorption energies strongly depend on both the applied potential and the spin state of the Co center. Furthermore, spin state transitions induced by the applied potential also play an important role in determining the adsorption energies. This effect originates from a different potential of zero charge and capacitance of each spin state.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200041

To obtain insight into the structure of this layer and possible surface phases, CO structures on a Co(0001) model have been investigated by high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The experiments were performed in situ, at CO pressures between 10(-9) and 800 mbar and at a temperature of 300 K. Under these conditions, an adsorption-desorption equilibrium was established, reflecting the situation of the reaction. A series of CO surface phases were observed; from 10(-9) to 10(-7) mbar, a (root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees structure; between 10(-6) and 10(-3) mbar, a disordered phase representing a nonstoichiometric, fluctuating (root 7 x root 7)R19.1 degrees structure; and between 10(-2) and 100 mbar, a (2 root 3 x 2 root 3)R30 degrees structure. Between 100 and 800 mbar, three moire structures were observed that were analyzed by a recently developed method. All phases were formed by intact CO molecules. A phase diagram was obtained that allowed us to extrapolate the stability regions of the CO phases to industrial Fischer-Tropsch conditions. We conclude that the reaction operates in the region of the disordered phase at a coverage between 0.43 and 0.50 monolayers of CO.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200042

In the presence of an advanced ligand L2 bearing 2-pyridyl substituent as a built-in base, either hydroformylation or semihydrogenation of diverse alkynes occurs with high chemo- and stereoselectivity under comparable conditions. Mechanistic studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, kinetic analysis, and control experiments, revealed that the strength and concentration of acidic cocatalysts play a decisive role in controlling the chemoselectivity. DFT studies disclosed that ligand L2 not only promotes heterolytic activation of hydrogen similar to frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) systems in the hydrogenolysis step for hydroformylation but also suppresses CO coordination to promote semihydrogenation under strong acid conditions. This switchable selectivity provides a strategy to design new catalysts for desired products.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200043

In this work, we explore several Ru-based pyrochlores (A(2)Ru(2)O(7), A = Y, Nd, Gd, Bi) as OER catalysts and demonstrate improved activity and stability of catalytic Ru sites relative to RuO2. Furthermore, we combine complementary experimental and theoretical analysis to understand how the A-site element impacts activity and stability under acidic OER conditions. Among the A(2)Ru(2)O(7) studied herein, we find that a longer Ru-O bond and a weaker interaction of the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals compared with RuO2 results in enhanced initial activity. We observe that the OER activity of the catalysts changes over time and is accompanied by both A-site and Ru dissolution at different relative rates depending on the identity of the A-site. Pourbaix diagrams constructed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a driving force for this experimentally observed dissolution, indicating that all compositions studied herein are thermodynamically unstable in acidic OER conditions. Theoretical activity predictions show consistent trends between A-site cation leaching and OER activity. These trends coupled with Bader charge analysis suggest that dissolution exposes highly oxidized Ru sites that exhibit enhanced activity. Overall, using the stability number (mol(O2 evolved)/mol(Ru dissolved)) as a comparative metric, the A(2)Ru(2)O(7) materials studied in this work show substantially greater stability than a standard RuO2 and commensurate stability to some Ir mixed metal oxides. The insights described herein provide a pathway to enhanced Ru catalyst activity and durability, ultimately improving the efficiency of water electrolyzers.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200044		
J	Vega-Vila, Juan Carlos; Gounder, Rajamani								Quantification of Intraporous Hydrophilic Binding Sites in Lewis Acid Zeolites and Consequences for Sugar Isomerization Catalysis								ACS CATALYSIS				10	20			12197	12211		10.1021/acscatal.0c02918				OCT 16 2020	2020	Aqueous-phase sugar isomerization is catalyzed at lower turnover rates when Lewis acid active sites are confined within high-defect zeolite micropores, because intraporous silanol groups serve as hydrophilic binding sites that stabilize extended water networks during catalysis that entropically destabilize isomerization transition states relative to their precursors. The number of intraporous silanol defects varies widely among Lewis acid zeolites prepared by different hydrothermal and post-synthetic routes, and after subsequent activation treatments prior to catalysis, thus leading to unintended or unpredictable consequences for reactivity. Here, we develop a suite of methods to characterize and quantify intraporous silanol groups in Lewis acid zeolites and provide a link between the number of such groups and glucose isomerization rate constants. Sn-Beta zeolites were prepared with systematically varying silanol density by increasing the extent of Sn grafting into various dealuminated Beta supports, which were derived from parent Al-Beta zeolites synthesized both with varying initial Al content (Si/Al = 19-180, 0.4-3.2 Al (unit cell)(-1)) and defect density via the mineralizing agent used (F-, OH-). The packing density of methanol within micropores was used as a reporter of the intraporous silanol density and was quantified from relative methanol (293 K) and dinitrogen (77 K) uptakes at the point of micropore filling from single-component adsorption isotherms; methanol packing densities decreased systematically from 0.98 to 0.07 among Sn-Beta samples with increasing SiOH density. In situ IR spectra (CH3OH reduced pressure < 0.2, 303 K) indicate that methanol arranges in isolated clusters within low-defect Sn-Beta micropores (<1 silanol (unit cell)(-1)), but forms extended hydrogen-bonded networks within high-defect micropores (>1 silanol (unit cell)(-1)). On each sample, the total number of extracrystalline and intraporous SiOH groups was quantified by H/D isotopic exchange with D-2 via temperature-programmed surface reaction (500-873 K), while the number of intraporous SiOH groups was quantified from strongly H-bound CD3CN in IR spectra (2275 cm(-1), 303 K). Aqueous-phase first-order glucose isomerization rate constants (per defect-open Sn, 373 K) were 4 times higher on Sn-Beta prepared post-synthetically from dealuminated Beta supports whose parent Al-Beta zeolites were initially low-defect (<0.6 Al (unit cell)(-1)) than high-defect (>0.6 Al (unit cell)(-1)). These findings constitute a synthesis-structure-function relationship that provides specific guidance to minimize the density of intraporous defects when using post-synthetic routes to prepare catalytic materials with reactivity comparable to their hydrothermally crystallized hydrophobic analogues.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200045

The discovery of an enzyme with 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose to produce D-tagatose has been a major goal in the sugar industry. However, no enzymes used for the direct production of D-tagatose from D-fructose have been identified until now. Here, we identified a tagaturonate 3-epimerase from Thermotoga petrophila with latent 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose. We developed this enzyme into tagatose 4-epimerase by increasing the 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose using structure-based engineering, including favorable interaction analysis and active-site modifications, and random mutagenesis, including saturation mutagenesis and DNA shuffling after error-prone PCR. The developed tagatose 4-epimerase, which showed 184-fold higher 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose than that of tagaturonate 3-epimerase, produced 213 g/L D-tagatose using D-fructose in 2 h. Our results suggest that the tagatose 4-epimerase is an alternative enzyme for D-tagatose production via a different biocatalytic route.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200046

Iron-dependent oxygenases exploit this earth-abundant transition metal for the insertion of oxygen atoms into organic compounds. Throughout the astounding diversity of transformations catalyzed by these enzymes, the protein framework directs reactive intermediates toward the precise formation of products, which, in many cases, necessitates the cleavage of strong C-H bonds. In recent years, members of several iron-dependent oxygenase families have been engineered for new-to-nature transformations that offer advantages over conventional synthetic methods. In this Perspective, we first explore what is known about the reactivity of heme-dependent cytochrome P450 oxygenases and nonheme iron-dependent oxygenases bearing the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad by reviewing mechanistic studies with an emphasis on how the protein scaffold maximizes the catalytic potential of the iron-heme and iron cofactors. We then review how these cofactors have been repurposed for abiological transformations by engineering the protein frameworks of these enzymes. Finally, we discuss contemporary challenges associated with engineering these platforms and comment on their roles in biocatalysis moving forward.									13	0	0	0	4	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200049	33282461

Conjugated polymers (CPs)-based materials have recently shown great potential for diverse photocatalytic applications because of their unique properties, such as structural designability, recyclability, high chemical stability, and low cost, and they have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional molecular or inorganic photocatalyst in photoredox reactions. Immense efforts have been made toward the construction of CPs-based materials for versatile photocatalytic chemical transformations. In this Review, we aim to summarize the recent progress in CPs-based photocatalysts for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations including oxidation, reduction, coupling, and cycloaddition reaction. This Review discusses the influence of molecular, electronic, and channel structure of CPs-based materials on light absorption, charge separation, and mass transfer in different photocatalytic photoredox reactions. The regulated synthesis, mechanistic discussions, and future challenges for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformation in CPs-based materials systems are also considered.

Addressing this challenge requires catalysts that can rapidly turnover with good selectivity and energetic efficiency. Herein, aqueous electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion using drop cast films of cobalt(II) 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin (CoTPOH) are described. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments show redox features that are consistent with formation of a Co-III-CO intermediate at near the CO2/CO thermodynamic potential that then releases CO upon further 1-electron reduction. Analysis of CV and controlled potential electrolysis experiments show that CoTPOH catalyzes the reduction of CO2 to CO with 50% Faradaic efficiency at 0.2 V applied overpotential. With >0.5 V applied overpotential, stable catalytic current density (>= 0.2 mA/cm(2)) is observed during 24 h of electrolysis, with 92% Faradaic efficiency for CO. The behavior of CoTPOH is distinct from the parent Co(II)(5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin) deposited on basal plane graphite under identical electrochemical conditions. These results demonstrate that CO2 reduction and activation are possible at very little overpotential in aqueous electrolyte, but CO release from Co(III) at low potentials is the limiting factor. The proposed mechanism offers alternative pathways to consider in the design and implementation of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. The incorporation of proton relays into heterogeneous catalysts remains a challenge, and this study of CoTPOH suggests that they can have a significant impact on catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200051

However, the full breadth of means by which the stereoselectivity of these catalysts can be tuned has not been fully elucidated. Herein, the origin of enantioselectivity in a catalytic asymmetric synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolinones using SPINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acids (ACS Catal. 2013, 3, 2244) is explored using density functional theory computations. We show that the enantioselectivity of this reaction is determined during the intramolecular amine addition step of an organocascade sequence and is modulated by differential noncovalent interactions of the substrate with the aryl groups of the catalyst as well as CH center dot center dot center dot O and NH center dot center dot center dot O interactions with the phosphate core of the catalyst. Most notably, we demonstrate that the strength of these latter interactions is modulated by their position within the electrostatic environment created by the catalyst. This provides clear evidence of the ability to precisely control the selectivity of an organocatalyzed reaction through the tuning of electrostatic interactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200052

To mitigate carbon corrosion, Pt is alloyed with iridium (Ir), which is catalytically active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with various compositions of PtxIry. The carbon-supported PtxIry alloy catalysts (PtxIry/C) show slightly lower initial activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than Pt/C. However, the ORR activities of the PtxIry/C catalysts increase with repeating potential cycles from 1.0 to 1.5 V-RHE, while Pt/C exhibits a rapid decay in the ORR activity and a mixture of Pt/C and Ir/C (Pt/C + Ir/C, Pt-to-Ir ratio of 85:15) maintains its initial activity. After 5k potential cycles, the mass activity of Pt85Ir15 was 0.071 A mg(PGM)(-1), which is significantly higher than that of Pt/C (0.017 A mg(PGM)(-1)) and Pt/C + Ir/C (0.039 A mg(PGM)(-1)). These results can be attributed to the atomically distributed Ir in Pt85Ir15. Clearly, carbon corrosion occurs in Pt/C and in Pt-rich regions of Pt/C + Ir/C, whereas the carbon support in Pt85Ir15/C is effectively protected from corrosion. As a result, the greatest amount of CO2 emission is detected as coming from Pt/C, followed by Pt/C + Ir/C and Pt85Ir15/C. During the potential cycles, high-index Pt facets are formed on the surface of Pt85Ir15/C, leading to an increase in the ORR activity. When employed as cathode catalysts of a PEMFC, Pt85Ir15/C exhibits improved durability compared to Pt/C and Pt/C + Ir/C under high-voltage cycles to 1.5 V (5k cycles). This work demonstrates that the atomic distribution of Ir in Pt is an effective strategy for mitigating corrosion of the carbon support and to enhance the durability of PEMFCs exposed to high potentials.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200053

As guaiacol adsorbs on Ru, it loses its strong aromaticity and undergoes a rapid H-shift from its hydroxyl to meta carbons (in relation to its hydroxyl group), causing adsorbed enol and keto surface isomers to exist in chemical equilibrium. HDO occurs via a hydridic H-adatom (H*) attack on the enol, followed by a kinetically relevant C-O bond rupture step, during which water shuttles the hydroxyl proton, enabling its intra-molecular attack on the methoxy, evolving to a highly charged [Ru-(s)-(C6H5O-)center dot center dot center dot(H+)center dot center dot center dot OCH3](dagger) transition state. The competing hydrogenation (HYD) begins with a rapid H* attack on the keto form, before a second, kinetically relevant H* attack without proton involvement. Water, despite shifting the thermodynamics toward the more polar surface keto, promotes HDO to a much greater extent than HYD, because of its dual catalytic roles in reducing the activation free energies-(i) it mobilizes the hydroxyl proton of partially saturated guaiacol (Bronsted acid) and functions cooperatively with the Ru metal surface (base) in rupturing the C-O bond and stabilizing the resulting cationic carbon-ring fragment and (ii) water layers solvate the charged [Ru-(s)-(C6H5O-)center dot center dot center dot(H+)center dot center dot center dot OCH3]dagger transition state. Free hydronium ions do catalyze a separate homogeneous enol-keto isomerization, but this reaction is kinetically unrelated to HDO catalysis. This mechanistic picture explains the strong effects of a polar protic solvent in hydrodeoxygenation, highlighting the requirements of surface hydrides and interfacial protons acting in tandem to complete a HDO turnover and the cooperative role of the protic solvent and the metal surface in breaking the aromaticity and preferentially stabilizing charged transition states.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200054

The reaction intermediate in the important Cu-I -> Cu-II reoxidation step has been proposed as the dicopper species. However, obtaining the definitive spectroscopic probe for the dicopper intermediate under NH3-SCR remains a quite challenging subject. Here we report spectroscopic evidence of the efficient generation of the dicopper intermediate in NH3-SCR over Cu-ion-exchanged zeolites. The state of the Cu ion under the NH3-SCR condition was analyzed using fiber-optic UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy; a distinct spectroscopic fingerprint of the (mu-eta(2):eta(2)-peroxo)dicopper(II) intermediate was detected. Our spectroscopic assignment was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. The intensity of the spectroscopic fingerprints of dimeric copper was much higher than expected from previous reports, and it was also found that such a spectroscopic probe is observable only under the NH3-SCR conditions. This finding strongly supports the previously suggested Cu dynamic contributions to NH3-SCR catalysis.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200055

Hemoproteins have recently emerged as promising biocatalysts for the formation of C-N bonds via carbene transfer, but asymmetric N-H carbene insertion reactions using these or other enzymes have so far been elusive. Here, we report the successful development of a biocatalytic strategy for the asymmetric N-H carbene insertion of aromatic amines with 2-diazopropanoate esters using engineered variants of myoglobin. High activity and stereoinduction in this reaction could be achieved by tuning the chiral environment around the heme cofactor in the metalloprotein in combination with catalyst-matching and tailoring of the diazo reagent. Using this approach, an efficient biocatalytic protocol for the synthesis of a broad range of substituted aryl amines with up to 82% ee was obtained. In addition, a stereocomplementary catalyst useful to access the mirror-image form of the N-H insertion products was identified. This work paves the way to asymmetric amine synthesis via biocatalytic carbene transfer, and the present strategy based on the synergistic combination of protein and diazo reagent engineering is expected to prove useful in the context of these as well as other challenging asymmetric carbene transfer reactions.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300014	34484852

The described method tolerates a variety of functional groups and provides access to a broad scope of trans-configurated cyclohexanols as potential building blocks for life sciences and beyond in a one-step procedure. The transformation is strategically important because arene hydrogenation preferentially delivers the opposite cis-isomers. The diastereoselectivity of the phenol hydrogenation can be switched to the cis-isomers by employing rhodium-based catalysts. Moreover, a protocol for the chemoselective hydrogenation of phenols to cyclohexanones was developed.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300042	33133752

We select isoprene (2-methylbutadiene) as a representative and relevant example of a nonsymmetric diene. A combined experimental-computational study on a large set of phosphine-modified palladium catalysts and reaction conditions aiming to understand the factors governing the selectivity shows that it can be controlled by selecting the protic solvent pK(a) and by the ligand. Atomistic and kinetic simulations reveal that the solvent switches the selectivity-determining step as a function of pK(a) from C-C oxidative coupling at low pKa values (preference for telomer head-to-head) to protonation at high pK(a) values (preference for telomer tail-to-tail). The selectivity toward tail-to-head telomer can be directed in moderately acidic solvents by selection of the appropriate ligand, which exerts steric control of the protonation step. Thus, using Et2NH as a nucleophile, it was possible to synthesize 3 of the 4 main isomers in very high yields and selectivities and to provide a complete mechanistic picture of Pd-catalyzed telomerization of nonsymmetric dienes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300053

Palladium-catalyzed C-H functionalization of the low-reactive C3 position was successfully performed in 2,5-diformylfuran, an important derivative of the biobased platform chemical 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural. The ligand-free catalytic arylation was carried out without using protecting or directing groups, which is of key importance for the studied area to achieve waste-minimized and step-economic biomass processing. The experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations revealed a reaction mechanism and indicated that the presence of the aldehyde group is essential for catalytic reaction. Enolization of the aldehyde group and Pd binding play an important role in governing the overall C-H functionalization pathway. One of the obtained arylated furanic compounds was tested as a model substrate for reduction and oxidation of carbonyl groups to highlight its versatile synthetic potential.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300054

In the hope to improve this condition, three ruthenium olefin metathesis catalysts bearing sterically reduced N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands with xylyl "arms" were synthesized, characterized using both computational and experimental techniques, and tested in a number of challenging reactions. The catalysts are predicted to initiate much faster than the analogue with mesityl N-substituents. We also foreboded the rotation of xylyl side groups at ambient temperature and the existence of all four atropoisomers in the solution, which was in agreement with experimental data. These catalysts exhibited high activity at relatively low temperatures (45-60 degrees C) and at reduced catalyst loadings in various reactions of sterically hindered alkenes, including complex polyfunctional substrates of pharmaceutical interest, such as yangonin precursors, chrysantemic acid derivatives, analogues of cannabinoid agonists, alpha-terpineol, and finally a thermally unstable peroxide.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300046	33123411

Amines constitute an aggressive challenge to ruthenium metathesis catalysts. Examined here is the impact of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), morpholine, n-butylamine, and triethylamine on Ru metathesis catalysts that represent the current state of the art, including cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes. Accordingly, the amine-tolerance of the nitro-Grela catalyst RuCl2(H(2)IMes)(=CHAr) (nG; Ar = C6H4-2-(OPr)-Pr-i-5-NO2) is compared with that of its CAAC analogues nGC1 and nGC2, and the Hoveyda-class catalyst RuCl2(C2)(=CHAr') HC2 (Ar' = C6H4-2-(OPr)-Pr-i). In C1, the carbene carbon is flanked by an N-2,6-Et2C6H3 group and a CMePh quaternary carbon; in C2, by an N-2-Pr-i-6-MeC6H3 group and a CMe2 quaternary carbon. The impact of 1 equiv amine per Ru on turnover numbers (TONs) in ring-closing metathesis of diethyl diallylmalonate was assessed at 9 ppm Ru, at RT and 70 degrees C. The deleterious impact of amines followed the trend NEt3 similar to (NH2Bu)-Bu-n << DBU similar to morpholine. Morpholine is shown to decompose nGC1 by nucleophilic abstraction of the methylidene ligand; DBU, by proton abstraction from the metallacyclobutane. Decomposition was minimized at 70 degrees C, at which nGC1 enabled TONs of ca. 60 000 even in the presence of morpholine or DBU, vs ca. 80 000 in the absence of base. Unexpectedly, H(2)IMes catalyst nG delivered 70-90% of the performance of nGC1 at high temperatures, and underwent decomposition by Bronsted base at a similar rate. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis shows that this similarity is due to comparable net electron donation by the H(2)IMes and C1 ligands. Catalysts bearing the smaller C2 ligand were comparatively insensitive to amines, owing to rapid, preferential bimolecular decomposition.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300064	33123412

However, the strong adsorption of *CO on the Fe-N-4 site embedded in intact graphene limits current density due to slow CO desorption process. Herein, we report how the manipulation of pore edges on graphene alters the local electronic structure of isolated Fe-N-4 sites and improves their intrinsic reactivity for prompting CO generation. We demonstrate that constructing holes on graphene basal plane to support Fe-N-4 can significantly enhance its CO2RR compared to the pore-deficient graphene-supported counterpart, exhibiting a CO Faradaic efficiency of 94% and a turnover frequency of 1630 h(-1) at 0.58 V vs RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the incorporation of pore edges results in the downshifting of the d-band center of Fe sites, which weakens the strength of the Fe-C bond when the *CO intermediate adsorbs on edge-hosted Fe-N-4, thus boosting the CO desorption and evolution rates. These findings suggest that engineering local support structure renders a way to design high-performance single-atom catalysts.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300001

However, most mechanistic studies regarding the decomposition of formic acid (FA), a promising hydrogen storage material, neglect hydrogen-bonding interactions even though FA is a strong hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor. Here, we probe the formation of bimolecular hydrogen-bonded complexes between FA and formate (FA-HCOO complexes) adsorbed on metal surfaces and how these complexes affect HCOO* decomposition. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on 12 close-packed (111)/(0001) and 8 open (100) surfaces of 12 transition metals-Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Ir, Ni, Os, Re, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru, we-show that FA-HCOO complexes are generally thermodynamically stable, even at elevated temperatures and pressures. We then illustrate that these complexes produce infrared spectroscopic signatures consistent with as yet unassigned experimental peaks. We last demonstrate that by stabilizing the dangling bond of monodentate HCOO*, these complexes significantly lower the barriers for rotation of HCOO* from a bidentate to a monodentate configuration, the rate-limiting step for HCOO* decomposition on many surfaces. FA thus acts as a cocatalyst for HCOO* decomposition. Our results may guide the community toward improved catalysts for reactions involving HCOO* such as FA decomposition, methanol steam reforming, and the water gas shift reaction.

This Perspective considers the prospects of electrocatalyst development based on a mechanism featuring the cleavage of N-2 into metal nitride complexes. By understanding the factors that control the reactivity of individual steps along the electrochemical N-2 cleavage path, opportunities for new advances are identified. Ligand design principles for facile electrochemical N-2 binding, formation of bridging N-2 complexes, thermal or photochemical N-2 cleavage, and conversion of a nitride ligand into ammonia are described, featuring recent advances and the authors' collaborative work on rhenium complexes.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300003

Psychrophilic enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures through the improved flexibility of some regions involved in the catalytic cycle. This flexibility enables an optimal conformational dynamic for the catalytic process, whose conservation in homologous enzymes that perform the same biological function has been highlighted. In this work, we demonstrated that two homologous enzymes adapted to function in niches with different temperatures exhibited different conformational dynamics. The psychrophilic bifunctional ADP-dependent PFK/GK from Methanococcoides burtonii (MbPFK/GK) shows a domain closing/opening dynamic described as a breathing-type, while its mesophilic homologue from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmPFK/GK) shows a twist-type domain closing/opening dynamic. In the psychrophilic MbPFK/GK, these conformational movements are associated with increased structural flexibility of the active site, reflected in the exponential increase of the K-m values with increasing temperature, and a greater H/D exchange of regions flanking the active site. Through sequence alignment between extant and ancestral enzymes, we identified two ion pairs outside the active site that were highly conserved in the mesophilic MmPFK/GK branch of the ADP-dependent sugar kinases family but were absent in the psychrophilic MbPFK/GK branch. Incorporation of these two ionic pairs in the psychrophilic MbPFK/GK modified the conformational dynamics of the domain closing/opening transition, the K-m dependence on temperature, and the H/D exchange, making them similar to those of its mesophilic homologue. We propose that conformational dynamics are responsible for the catalytic adaptability of this enzyme at low temperatures.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300004

One of the most promising bifunctional anode catalysts is PtRu, which has proven to be the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst in alcohol oxidation processes. While plenty of works so far have addressed the activity and mechanism of oxidation reactions on PtRu, less is known about the influence of organic fuels on the stability during operation. In this contribution, the effect of isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, formic acid, ammonia, and carbon monoxide on the stability of carbon-supported PtRu was studied both in acidic and alkaline media. The scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (online ICP-MS) technique allowed the tracking of dissolution events that occurred during the applied electrochemical protocol in real-time. Our main conclusion is that PtRu/C remained stable in the operation range of fuel cells. In addition, if the upper potential limit was further increased PtRu/C was less stable in alkaline medium in which, if compared to acidic electrolyte, approximately 4-times higher Ru and 14-times higher Pt dissolution was measured in the absence of the studied fuels. The onset potential of dissolution was not affected by the presence of fuels (except CO), while dissolution rates were notably affected, most visibly in the case of isopropanol and ammonia in alkaline media and carbon monoxide in both acidic and alkaline media. The observed phenomena are briefly discussed underlining the necessity of more detailed and mechanistic studies to fully understand the reason behind dissolution processes in the presence of the investigated fuels.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300005

Stoichiometric and catalytic carboxylation of nucleophiles, including organometallic reagents, with CO2 has been widely investigated. Since many kinds of organometallic reagents are prepared from electrophiles, transition-metal-catalyzed direct carboxylation of diverse electrophiles with CO2 has attracted much attention with high step economy and user-friendly protocols. Although significant progress has been achieved, the use of stoichiometric metallic or pyrophoric reductants is common. The renaissance of photochemistry has seen numerous efforts devoted to light-driven carboxylation with CO2, which has become one of the most active directions in this field. In this Perspective, we summarize recent advances of visible-light-driven catalytic reductive carboxylation of diverse substrates, such as unsaturated hydrocarbons, organic (pseudo)halides, and imines, with CO2 in the presence of mild electron donors, including amines, Hantzsch esters, and formates. We highlight the mechanisms of such reactions, which can proceed in the presence or absence of a photoredox catalyst or a dual visible light photoredox/transition metal catalytic system. We also discuss the future of this field and offer some insight into the challenges that remain.									38	1	0	0	3	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300006

The core-shell nanoparticle, which comprises a thin layer of catalytically active shell over a subsurface core, represents an important class of electrocatalysts. Although the internal core does not participate directly in catalysis, it influences the properties of the shell in terms of activity and stability. Furthermore, the usage of platinum-group metals (PGMs) can be greatly reduced when earth-abundant elements serve as the core materials. Thanks to these advantages, core-shell nanoparticles have attracted ever-increasing research interest. In this Perspective, we focus on recent advances of core-shell electrocatalysts constituted by earth-abundant cores and noble-metal shells. We start by discussing the factors that can influence the electrocatalytic properties of core-shell nanoparticles and move on to briefly summarize their synthetic strategies. We further discuss the core-shell electrocatalysts in terms of different core materials (low-PGM alloys, nonprecious metals, nitrides, carbides, and oxides) and showcase their electrocatalytic properties in reactions involved in water electrolysis and fuel cells. We conclude by discussing the general trends and challenges in this field.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300007

However, the high-temperature treatment typically involved during the activation of Ni-N/C catalysts makes the origin of the high activity elusive. In this work, Ni(II) phthalocyanine molecules grafted on carbon nanotube (NiPc/CNT) and heat-treated NiPc/CNT (H-NiPc/CNT) are exploited as model catalysts to investigate the impact of thermal activation on the structure of active sites and CO2RR activity. H-NiPc/CNT exhibits a similar to 4.7-fold higher turnover frequency for CO2RR to CO in comparison to NiPc/CNT. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heat treatment transforms the molecular Ni2+-N-4 sites of NiPc into Ni+-N3V (V: vacancy) and Ni+-N-3 sites incorporated in the graphene lattice that concomitantly involves breakage of Ni-N bonding, shrinkage in the Ni-N-C local structure, and decrease in the oxidation state of the Ni center from +2 to +1. DFT calculations combined with microkinetic modeling suggest that the Ni-N3V site appears to be responsible for the high CO2RR activity because of its lower barrier for the formation of * COOH intermediate and optimum *CO binding energy. In situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses further corroborate the importance of reduced Ni+ species in boosting the CO2RR activity.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300010

However, green manufacture of tartaric acid remains a grand challenge in this area. To date, chemical synthesis from nitric acid-facilitated glucose oxidation leads to only <10% yield with significant toxics as byproducts. We reported a one-pot aqueous-phase oxidation of glucose and gluconic acid using bimetallic AuPt/TiO2 catalysts in the presence of molecular O-2, with similar to 50% yield toward tartaric acid at 110 degrees C and 2 MPa. Structural characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the lattice mismatch between fcc Pt and bcc Au induces the formation of twinned boundaries in nanoclusters and Jahn-Teller distortion in an electronic field. Such structural and electronic reconfiguration leads to enhanced s-activation of the C-H bond competing with p-p electronic sharing of the C=O bond on the catalyst surface. As a result, both C-H (oxidation) and C-C (decarboxylation) bond cleavage reactions synergistically occur on the surface of bimetallic AuPt/TiO2 catalysts. Therefore, glucose and gluconic acid can be efficiently transformed into tartaric acid in a base-free medium. Lattice distortion-enhanced reconfiguration of the electronic field in Pt-based bimetallic nanocatalysts can be utilized in many other energy and environmental fields for catalyzing synergistic oxidation reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300011

Until recently, catalysis with biohybrid catalysts has been performed exclusively in aqueous solutions to maintain the structural integrity of protein scaffolds. Here, we present the incorporation of a biohybrid catalyst into a synthetic polymer film. Ferric hydroxamate uptake protein component A (FhuA), a beta-barrel protein, is copolymerized with N-methylpyrrole by electrochemical polymerization. Covalent incorporation of an artificial cofactor into the "stacked barrels" of FhuA gives a catalytic biocomposite enabling ring-closing olefin metathesis in neat substrates.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300012

However, few natural ketone reductases (KREDs) or alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHs) with high activity and stereoselectivity toward bulky-bulky ketones have yet been reported due to the strong steric hindrance of these substrates. Recent developments in protein engineering have led to biocatalysts capable of producing chiral alcohols with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. This review discusses recent advances in several approaches for the manipulation of stereoselectivity, including engineering of the binding pocket and active site loops to accommodate bulky-bulky ketones, modulating the electronic effects on attraction and repulsion between binding pocket residues and substituents of ketone substrates, and adding traceless directing groups to substrates to alter their orientation. Microbial sources of KREDs and ADHs, screening techniques, and future outlooks for the field are also discussed.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300013

In this work, the coordination state and number of active sites ("Co-Mo-S") in sulfided CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts prepared with and without chelating additives were determined using in situ 1s2p resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Based on the evaluation of thiophene HDS activity as a function of the Co/Mo ratio, it was determined that only for Co/Mo < 0.1, cobalt is exclusively in interaction with the MoS2 phase, making these compositions ideal for identifying the nature of the active cobalt sites for hydrogenolysis. These cobalt promoter atoms were in centrosymmetric coordination with the MoS2 phase, with six sulfur ligands coordinated to each cobalt center. The octahedral coordination of cobalt in Co-Mo-S in alumina-supported HDS catalysts contrasts the tetrahedral cobalt coordination found in Co-promoted MoS2 model systems supported on gold or carbon. We attribute the difference to more disordered MoS2 structures in technical alumina-supported HDS catalysts. The number of Co-Mo-S sites depended strongly on the catalyst preparation method. Chelating additives, such as citric acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, increased the number of Co-Mo-S sites without significantly altering their intrinsic activity. These results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art structural characterization tools, such as RIXS, identify the structure of active sites in actual catalysts and that these structures may be different from model systems. Combining such characterization tools with guided catalyst design can provide an insight into the structure of amorphous, nanostructured materials, which aid in the development of improved heterogeneous catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300015

It is found that PA and MeByOH give rise to strong surface sensitivities in relation to both hydrogenation activity and molecular fragmentation into adsorbed species such as CO. For PA, irreversible adsorption is strongly favored for Pt{100} and Pt{110} but is weak in the case of Pt{111}. It is suggested that the presence of the primary alcohol substituent is key to this behavior, with the order of surface reactivity being Pt{100} > Pt{110} > Pt{111}. In contrast, for MeByOH, strong irreversible adsorption is observed on all three basal plane Pt surfaces and we propose that this reflects the enhanced activity of the alkyne moiety arising from the inductive effect of the two methyl groups, coupled with the decreased activity of the tertiary alcohol substituent toward fragmentation. Pt{111} also exhibits singular behavior in relation to MeByOH hydrogenation in that a sharp Raman band at 1590 cm(-1) is observed corresponding to the formation of a di-sigma/pi-bonded surface complex as the alkyne adsorbs. This band frequency is some 20 cm(-1) higher than the analogous broadband observed for PA and MeByOH adsorbed on all other basal plane Pt surfaces and may be viewed as a fingerprint of Pt{111} terraces being present at a catalyst surface undergoing hydrogenation. Insights into the hydrogenation activity of different Pt{hkl} surfaces are obtained using quantitative comparisons between Raman bands at hydrogenation potentials and at 0.4 V vs Pd/H, the beginning of the double-layer potential region, and it is asserted (with support from CV) that Pt{110} is the most active plane for hydrogenation due to the presence of surface defects generated via the lifting of the (1 x 2) to (1 x 1) clean surface reconstruction following flame annealing and hydrogen cooling. Our findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that Pt{111} planes are most likely to provide semihydrogenation selectivity of alkynes to alkenes, as reported previously.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300017	33042608

So far, with the development in synthetic methodologies and characterization techniques, SMCs with fine structures could be constructed and well-defined at the atomic level. In addition, based on computational modeling of SMCs, theoretical calculations corroborated well with experimental results, providing in-depth insights into the structure-property relationship for SMCs in catalysis. In this Review, classic synthetic strategies and key characterization techniques of SMCs are summarized. Subsequently, the applications of SMCs in important catalytic reactions based on recent studies are discussed, including aerobic oxidation, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, and photocatalytic reactions. In particular, the importance of the cluster size-effect and metal-support interactions in determining the catalytic performance of SMCs is highlighted.

In this work, we report that 2-mercaptothiazole and other analogues are active for the metal-free borylation of heterocycles and terminal alkynes. Alkynes are challenging substrates to C-H borylate because they undergo side reactions with most borylating agents. The ability of these metal-free catalysts to activate B-C bonds can also be translated to the activation of B-O bonds in the products of the 1,4-conjugate addition of alkynylboranes to chalcones. It is therefore possible to prepare beta-alkynylketones from the corresponding alkynes in a process where the boron source is used in substoichiometric amounts.

In this work, we employ an unbiased density functional global optimization strategy to identify the locations and energetic barriers for migration pathways between sites for platinum (Pt) confined within the microporous volume of a purely silicious zeolite with Linde type A topology and its aluminosilicate and borosilicate variants. We observe an impressive stabilization of single Pt atoms caused by a hitherto unreported binding mode, in which the six rings in the framework are broken, leading to trapped, highly accessible metal centers. In addition, heteroatom substituents are found to significantly enhance the incorporation of Pt via an unexpected insertion into framework SiO-H bonds. Migration of Pt is hindered by high barriers, which are predicted to vary significantly with Si:X (X = Al and B) ratios. It is proposed that an optimal Si:X ratio exists for a given zeolite topology, in which the barriers will reach the maximum value. The energetic preference for Pt clustering (via Ostwald ripening) remains but is significantly reduced with respect to isolated clusters because of the strong interactions between Pt atoms and the framework. Our findings suggest a means to control noble-metal particle sintering, despite a thermodynamic driving force toward Pt clustering. This work provides an explanation for the surprisingly high degree of kinetic stability of ultrasmall, encapsulated metal particles observed experiment.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300020

The abundance of pyridinic coordination sites in this host permits the adsorption of copper iodide from the reaction medium. The key to achieving high activity is to confine active Cu species on the surface, which is accomplished by introducing atomically dispersed metal dopants to block diffusion into the bulk of the carrier. The alternative route of incorporating metal during the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride is ineffective as Cu is thermodynamically more stable in inactive subsurface positions. A combination of X-ray absorption, X-ray photoelectron, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, density functional theory, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations is employed to determine the location and associated geometry as well as the electronic structure of metal centers. N-Arylation activity correlates to the surface coverage by copper, which varies during the reaction due to an interplay between site formation via adsorption from the reaction medium and deactivation by diffusion into the bulk of the material, and is highest when an Fe dopant is used to hinder such movement through the lattice.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300021

Exploring catalysts with high efficiency, low-cost, and high stability is an important issue for the research of heterogeneous catalysis. In recent years, researchers have prepared a variety of defective catalysts and found that the defects in catalysts have an important effect on their catalytic activity. However, the relationship between defects and catalytic activity remains to be clarified. In this Review, three aspects including recognition, understanding, and utilization for defect chemistry in heterogeneous catalysis have been proposed. Based on recent progress, this work mainly introduces the fundamental concept, types, and characterization of defects in catalysts, significant effects of defects on catalytic properties, and controllable construction methods of defects for efficient catalyst synthesis. Finally, the conclusion and outlook for the research of defect chemistry in heterogeneous catalysis are presented. It is hoped that this work can provide guidance for the controllable synthesis and mechanism research of defective heterogeneous catalysts.									44	1	0	0	5	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300023

Herein, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with ab initio FEFF calculations rule out specific adsorption of AM(+) and hydroxyl (OHad) but not interfacial water with the oxygen facing toward the Pt surface (H2O down arrow(ad)) within the hydrogen underpotential deposition (H-UPD) potential region in alkaline solutions. We further show that AM(+) greatly affects the H-UPD peaks and the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) of Pt in alkaline solutions. We accordingly propose that H2O down arrow(ad) is specifically adsorbed on undercoordinated Pt surfaces and bonded with the water molecules coordinated to AM(+), forming the sandwich structure of Pt-H2O down arrow(ad)center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) across the interface; and the exchange between the H2O down arrow(ad)center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) and Had yields the sharp H-UPD peaks. The AM(+) weakens the Pt-H2O down arrow(ad) bond via noncovalent interactions and in turn positively shifts the H-UPD peaks and hinders the HOR by delaying the oxidative removal of H-ad. The AM(+) promotes the HER of Pt by facilitating the removal of the OHad in the form of OHad center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) subsequent to the dissociation of H2O down arrow(ad).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300024

A Theoretical Study of the Kemp Elimination Catalyzed by a Promiscuous Aldoxime Dehydratase								ACS CATALYSIS				10	19			11110	11119		10.1021/acscatal.0c02215				OCT 2 2020	2020	The design of biocatalysts is a goal to improve the rate, selectivity, and environmental friendliness of chemical processes in biotechnology. In this regard, the use of computational techniques has provided valuable assistance in the design of enzymes with remarkable catalytic activity. In this paper, hybrid QM/MM simulations have allowed getting an insight into the mechanism of a promiscuous aldoxime dehydratase (OxdA) for Kemp elimination. We first demonstrate that, based on the use of linear response approximation (LRA) methods, the lowest energy electronic state of the benzisoxazole placed in the active site of OxdA corresponds to a singlet state, the triplet and the quintet states being higher in energy. The presence of a heme group at the active site of the OxdA promiscuous enzyme opens the possibility of exploring a redox mechanism, similar to the one proposed in other reactions catalyzed by heme-dependent enzymes. In addition, according to the geometrical analysis of the active site of this aldoxime dehydratase, the presence of a good base in the active site, His320, the proper pose of the substrate assisted by the porphyrin, and an adequate electrostatic environment to stabilize the negative charge developed in the oxygen-leaving group makes available an acid/base mechanism. Comparison of the results derived from the exploration of both acid/base and redox mechanisms at the B3LYP(Def2-TZVP)/MM level shows how the latter renders the most favorable reaction path within the quintet state. The obtained activation free energy is in good agreement with the activation energy that can be deduced from the experimentally measured rate constant.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300025

As one of the most promising OER catalysts, NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can be rationally tailored via defect engineering to achieve enhanced catalytic performance. Herein, we report a fluoride precovered surface strategy to manipulate the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites of NiFe LDH catalysts. The adsorption of fluoride is introduced during the crystallization process with flexible amount, and the precovered fluoride can be easily removed by electrochemical treatment, leaving a controllable density of unsaturated metal sites with high activity toward OER. Specifically, NiFe LDH with an optimized amount of fluoride precovered demonstrates an overpotential of 243 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, with a reduced Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), exhibiting enhanced catalytic performance than pristine NiFe LDH. Such a precovered surface strategy can effectively manipulate the density of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites and has great potential in catalyst design with high performance via defect engineering.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300027

LinD is a cofactor-independent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible (de)hydration of the tertiary alcohol (S)-linalool to the triene beta-myrcene and also its isomerization to the primary alcohol geraniol. Structure-informed mutagenesis of LinD, followed by activity studies, confirmed essential roles for residues C171, C180, and H129 in water activation for the hydration of beta-myrcene to linalool. However, no evidence of covalent thioterpene intermediates was found using either X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, or QM/MM nudged elastic band simulations. Labeling and NMR experiments confirmed a role for residue D39 in (de)protonation of the linalool carbon C10 in the isomerization of linalool to geraniol and also the intermediacy of beta-myrcene in this isomerization reaction. X-ray, molecular dynamics, and activity studies also suggested a significant role in catalysis for a mobile methionine residue M125, which exists in substantially altered orientations in different mutant structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300028

Direct coupling of light-absorbing semiconductor nanocrystals to MoFe protein enables NH3 production from photoexcited electron transfer, replacing Fe protein. Production of H-2 and NH3 was measured for CdS quantum dot (QD) MoFe protein complexes illuminated under different excitation rates. N-15-labeling of NH3 production combined with background-corrected H-2 production enabled determination of MoFe protein catalysis products. The turnover rates of H-2 and NH3 increased with excitation rate, with distinct kinetic responses that show the electron demand for NH3 requires higher excitation rates to overcome the more favored H-2 production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300029

The gram-scale hydrogenation could be proceeded well with >99% ee in the presence of low catalyst loading (up to 3350 TON). This Ni-catalyzed hydrogenation protocol demonstrated great synthetic utility, and the chiral 2-oxazolidinone product was easily converted to a variety of other important molecules in good yields and without loss of ee values, such as chiral dihydrothiophene-2(3H)-thione, amino alcohol, oxazoline ligand, and allenamide. Moreover, a series of deuterium labeling experiments, control experiments, and DFT calculations were conducted to illustrate a reasonable catalytic mechanism for this Ni-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation, which involved a tautomerization between the enamine and its isomer imine and then went through asymmetric 1,2-addition of Ni(II)-H to the preferred imine.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300030

Although they have been thoroughly studied for years, building a true enzyme mimic remains a challenging and necessary task. Here, we show how a three-dimensional geometry analysis of the key catalytic residues in natural hydrolases has been exploited to design and synthesize small-molecule artificial enzymes which mimic the active centers of chymotrypsin and N-terminal hydrolases. The optimized prototype catalyzes the methanolysis of the acyl enzyme mimic with a half-life of only 3.7 min at 20 degrees C, and it is also able to perform the transesterification of vinyl acetate at room temperature. DFT studies and X-ray diffraction analysis of the catalyst bound to a transition state analogue proves the similarity with the geometry of natural hydrolases.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300031

ACS CATALYSIS				10	19			11177	11234		10.1021/acscatal.0c01862				OCT 2 2020	2020	Water splitting through the use of (photo)electrocatalysts is a carbon-free route to sustainably produce hydrogen gas for use in various applications, such as ammonia and methanol synthesis, hydrotreating of petroleum and biomass, and clean electricity production in fuel cells. Over the past few decades, many candidate materials (e.g., metals and their oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and phosphides) in various 2D and 3D architectures and structures (e.g., layered double hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, rutiles, spinels, and perovskites) have been evaluated for catalyzing the two half-reactions involved in water splitting: hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Moreover, these materials are used under varied operating conditions, such as low and high temperatures, pressures, and solution pH, and in the presence or absence of sunlight. Accordingly, it is valuable to examine why the materials and process conditions currently in use were explored in the first place and why some of them are more promising than others. Given the difficulties associated with experimentally characterizing electrode-electrolyte interfaces in situ, theory can be a valuable partner for gaining insight into intermediate structures, reaction mechanisms, and ultimately catalyst design. Here, we focus on how theoretical studies of crucial materials properties, such as optoelectronic properties (e.g., band gaps, band edge positions, and the kinetics of charge-carrier separation and transport), adsorption and reaction energetics, and (photo)electrochemical stability, inform the success of existing and yet-to-be-discovered (photo)electrocatalysts. We also highlight other research directions important for theoretical (photo)electrocatalyst discovery, such as the quantification of reaction kinetics versus thermodynamics, investigation of the influence of defects and surface reconstructions on (photo)electrocatalytic materials properties, and the use of data science strategies (e.g., high-throughput simulations, statistical regression, and machine learning) to accelerate the development of new materials for water splitting applications.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300033

The nature and abundance of Ni species in these samples are characterized by X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, and CO chemisorption. The bulk synthesis methods (i.e., CP and CS) produce Ni cations that are incorporated into the CZ lattice forming mixed-metal oxides with Ni3+ species at low Ni content. The formation of mixed-metal oxides increases the reducibility of CZ and increases the abundance of active surface oxygen. All NiO/CZ catalysts are active for methane dry reforming and retain some of their activity at a steady state. The initial methane conversion correlates linearly with the fraction of accessible Ni after reduction. The predominant path of catalyst deactivation strongly depends on the structure of the catalyst and, thus, on the synthesis method used. All catalysts experience agglomeration of Ni particles under reaction conditions. Improving the Ni dispersion to isolated species embedded in a support does not improve resistance to Ni particle growth. Coke formation is inversely related to the concentration of active surface oxygen. The dominant deactivation mechanism for catalysts made by CS is the encapsulation of Ni particles by the support.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300034

It is activated by a ligand-gated conformational change that is necessary for the enzyme to reach a catalytically competent conformation capable of efficient transition-state stabilization. While the human form (hlGPDH) has been the subject of extensive structural and biochemical studies, corresponding computational studies to support and extend experimental observations have been lacking. We perform here detailed empirical valence bond and Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type hlGPDH and its variants, as well as providing a crystal structure of the binary hlGPDH center dot NAD R269A variant where the enzyme is present in the open conformation. We estimated the activation free energies for the hydride transfer reaction in wild-type and substituted hlGPDH and investigated the effect of mutations on catalysis from a detailed structural study. In particular, the K120A and R269A variants increase both the volume and solvent exposure of the active site, with concomitant loss of catalytic activity. In addition, the R269 side chain interacts with both the Q295 side chain on the catalytic loop, and the substrate phosphodianion. Our structural data and simulations illustrate the critical role of this side chain in facilitating the closure of hlGPDH into a catalytically competent conformation, through modulating the flexibility of a key catalytic loop (292-LNGQKL-297). This, in turn, rationalizes a tremendous 41,000 fold decrease experimentally in the turnover number, k(cat), upon truncating this residue, as loop closure is essential for both correct positioning of key catalytic residues in the active site, as well as sequestering the active site from the solvent. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of this ligand-gated conformational change in catalysis, a feature that can be exploited both for protein engineering and for the design of allosteric inhibitors targeting this biomedically important enzyme.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300035	33042609

Here, a highly active and more economical composite catalyst composed of Cu-promoted Fe2O3 (nCu-Fe2O3) and HZSM-5 was developed for the selective conversion of CO2 to aromatics with 56.61% selectivity at a single pass. An extremely low CO selectivity of 3.51 at 57.30% CO2 conversion outperforming the previously reported conversion was achieved because of the beneficial synergism between Cu and Fe and the distinctive CO reduction prior to reaction which is favorable to the formation of oxygen vacancies for CO2 adsorption and iron carbide for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Additionally, through integrating HZSM-5 synthesized by the phase-transfer method (HZSM-5-pt) with nCu-Fe2O3, the distribution of benzene, toluene, and xylene in aromatics can be noteworthily increased to 54.18% and aromatics selectivity can be increased to 61.94%, without depression of catalyst activity. More significantly, a "H recycling" mechanism was found between oxide and zeolite, which plays a crucial role in "the disposal of H" within dehydrogenative aromatization, facilitating the formation of aromatics. In summary, nCu-Fe2O3/HZSM-5 demonstrates a prospective industrial application in aromatics production from CO2.Y									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300036

Recently, HEAs have already exhibited remarkable catalytic performance toward several thermal-driven and electrocatalytic reactions. HEAs not only regulate the electronic and geometric structures to a large degree but also serve as a platform to construct catalysts with unexpected performance. Herein, recent advances regarding HEA-based catalysis are systematically summarized, with a special focus on the synthetic methods for HEA-based catalysts, catalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding. Moreover, the challenges and future opportunities for this research area are carefully discussed. A series of open questions and promising directions to be explored are proposed, including synthetic methods, regulation of electronic properties, identification of active centers, and applications into photocatalysis.

A big challenge is to identify catalysts able to achieve high conversion and selectivity. Here, we report an In2O3-supported Au catalyst that exhibits excellent performance for hydrogenation of CO2 selectively to methanol. In situ characterizations using time-resolved X-ray diffraction, ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm that a strong metal-support interaction leads to a reactive Au delta+-In2O3-x interface for activation and hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. An effective gold-indium oxide bonding favors the dispersion of the noble metal and prevents its sintering under reaction conditions. The methanol selectivity reaches 100% at temperatures below 225 degrees C and is more than 70% at 275 degrees C over the Au delta+-In2O3-x catalyst. It is even 67.8% with a space time yield of methanol of 0.47 gMeOH/(h.g(cat)) at 300 degrees C, 5 MPa, and 21,000 cm(3) h(-1) g(cat)(-1). The results obtained here represent the highest selectivity and activity ever reported for CO2 hydrogenation over supported gold catalysts. Our study shows that the strong Au/In2O3 interaction and the intrinsic chemical activity of In2O3 can be used to significantly improve the catalytic performance of Au catalysts, providing promising routes for the rational design and application of Au catalysts beyond CO2 hydrogenation.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300038

Among the available CO2-recycling options, catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is the most realistic and attractive choice if the hydrogen is produced using a renewable energy source. Depending on the nature of the catalyst, CO2 hydrogenation has distinct reaction pathways, and various value-added hydrocarbons can be produced. Intense research has recently developed high-performance catalysts, identified clear reaction pathways, and deepened the understanding of the reaction mechanisms. In this review, we present an overview of recent key advances in catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to high-value hydrocarbons and oxygenates that have large market sizes, such as formic acid, methanol, methane, and light olefins, as well as liquid fuels, in terms of the catalyst design, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. In addition, the current technical challenges and perspectives on CO2 conversion processes are discussed with regard to climate change mitigation.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300039

Conventional DODH reactions usually take place at a single-site MOx (M = Re, Mo, V, etc.) active center, which proceed through a diol condensation step, an alkene extrusion step, and a catalyst regeneration (or reduction) step. Here, we suggest that MoS2-supported transition-metal atoms allow for the DODH reaction to occur through an alternative mechanism, whereby the C-H bond of a diol is activated first, which facilitates the C-OH bond cleavage on a neighboring carbon. The removal of the second OH group is also facile over the proposed catalysts. Our kinetic studies suggest that the DODH of ethylene glycol on Ru-2/MoS2, Ir-2/MoS2, and Ru-3/MoS2 is highly active with predicted turnover frequencies of over 1/s. Thus, our study suggests a possible approach for the design of highly active DODH catalysts. Apart from being a DODH catalyst, the proposed MoS2-supported catalysts are also highly active as the hydrodeoxygenation catalyst for the removal of alcohol OH groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300040

Herein, the active sites for low-temperature CO oxidation are elucidated over single-atom Pd-1/CeO2 catalysts prepared via high-temperature atom trapping (AT). The increased oxygen vacancies on CeO2 surface induced by 800 degrees C air calcination result in decreased Pd-CeO2 coordinations, i.e., the coordination-unsaturated Pd2+ on CeO2. Light-off and light-out measurements coupled with CO-DRIFTS and X-ray absorption characterization confirm that these coordination-unsaturated Pd2+ on CeO2 are much more reactive than the fully coordinated counterpart, evidenced by a decrease of T-90 (temperature to achieve 90% conversion) by similar to 100 degrees C in CO oxidation at a gas hourly space velocity of 300 L g(-1) h(-1).									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300041

A bifunctional nickel, iron-nanomesh array electrocatalyst has been developed characteristic of excellent structural features for favorable NRR and OER processes, including highly exposed active sites originated from sub-nanometer-thick nanomeshes, hierarchical porosity resulting from the array-arranged nanolayers, and binary nickel, iron active sites. The electrode demonstrates excellent NRR activity with an ammonia yield of 16.89 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.50% at -350 mV (vs RHE), in addition to OER activity with a small overpotential of 191 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). Consequently, a full N-2 electrolysis system has been constructed that exhibits remarkable ammonia production performance with an ammonia yield of 2.07 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) at 1.9 V, an FE of 9.87% at 1.6 V, and good durability for 30 h. Further mechanism study through density function theory shows that the NRR proceeds via an associative distal pathway, whereas the free energies for the N-2* -> NNH* intermediate step in the NRR as well as the OH* + H2O -> O* + H2O intermediate step in the OER can be reduced by tuning the catalysts electronic structure by the strong synergistic effect between nickel and iron.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300043

To overcome this challenge, in this study, we designed and prepared a nanoparticulate (Pd1-xPtx)In pseudobinary alloy using Al2O3 and CeO2 supports, where a portion of Pd was replaced with Pt to improve the oxidation tolerance of In during NOx reduction under lean conditions. Multiple characterization techniques were used to confirm the formation of the desired pseudobinary alloy phase. The prepared Pd-Pt-In/CeO2 catalyst exhibited high NO conversion to N-2 in NO-CO-O-2 reaction with a wide range of oxygen concentrations including lean conditions (80%-100%, 0.75 <= lambda <= 1.5, 350 degrees C) and retained its catalytic performance during rich-lean cycles.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300044

A Pd(II) complex 1 featuring aPmic catalyzes the oxidation of a wide range of terminal olefins to the corresponding methyl ketones in good to excellent yields in acetonitrile. The catalytic reaction is proposed to proceed via syn-peroxypalladation and a subsequent rate-limiting 1,2-hydride shift, which is supported by kinetic studies. The electronic asymmetry of aPmic renders a well-defined coordination sphere at Pd. The favored arrangement of reactants on the metal center features an olefin trans to the pyridyl module and a tbutylperoxide trans to the carbene. This arrangement gains added stability by the pi-delocalization paved by the compatible orbitals on Pd, the pyridyl module, and the olefin that is perpendicular to the Pd(aPmic) plane. The pi-interactions are absent in an alternate arrangement wherein the olefin is trans to the carbene. Density functional theory studies reveal the matching orbital overlaps responsible for the preferred arrangement over the other. This work provides an orbital description for the electronic asymmetry of aPmic.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300045

A general and also strong "axial oxy group effect" was now observed with benzoyl cyanide as the acylating agent and 4-dimethylaminopyridine as the catalyst, permitting the preferred O-acylation of equatorial hydroxy groups next to axial oxy groups. This effect is substantiated with 2,3-O-unprotected beta-D-galacto- and alpha-D-glucopyranosides and 3,4-O-unprotected mannopyranosides possessing vicinal trans-diol moieties. Moreover, vicinal trans-diols with axial oxy groups next to each hydroxy group, possessing expectedly comparable reactivity, could be differentiated with chiral tertiary amine catalysts. Particularly interesting in this regard is the action of bifunctional (S,S)-N-(N,N-dialkylaminocyclohexyl)-thioureas as catalysts; they favor 2-O-benzoylation of 2,3-O-unprotected alpha-galactopyranosides, as is also supported by density functional theory calculations. This directing effect can be reversed with quinidine as the catalyst or with bulky substituents at the anomeric position.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300048

Herein, we report a remarkable achievement of both hydrogen generation activity and durability by atomically engineering Pt-PdO interfacial sites. A combination of kinetics (isotopic) analyses, multiple characterization techniques, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculations was employed to reveal the evolution of the Pt-Pd atomic structure where Pd segregates to the outer surface of Pt nanoparticles, followed by partial oxidation, resulting in the structure of a Pt-rich core and a PdO-Pd-rich shell. The strong capability of PdO to activate H2O compensates for its adverse effects on Pt electronic properties and creates the Pt and PdO interfacial sites for ammonia borane and H2O activation, respectively. Moreover, because of the strong electron repulsion and steric hindrance effects, these surface PdO sites strongly inhibit the adsorption of B(OH)(4)(-), thus protecting Pt active sites from poisoning. As a result, such a unique atomic structure with a Pt-Pd ratio of 1:1 is found to be the most promising catalyst at the apex of the volcano curve. The strategy developed here unambiguously clarifies the activity and durability attributes of Pt-PdO interfacial sites for this reaction and sheds light on the design of a new type of highly active yet stable metal catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300049

By combining Vaska's complex-catalyzed tertiary amide reductive activation and photochemical single electron reduction into a streamlined tandem process, metastable hemiaminal intermediates were successfully transformed into nucleophilic alpha-amino free radical species. This umpolung approach to such reactive intermediates was exemplified through coupling with an electrophilic dehydroalanine acceptor, resulting in the synthesis of an array of a-functionalized tertiary amine derivatives, previously inaccessible from the amide starting materials. The utility of the strategy was expanded to include secondary amide substrates, intramolecular variants, and late-stage functionalization of an active pharmaceutical ingredient.

Radical conjugate addition provides an avenue for replacing reactive nucleophiles with convenient radical precursors. Carboxylic acids can serve as simple and stable radical precursors by way of decarboxylation, but activation to reactive esters is typically necessary to facilitate the challenging decarboxylation. Here, we report a direct, dual-catalytic decarboxylative radical conjugate addition of a wide range of carboxylic acids that does not require acid preactivation and is enabled by the visible light-driven acridine photocatalysis interfaced with an efficient copper catalytic cycle. Mechanistic and computational studies provide insights into the roles of the ligands and metal species in the dual-catalytic process and the photocatalytic activity of substituted acridines.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300052

We focus on two unexplored/"gray" events: (a) the O-2 entrance and binding to form the oxyferrous species as a function of the O-2 concentration/pressure and (b) the protonation steps that eventually lead to the formation of the ultimate active species, compound I (cf. 7). Two fundamental and paradigm-shifting findings emerge: (a) the O-2 concentration/pressure required for O-2 binding must be neither high nor low. The binding is ushered by substrate choreography, which is guided by the moderate O-2 pressure and strategic protein residues (Arg112 and Phe87) that block the substrate approach to the heme, thus enabling O-2 accumulation near iron. (b) The formation of water channels, which elicit that the protonation steps are different for 5 -> 6 and 6 -> 7. The process 5. 6, generating the ferric hydroperoxide, occurs via the channels that are formed by breakage of the salt bridges holding the propionate side chains of the porphyrin, while the formation of compound I, 6 -> 7, transpires via the traditional acid-alcohol pairs (Asp251/Thr252 in CAM; Glu267/Thr268 in BM3). The location of acidic ammonium groups (Lys69 in CYP450(BM3) and Arg299 in CYP450(CAM)) near the propionate side chains is generally conserved in the CYP450 family. Therefore, our study highlights the evolutionary need for at least two alternative water channels to tune the P450 nanomachine, so it can complete the two steps of the protonation and form ultimately compound I.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300055

In this work, four CeO2 supports with structurally well-defined different shapes and crystal facets are hydrothermally prepared, and their effects on the composition of Pd species and oxygen vacancy over Pd/CeO2 catalysts have been intensively investigated in the reduction of CO2 to methanol. The 2Pd/CeO2-R (rods) shows the highest concentration and number of oxygen vacancies, where the (110) facet with high surface oxygen mobility and low oxygen vacancy formation energy is exposed over the CeO2-R surface. The oxygen mobility at the interface of (111) and (100) facets mainly observed on 2Pd/CeO2-P (polyhedrons) is higher than the single (111) and (100) facets mainly observed on 2Pd/CeO2-O (octahedrons) and 2Pd/CeO2-C (cubs), respectively. The presence of Pd highly promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies by providing dissociated H atoms to facilitate the removal of surface O in ceria support under a H-2 atmosphere. Both the PdxCe1-xO delta solid solution dominated on CeO2-R and the PdO species dominated on CeO2-O are reduced to metallic Pd after reduction with 6-10 nm average particle size. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in contrast to the single Pd-0 atom on CeO2 and the thermodynamically most unstable PdxCe1-xO delta solid solution, the Pd-0 nanoparticles are the most stable species under the realistic reaction conditions. The 2Pd/CeO2-R shows the highest catalytic activity as the abundantly available oxygen vacancies function as CO2 adsorption and activation sites. Moreover, oxygen vacancy reactivity is correlated with its formation energy. The lower formation energy facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancy; however, the reactivity of each oxygen vacancy is lower as the TOFoxygen vacancy of 2Pd/CeO2-O is 15 times as that of 2Pd/CeO2-R. Thus, a suitable oxygen vacancy formation energy is likely favorable for enhancing CO2 reactivity. DFT calculations indicate that the CH3OH formation is most probably from the formate (HCOO*) pathway via the C-O bond cleavage in H2COOH*, with the reduction of HCOO* to HCOOH* as the rate-limiting step. These results would provide experimental and theoretical insights into the rational design of an effective catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation.									27	2	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300056

Using advanced spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and electrochemically active surface area characterization techniques, the electronic structure and the changes in the morphology/roughness of thermally oxidized copper thin films were revealed during CO2RR. For this purpose, we developed an in situ cell for X-ray spectroscopy that could be operated accurately in the presence of gases or liquids to clarify the role of the initial thermal oxide phase and its active phase during the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. It was found that the Cu(I) species formed during the thermal treatment are readily reduced to Cu-0 during the CO2RR, whereas Cu(II) species are hardly reduced. In addition, Cu(II) oxide electrode dissolution was found to yield a porous/void structure, where the lack of electrical connection between isolated islands prohibits the CO2RR. Therefore, the active/stable phase for CO2RR is metallic copper, independent of its initial phase, with a significant change in its morphology upon its reduction yielding the formation of a rougher surface with a higher number of underco-ordinated sites. Thus, the initial thermal oxidation of copper in air controls the reaction activity/selectivity because of the changes induced in the electrode surface morphology/roughness and the presence of more undercoordinated sites during the CO2RR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300057	33042610

This method uses RhCl3 salt as the catalyst precursor and avoids the use of co-oxidants such as Cu(II). The use of dioxygen as the in situ oxidant gives water as the only byproduct of the alkenylation reaction. Conditions to achieve >1000 turnovers of alkenyl benzene products have been developed. As the catalysis progresses, oxidation of styrene product to form benzaldehyde becomes competitive. Compared to the Rh catalysis using Cu(II) oxidants, the aerobic reactions give decreased reaction rate and reduced anti-Markovnikov/Markovnikov selectivity when using alpha-olefins. For styrene formation, the reaction rate shows a first-order dependence on catalyst concentration, ethylene concentration (with saturation at higher ethylene concentrations), and dioxygen. An intermolecular kinetic isotope effect value of 2.7(6) was determined from parallel reactions with C6H6 versus C6D6. Synthesis of trans-stilbene and pentenyltoluenes has been demonstrated using this Rh-catalyzed aerobic alkenylation reaction.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300058

In this study, we investigated in detail the role of the Cu-CeO2 interactions for methanol synthesis, emphasizing the role of the copper surface and interface sites between copper and ceria for the hydrogenation of CO2 and CO. A combined CO2-N2O titration approach was developed to quantify the exposed metallic copper sites and ceria oxygen vacancies in reduced Cu/CeO2 catalysts. Extensive characterization shows that copper dispersion is strongly enhanced by strong Cu-CeO2 interactions in comparison to Cu/SiO2. CO2 hydrogenation activity data show that the Cu/CeO2 catalysts displayed higher methanol selectivity compared to a reference Cu/SiO2 catalyst. The improved methanol selectivity stems from inhibition of the reverse water-gas-shift activity. The role of CO in CO2-to-methanol conversion was studied by steady-state and transient cofeeding activity measurements together with (quasi) in situ characterization (TPH, XPS, SSITKA, and IR spectroscopy). The Cu-CeO2 interface provides active sites for the direct hydrogenation of CO to methanol via a formyl intermediate. Cofeeding of small amounts of CO2 to a CO/H-2 mixture poisons these interfacial sites due to the formation of carbonate-like species. Methanol synthesis proceeds mainly via CO2 hydrogenation in which the metallic Cu surface provides the active sites.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300059

Herein, we investigate the regeneration of Sn-containing zeolites for the continuous conversion of glucose. In doing so, we reveal that permanent changes to the properties of the catalyst occur following continuous operation and regeneration, resulting in surprising improvements to performance during subsequent operational cycles. Through a combination of characterization (Sn-119 CPMG MAS NMR, DRIFTS, and vapor sorption) and kinetic methodologies, we reveal that improved performance arises from restructuring of the catalyst, which causes the active-site environment to become more accessible, more hydrophobic, more reactive, and more stable. Based on these findings, we demonstrate how these positive changes can be emulated without resorting to extended operation, by optimizing pretreatment of the catalyst prior to reaction. This process, termed preactivation, involves treatment of the fresh catalyst in a flow of methanol at 110 degrees C for 0.5 h, prior to its heat treatment at 550 degrees C in air for 3 h. This relatively rapid procedure allows substantial improvements to catalyst activity and stability to be achieved in a permanent fashion prior to the first operational cycle.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300060

Within this realm, 80% of reactions are carried out by heterogeneous catalysts due to their advantageous physical and chemical characteristics. In some heterogeneous systems, the reaction rate can be optimized through rational catalyst design, in which support materials can be tailored structurally and stereoelectronically for targeted purposes to better facilitate the catalytic reaction. To this end, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered recent attention due to their high porosity, crystallinity, and chemical tunability, which can be used to derive structure-activity relationships in the design of catalysts. In this Perspective, we survey examples of catalytically active guest metals on the inorganic nodes of MOFs. This is done with the intention of providing design guidelines for tailoring chemical reactivity and insights into the opportunities for future growth in this field. Strategies for rational design in MOF catalysis include electronic tuning of the metal node in the MOF support, installing promoter ions onto the node to effect the reactivity of grafted metals, modulation of the spatial environment around the transition metal using the metal node structure, and achieving site uniformity in supported catalysts. By highlighting these efforts, we seek to underscore the role of MOF nodes as nonspectator supports for catalytic metal complexes and provide future directions for rational catalyst design by tuning reactivity on these anchoring platforms.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300061

Alkoxyiminium chlorides and hexafluorophosphates were synthesized and characterized as a key intermediate of the catalytic cycle. The determination of reaction orders and control experiments indicated that the nucleophilic attack of the formamide catalyst onto the reagent BzCl is the rate-determining step. Linear free energy relationship revealed a correlation between the quantified Lewis basicity strength of formamides by means of B-11 NMR spectroscopy and their catalytic activity in S-N-transformations. The observed difference in catalytic ability was attributed to the natural bond order charge, dipole moment, and Sterimol parameter B-5. Importantly, this rationalization enables the prediction of the capacity of formamides to promote S-N-type transformations in general.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300062

However, the design and synthesis of high-performance nonprecious metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction are still confronted with challenges because of their high overpotential and poor flexibility. We herein reported in situ formed bimetallic carbide Ni6Mo6C nanodot and NiMoOx nanosheet array hybrid electrocatalyst supported on activated carbon cloth (Ni6Mo6C/NiMoOx/ACC), which is manufactured by controlling the diffusion of carbon atoms into precursor NiMoO4 nanosheets from activated carbon cloth to produce active species bimetallic carbide during annealing in a H-2 atmosphere. The unique hierarchical structure of NiMoOx nanosheet arrays grown on ACC could significantly promote both mass transport and electric conductivity, and the embedded Ni6Mo6C with moderated hydrogen adsorption ability (Delta GH* = -0.13 eV) and low water dissociation barrier (Delta Gb = 0.27 eV) exhibited remarkable performance and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Optimal Ni6Mo6C/NiMoOx/ACC demonstrates zero onset overpotential and an overpotential of only 29 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability (60 h loss-free continuous operation) in 1.0 M KOH solution, even surpassing the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Especially, the as-made electrocatalyst shows robust flexibility and its high electrocatalytic performance almost keeps constant under distorted states, thus meeting the requirements of flexible electrocatalysts such as bendability. These findings afford a new idea to integrally construct highly efficient flexible electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300065

Effective utilization of biomass requires reductive upgrading of the raw carbon-oxygenates to more valuable compounds. Electroreductive coupling offers a promising strategy for this upgrading by reducing the oxygenated functional groups and increasing molecular weight through C-C bond formation. Despite this promise, elctroreductive coupling suffers from a lack of fundamental understanding. In particular, the cross-coupling of different species remains poorly understood. In this work, the electroreductive coupling of benzaldehyde and furfural on Cu and Pb electrodes is investigated. Reactivity studies show both self-coupling and cross-coupling of the two aldehydes on these two metal surfaces, but with different selectivities. Cu shows greater selectivity for cross-coupling, whereas Pb favors furfural coupling. Comparison with a stochastic model suggests that both metals deviate from stochastic coupling control, with greater deviation on Pb, likely due to a larger difference in aldehyde binding energies. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and in situ spectroscopy further support stronger benzaldehyde adsorption compared to furfural on both metals, with a larger difference in binding energy for Pb. Combined, the reactivity, CV, and spectroscopy experiments suggest that cross-coupling of the two aldehydes follows a two reactant Sabatier rule, with optimum cross-coupling for electrodes and similar reactant binding energies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300066

The octahedral ruthenium complex [Ru(acac)(2)(pyimN)] ((RuN)-N-III 3) is shown to abstract a hydrogen atom from the ruthenium hydride [RuH(CNN)(dppb)] (RuH 2, CNN = 2-aminomethyl-6-tolylpyridine, dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)-butane) to generate [Ru(acac)2(pyimNH)] ((RuNH4)-N-II) and a reduced Ru(CNN)(dppb) complex. As (RuN3)-N-III can be electrochemically regenerated from (RuNH4)-N-II under appropriately basic and oxidizing conditions, we envisioned using (RuN)-N-III 3 as a suitable electrochemically regenerable hydrogen atom acceptor in a tandem electrocatalytic cycle to reduce the overpotential for electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation by 450 mV. In the presence of a strong base, the previously reported alcohol oxidation electrocatalyst [RuX(CNN)(dppb)] (1, X = Cl, 2, X = H) catalyzes the oxidation of isopropanol to acetone with a turnover frequency (TOF) greater than 3 s(-1) at -0.70 V versus ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc(+/0)) in tetrahydrofuran. Upon adding (RuNH)-N-II 4, RuCl 1 electrocatalytically oxidizes isopropanol to acetone at -1.20 V versus Fc(+/0) in tetrahydrofuran with a TOF of ca. 1 s(-1). Cyclic voltammetry and chemical hydrogen atom transfer studies suggest that the predominant electrocatalytic pathway involves hydrogen atom abstraction from RuH 2 by electrochemically generated (RuN)-N-III 3.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300067

In this study, we chose iron and nickel phosphides as model catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to elucidate the alloying effect of FexNi2-xP (x = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5), which has the same P (6) over bar 2m crystal structure with different alloy compositions. The Fe0.5Ni1.5P catalyst recorded the optimal HER performances, including small overpotential (0.163 V at 50 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1)), and high exchange current density (0.37 mA cm(-2)), which were superior to pure Ni2P, Fe2P, and other FexNi2-xP catalysts in acidic media. The charge of phosphorus atoms in Fe0.5Ni1.5P was proven the most deficient one by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data supported that the small distortion degree of the metal-metal (M-M) bonds in the Fe0.5Ni1.5P significantly suppresses the metal to phosphorus (M-to-P) charge transfer and increases the electronic deficiency of phosphorus atoms. We also performed the density functional theory (DFT) calculation to support our charge trend of phosphorus and local distortion of M-to-P bonds. Our finding provided the observation of electron-deficient phosphorus sites modulated by the alloy composition of FexNi2-xP and showed how the degree of the M-M bond distortion correlates with HER properties in acidic media.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300069

In this future energy scenario, the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is a pivotal process for onsite hydrogen production and/or electricity generation. However, its implementation is hindered by the nondurable nature of AOR catalysis by platinum. Accordingly, securement of a durable Pt electrocatalysis for the AOR is critical but has been hampered by the well-known chemical deactivation (i.e., poisoning). Additionally, the structural stability, which could also affect durable AOR operation, has scarcely been investigated. Herein, the degradation of Pt catalysts under AOR conditions has been investigated with various operando and in/ex situ spectroscopies. We demonstrate that NH3 (or AOR intermediates/byproducts) modifies the chemical structures of both the Pt surface and dissolved Pt ions, specifically by passivation of the Pt surface with NH3-derived adsorbates and complexation of the dissolved Pt ions, respectively. These modifications lead to a significant acceleration in Pt dissolution but a deceleration in its redeposition, resulting in the augmented structural degradation of Pt catalysts in NH3-containing electrolyte after the Pt has experienced a potential excursion above ca. 1 VRHE. With these understandings, a quasi-stable operation potential window and operational strategy are suggested. The tentative AOR protocol allows prolonged NH3 electrolysis with alleviated Pt dissolution (<0.02 ng cm(Pt)(-2) s(-1)), suggesting that NH3 will be a viable future energy carrier if the rational operational strategy proposed herein is developed further.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300070

Here, a highly active diruthenium complex based on the bis(bipyridyl)pyrazolate (bbp(-)) ligand scaffold is anchored on electronically conducting multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using a pyrene group attached to either the pyrazolate backbone (2) or to multiple axial ligand positions (1). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) show the presence of >75% sp(2) hybridization of the MWCNTs and an increase of spectral weight of pi-pi* transitions upon immobilization of the pyrene-modified ligand or diruthenium complex, supporting pyrene anchoring via pi-pi interactions. Upon electrochemical oxidation the pyrene groups confined to the MWCNT-modified electrodes are rapidly converted to redox-active surface-bound quinone species. The water oxidation performance of the hybrid systems is studied by cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments under acidic aqueous condition (triflic acid, pH 1). Whereas the complex anchored at the backbone position shows higher initial catalytic activity, the complex anchored via four axial ligand positions features a higher stability. X-ray photoemission (XPS) data before and after electrochemical measurements reveal that the chemical structure of the immobilized complex remains intact under catalytic conditions. The results suggest that anchoring of Ru-2 complexes by differently located pyrene groups on MWCNTs offers good performance for electron transfer, however, a single pyrene group at the pyrazolate backbone does not provide sufficiently strong surface attachment. The distinct experimental results for MWCNT hybrids with anchored 1 and 2 are further discussed in terms of the preferred attachment position at the pyrazolate-based Ru-2 scaffold and the orientation of the catalyst's active site with respect to the supporting surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200033

These catalysts showed remarkable catalytic efficiencies (turnover numbers of 100,000 for ethenolysis and 200,000 for propenolysis) and excellent alpha-olefin selectivity (up to 99%). A computational study indicated that the energy barrier of the beta-hydride elimination pathway in the presence of a phosphine-copper cocatalyst is higher than that in the absence of the cocatalyst, which might contribute to the improved longevity of the ruthenium catalyst in the reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200031

However, the lack of an in-depth understanding of its intrinsic defect properties limits further improvement of its performance. In this study, comprehensive spectroscopic characterizations are combined with theoretical calculations to investigate the defect properties of Ta3N5. The obtained electronic structure of Ta3N5 reveals that oxygen impurities are shallow donors, while nitrogen vacancies and reduced Ta centers (Ta3+) are deep traps. The Ta3+ defects are identified to be most detrimental to the water splitting performance because their energetic position lies below the water reduction potential. Based on these findings, a simple H2O2 pretreatment method is employed to improve the PEC performance of the Ta3N5 photoanode by reducing the concentration of Ta3+ defects, resulting in a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 2.25%. The fundamental knowledge about the defect properties of Ta3N5 could serve as a guideline for developing more efficient photoanodes and photocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200001

Nevertheless, producing liquid hydrocarbons with a single catalyst without utilizing additional C-C coupling agents remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional iron aluminum oxide (FeAlOx) catalyst that directly converts CO2 into C5+ hydrocarbons with an overall selectivity of 77.0% and CO2 conversion of 20.2% at a H-2/CO2 ratio of 1:1. Notably, the selectivity for linear alpha-olefins (LAOs) was 52.4%, accounting for 78.4% of the total C4+ olefins. At a high H-2/CO2 ratio of 3:1, the yield of C5+ hydrocarbons was 19.7%. The concept of crystalline-/amorphous-structured active sites in the single FeAlOx catalyst was proposed. The reducible magnetite (Fe3O4) phase, which contains surface oxygen vacancies, facilitated the reverse-water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction to form CO via CO2 hydrogenation, and subsequent C-C coupling over Hagg iron carbide afforded lower olefins (C2-C4(=)). Long-chain LAOs were then formed on the surface of amorphous aluminum oxide (AlOx) via the readsorption of (C-2-C-4(=)). In addition, the amorphous AlOx phase enhanced CO2 and H-2 adsorption, which facilitated the formation of carbonate, bicarbonate, and formate species via the RWGS reaction and the subsequent formation of long-chain hydrocarbons via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. The bifunctional FeAlOx catalyst showed excellent stability for up to 450 h onstream, demonstrating its potential as a practical-scale catalyst for the conversion of CO2 into value-added liquid fuels and chemicals.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200002

Here, we report variedly sized Pd nanoparticles (NPs) (2.1-10.4 nm) on gamma-alumina by a one-step colloid synthesis method for stoichiometric methane combustion. The results of structural analysis based on transmission electron microscopy and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy show that, with increasing size, Pd NPs evolve their shape from irregular to spherical-like structure along with a progressively decreased fraction of Pd corner sites. Moreover, the intrinsic catalytic activity (turnover frequency) of Pd NPs for methane combustion monotonously decreases by about 6-fold when the size of Pd NPs increases from 2.1 to 10.4 nm, suggestive of a protuberant size-dependent activity of Pd catalyst in this reaction. Further confirmed by the potential energy profiles of the rate-determining step in the reaction from density functional theory calculations, the methane molecule is much easier to be activated on corner sites than on the other sites (i.e., edge and terrace sites) over Pd NPs. This work elucidates the origin of size-dependent activity of Pd catalysts via an investigation on their surface structure and could help to engineer highly efficient catalysts for this reaction.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200003

Detailed characterizations reveal that the support shape effect of Pt/CeO2 catalysts on nitrobenzene hydrogenation originates from the exposed crystal planes on CeO2 with different reducibilities. A high-energy surface is readily reduced to generate more Ce3+ surface sites and oxygen vacancies, not only favoring the dispersion and stabilization of Pt species due to stronger metal-support interaction but also providing more adsorption sites for reactants and intermediates. Reduction treatment at high temperatures has been proved to be an effective way to improve the performance of Pt/CeO2 catalysts by providing additional Ce3+ surface sites and high H-spillover capability. The additional Ce3+ far away from Pt, derived from a high-temperature reduction, can adsorb the N-phenylhydroxylamine intermediate more effectively due to its stronger electron-donating ability and in turn promote aniline formation. It is also found that Na ions with suitable content facilitate the generation and stabilization of surface Ce3+ by charge transfer and help Pt particles to maintain a smaller size. Consequently, a 0.25 wt % Pt catalyst, supported on Na-containing CeO2 nanorods and reduced at 600 degrees C, displays a high level of aniline productivity of 40.8 molAN/gPt/h and excellent stability in nitrobenzene hydrogenation at room temperature. A pathway of nitrobenzene hydrogenation catalyzed by Pt/CeO2 is also proposed.									13	1	0	0	2	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200004

However, the development of efficient light-harvesting and photocatalytic systems remains a significant challenge because of scarcity of low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts in CO2 conversion. Herein, a tunable selectivity in photothermal CO2 conversion was demonstrated over a series of Fe-based catalysts developed through a simple hydrogenation/carbonization treatment with commercial Fe3O4 as a precursor. The Fe3O4 catalyst demonstrated a full selectivity toward CO (about 100%) and 11.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1) activity for the photothermal catalytic conversion of CO2. More importantly, the purephase theta-Fe3C produced remarkably high selectivity toward hydrocarbon products (>97%) and superior activity (10.9 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) in the photothermal conversion of CO2. Meanwhile, it is found that the selectivity toward a hydrocarbon (CHx) can be modulated by the extent of hydrogenation/carbonization of the Fe3O4 precursor. In addition, we demonstrated the vital influence of the nonthermal effect on the enhanced catalytic performance with the Fe-based catalysts during the photothermal conversion of CO2.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200005

Nevertheless, O-demethylation of aryl methyl ethers is a tool to valorize natural and pharmaceutical compounds by deprotecting reactive hydroxyl moieties. Various oxidative enzymes are known to catalyze this reaction at the expense of molecular oxygen, which may lead in the case of phenols/catechols to undesired side reactions (e.g., oxidation, polymerization). Here an oxygen-independent demethylation via methyl transfer is presented employing a cobalamin-dependent veratrol-O-demethylase (vdmB). The biocatalytic demethylation transforms a variety of aryl methyl ethers with two functional methoxy moieties either in 1,2-position or in 1,3-position. Biocatalytic reactions enabled, for instance, the regioselective monodemethylation of substituted 3,4-dimethoxy phenol as well as the monodemethylation of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene. The methyltransferase vdmB was also successfully applied for the regioselective demethylation of natural compounds such as papaverine and rac-yatein. The approach presented here represents an alternative to chemical and enzymatic demethylation concepts and allows performing regioselective demethylation in the absence of oxygen under mild conditions, representing a valuable extension of the synthetic repertoire to modify pharmaceuticals and diversify natural products.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200006	32974079

Herein, a compartmentalization method involving the integration of a cocatalyst system has been developed, which enables an efficient Michael addition/reduction enantioselective dual-catalysis process to be accomplished from a noncompatible system. In this process, the chiral squaramide species is encapsulated within the cavity of one hollow-shellmesostructured silica support, whereas the chiral organoruthenium/diamine species is entrapped within the cavity of another watersoluble thermoresponsive polymer-coating hollow-shell-mesostructured silica support. This shielding feature together with the reversible on-off mode of the water-soluble thermoresponsive polymer not only controls the cross-interactions of dual species but also harmonizes the reaction conditions. As we envisioned, the one-pot sequential Michael addition of alpha-nitrosulfone and enones followed by asymmetric transfer hydrogenation provides various 1,4-distereocentered chiral delta-hydroxysulfones with enhanced yields and enantio/diastereoselectivities.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200007

Two clear structural changes were observed as the temperature was increased from 25 to 500 degrees C in the presence of H-2(g): the first involved nucleation of nanoscale Ni-rich particles and the second involved general collapse of the remaining oxide phase along with substantial coarsening of the alloy particles. The activity of the catalyst toward alkaline hydrogen evolution was found to reach a maximum in a narrow range of reduction temperatures from 375 to 425 degrees C. This resulted in the formation of a mixed-phase product comprising sub-10 nm Ni0.9Mo0.1 particles embedded in a porous Mo-rich oxide matrix. Thus, the most active Ni-Mo catalyst apparently requires intimate contact between the alloy component and the oxide phase, lending support to a catalytic mechanism involving metallic and oxidized surface sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200008

Electrocatalyst supports based on tantalum-doped tin oxide (Ta/SnO2) were prepared by electrospinning. The dopant amount was varied between 0 (undoped SnO2) and 7.5 at. %, and the resulting materials were characterized for their morphology, composition, structure, porosity, and electrical properties. Platinum nanoparticles prepared by a microwave-assisted polyol method were deposited with different loadings on 1 at. % Ta-doped SnO2 (1Ta/SnO2), selected for its highest electrical conductivity of 0.09 S cm(-1). Their electrocatalytic properties toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were compared with those of the same particles deposited on carbon black and those of a commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst. Pt/1Ta/SnO2 showed higher ORR activity and stability at high potential than Pt/C. In particular, the electrocatalyst with the lowest Pt loading (7 wt %) presented high mass activity and stability which, from XPS analysis, is suggested to result from very strong metal-support interaction. These results indicate that amongst tin oxides doped with pentavalent metals such as niobium (Nb/SnO2), antimony (Sb/SnO2), and tantalum, Ta/SnO2 has the advantage of both higher conductivity than Nb/SnO2 and greater stability in the fuel cell voltage range than Sb/SnO2.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200009

Here, we present the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into C-2 products such as ethylene and ethanol with high selectivity using a self-assembled cuprous coordination polymer nanoparticle (Cu-SCP). The features of the Cu-SCP catalyst are the arrangement of Cu atoms in close proximity, similar to that in metallic Cu, and a stable Cu(I) oxidation state throughout the reaction due to the coordination of ligands with Cu atoms, which inhibits conversion into Cu metal particles. The Cu-SCP also exhibits activity for C-2 production that is superior to that of a Cu metal electrode, without modification of the carbon particles and/or ionomers or continuous flow of the highly alkaline electrolyte, which will simplify the fabrication of a CO2 electrolyzer. The Cu-SCP can be synthesized by a facile process that utilizes a heterogeneous reaction, and the product selectivity can be changed by replacement of the organic ligands, which should open up possibilities for the design of other CO2 reduction catalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200010

However, the kinetic features required for efficient turnover of a process where "multiple transformations are effected by a single catalytic mechanism" have not been explored in any detail. The kinetics of a nominally simple two-stage domino catalytic reaction have been analyzed by way of a gold-catalyzed coupling of two electron-deficient arylsilanes to generate an arylated fluorene. A combination of in situ interleaved H-1 and F-19 NMR spectroscopic kinetic measurements, kinetic simulations, and variations in substitution reveal how the catalyst partitioning between the two different cycles impacts both the rate and the selectivity of the process. The insight enables identification that sequential catalyst speciation and accumulation of the domino intermediate are general kinetic criteria for efficient domino catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200011

We present a rational tuning of the hole-accumulation and hole-transfer ability of a catalyst by in situ deposition of IrOx on NiOx islands on model Si electrodes and we demonstrate a distinct hole accumulation behavior during the OER through electrochemical methods, in situ UV-vis and Raman spectroelectrochemistry. We find that the NiOx islands with <10% coverage on an n++-Si dark electrode demonstrate a 6-fold higher capacity of hole accumulation relative to that on an n-Si photoanode under illumination. A further in situ targeted deposition of soluble hexahydroxyiridate on the NiOx leads to the formation of NiOx/IrOx junctions, where the IrOx further depletes the extracted holes by NiOx from the n-Si photoanode decreasing the overpotential by similar to 260 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), yet the IrOx promotes the hole accumulation at the NiOx/IrOx on the dark electrodes presenting a similar decrease of the overpotential. In contrast to the dark-holes, an extremely lower charging level of photogenerated holes of the same catalyst at the identical current density reasoned a seemingly higher reactivity to drive the OER, and reasonably demonstrated a stronger oxidation/ corrosion to the Si electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200012

The functional dependence of the rate of each of these reactions was determined by observing the transient rate after a step-change in reactant partial pressures, specifically whether the rate was discontinuous through a step-change in partial pressure. Steady-state isotopic switching experiments revealed that a persistent surface intermediate with two aromatic rings, likely DPM+, is formed and has a fractional coverage ranging from sparse (near-zero) to complete (nearone) that varies with process conditions. Reaction orders obtained from steady-state rate measurements suggest that HCHO, C6H6, and H2O competitively adsorb on acid sites and that DPM+ deprotonation is first-order in C6H6, implying that deprotonation is assisted by the presence of aromatics. Herein, we propose a complete mechanism for the condensation between HCHO and C6H6 to form DPM, and from this mechanism, a six-parameter (three kinetic/thermodynamic parameters, three apparent activation/thermodynamic energies) kinetic model is derived that quantitatively describes the transient and steady-state rates and steady-state fractional coverages of DPM+.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200013

The well-dispersed Ni particles intimately contacted with MoO2 are anchored on S-11 based on a vacuum-assisted route. There is the obvious presence of electron transfer from Mo species to Ni due to the intimate contact, which can increase the electron density around Ni and consequently promote H activation and desorption on Ni catalyst. Also, the good dispersion of Ni-Mo species on S-11 is favorable to expose more Bronsted acid sites of S-11, being responsible for the skeletal isomerization. These characteristics endow enhanced activity of 3.0Ni-0.5Mo/S-11 for the hydroisomerization of n-hexadecane with a high isomer yield of 81.4%, being comparable to 81.0% for 0.5 wt % Pt/S-11. The analysis of products showed similar isomerization and cracking mechanisms over 3.0Ni-0.5Mo/S-11 catalyst to Pt catalyst. Further, the presence of Mo species can enhance the stability, with no obvious change after 100 h continuous catalytic reaction. Both the catalytic activity and stability are much superior to those of monometallic Ni/S-11 and the reported non-noble-metal catalyst. This work focuses on developing high-effective non-noble-metal-based catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200014

A molecular-level understanding of intermediate structures created during catalysis is essential for developing high-performance bimetal catalysts. We show that intermediate Pt-NiO1-x interfacial structures drive the catalytic synergistic effect observed on Pt3Ni nanocrystals. Real-time microscopic observations at ambient pressure show the formation of oxygen-driven Ni oxide clusters on the surface and provide direct evidence of Pt-NiO1-x interfacial structure formation. Spectroscopic analysis, including ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy, and catalytic measurements elucidate the role of Pt-NiO1-x interfacial structures and the catalytic reaction mechanism in CO oxidation. Our results indicate that metal-oxide interfacial intermediate structures in bimetal catalysts relate to the catalytic enhancement of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200015

Herein, a simple and ingenious strategy is developed for the fabrication of SACs via atomic filtration during a solid diffusion process under the assistance of graphene oxide membranes (GOMs). First, driven by the heat treatment, the Fe species (atoms, cluster, or particles) are emitted from Fe foam diffused through the GOMs. By elaborately modulating the layer numbers of the GOM and their interlayer spacing, the GOM could exclude the cluster and particles of the Fe species. Thus, the permeable single Fe atoms were trapped by defective N-rich sites, producing isolated Fe site catalyst (Fe SAs/N-C). The fabricated SACs exhibited an excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Furthermore, this strategy can be easily expanded to prepare other SACs, such as Co SAs/N-C and Ni SAs/N-C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200016

The PEC potential of the electrocatalyst depends on the chemical oxidation state of forming elements, which may strongly vary under the photoinduced charge flow. However, element-sensitive, real-time measurements of the oxidation state of the electrocatalyst are not generally possible using conventional X-ray absorption techniques. Here, we show that fixed-energy X-ray absorption voltammetry and chronoamperometry, which measure the X-ray absorption coefficient variations along with photocurrent, can follow in real time the redox kinetics of electrocatalysts. To demonstrate the validity, we investigate hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoanodes covered with a nickel hydroxide electrocatalyst and show that it is fully oxidized by photogenerated holes to nickel oxyhydroxide with Ni reaching a higher oxidation state (Ni-IV) than that observed under electrocatalytic oxygen evolution in dark conditions. Highly oxidized Ni results from charge accumulation in the overlayer and can be observed only in the case of thick layers (with low PEC performance). On the other hand, the average oxidation state of Ni reaches lower values, under operative conditions, for very thin layers, resulting in high PEC activity. We complete our study by presenting PEC activity and impedance spectroscopy analysis using different thicknesses of the electrocatalyst, thus giving a detailed picture of the multiple and complex charge transfer processes occurring at a semiconductor/electrocatalyst junction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200017

Their low overpotentials and improved selectivity toward C-2 products make them unique. However, the structure of the active sites responsible for these improvements remains unclear. Herein, by means of a computational model including thermodynamic, kinetic, solvent, and cation effects, we outline the atomic structure of the active sites responsible for ethanol evolution in OD-Cu catalysts. We also point out the specific features that determine selectivity and pinpoint the design criteria that should be fulfilled to enhance the selectivity of the catalysts toward ethanol. Specifically, we propose that square, four-atom Cu islands are the active sites of OD-Cu for CO electroreduction to ethanol as they display favorable *CO dimerization energetics and ethanol selectivity by virtue of their square, undercoordinated structure.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200018

Coupling sterically hindered reaction partners, however, remains challenging. Herein, we disclose the discovery and development of a pyrrole-ol ligand to facilitate the coupling of ortho-substituted aryl iodides with sterically hindered amines. The ligand was discovered through a library screening approach and highlights the value of mining heteroatom-rich pharmaceutical libraries for useful ligand motifs. Further evaluation revealed that this ligand is uniquely effective in these challenging transformations. The reaction enables the coupling of sterically hindered primary and secondary amines, anilines, and amides with broad functional group tolerance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200019

The enzyme's potential is however limited, due to its poor regio and stereoselectivity with enantioselectivities (E-values) below 20 for bulky (aromatic) substrates. By applying computer-guided rational design, a library of single variants was designed that allowed conversion of a set of previously challenging substrates with good activity and E-values up to >200. The computational predictions were found to be in agreement with experimental data, which in turn allowed for the generation of even more active and selective double variants. Overall, the produced set of variants provides a toolbox for the enantioselective acylation of challenging alcohols in water, effectively contributing to an alternative to reactions in organic solvents.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200020

Whereas various Pd-catalyzed migratory cross-couplings have been developed in the past years, the design of an efficient migratory version of the popular Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling has remained elusive. The current article reports a one-pot procedure consisting of alkene hydroboration and migratory Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of the resulting alkylboronic acid intermediate. A high regioselectivity for the benzylic position of the initial alkene was achieved by using P(t-Bu)(2)Me as the ligand and an ortho-substituted aryl electrophile. Regioconvergence from alkene positional and geometrical isomers and long-range migration were demonstrated. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the migration occurs through a partially reversible, nondissociative mechanism.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200021

This method proceeds through a formal anti-carbopalladation, forming trans-alkenyl palladium species, which was trapped by aryl boronic acids to provide all-carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes in 32-92% yields. The trans-selective arylsilylation/remote C-H silylation and hydroarylation/remote C-H borylation of internal alkynes were also achieved using hexamethyldisilane and bis(pinacolato)diboron as trapping reagents, respectively. The reaction features good regio- and stereoselectivity and high functional group tolerance. A preliminary mechanistic study and DFT calculations show that a cis to trans isomerization of cis-alkenyl palladium species was involved in this transformation.									7	0	1	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200022

A major challenge is their insufficient performance and durability in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) under practical hydrogen-air conditions. Herein, we report an effective strategy to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn-N-C catalysts from an environmentally benign aqueous solution, instead of traditional organic solvents. This innovative synthesis method yields an extremely high surface area for accommodating an increased density of MnN4 active sites, which was verified by using advanced electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Mn-N-C catalyst exhibits promising ORR activity along with significantly enhanced stability, achieving a peak power density of 0.39 W cm(-2) under 1.0 bar H-2-air condition in a MEA, outperforming most PGM-free ORR catalysts. The improved performance is likely due to the unique catalyst features, including the curved surface morphology and dominant graphitic carbon structure, thus benefiting mass transport and improving stability. The first-principles calculations further elucidate the enhanced stability, suggesting that MnN4 sites have a higher resistance to demetallation than the traditional FeN4 sites during the ORR.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200023

Crystalline orthorhombic Mo3VOx (Orth-MoVO), trigonal Mo3VOx (Tri-MoVO), and amorphous Mo3VOx (Amor-MoVO) having pentagonal, hexagonal, and heptagonal channels in the crystal structure showed far better catalytic activity and selectivity to methacrylic acid (MAA) than those of various Mo-V-based mixed oxide catalysts. Tetragonal Mo3VOx (Tet-MoVO) having pentagonal and hexagonal but no heptagonal channels in the crystal structure provided minor MCR oxidation activity, and the MAA selectivity was lower than that of the other crystalline Mo3VOx catalysts with heptagonal channels. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements revealed that Orth-MoVO and Tri-MoVO were active with respect to MCR, forming methacrylate as a reaction intermediate, while no infrared (IR) bands related to surface compounds were observed over Tet-MoVO after the MCR injection. Based on these results, we concluded that the crystal structure of crystalline Mo3VOx catalysts significantly affects the catalytic MCR oxidation activity. Orth-MoVO catalyzed the MCR oxidation at low reaction temperatures (<240 degrees C), where the conventional catalyst used for the industrial MCR oxidation process, a heteropoly acid (HPA)-based catalyst, displayed poor catalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200024

We provide a persuasive strategy to turn manganese oxide from a combustion catalyst into a selective catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This success is achieved by anchoring amorphous manganese oxide with thin-layer morphology on a ceria support via constructing strong oxide-support interactions (SOSIs). Multiple structure and mechanism investigations demonstrate that the SOSI forms active interfacial oxygen sites for propane activation and oxygen-deficient manganese oxide to stabilize propene and hinder overoxidation under the ODHP conditions. These features boost the ODHP to exhibit simultaneously high activity and propene selectivity, outperforming the general manganese oxide catalysts and even the practically promising vanadium catalysts.

However, it generally suffers from laborious multistep procedures to obtain a controllable film. Herein, we use an electron density modulation to synthesize a stable NiFeY layered double hydroxide (LDH) OEC and then deposit this OEC on BiVO4 as photoanodes. The incorporation of Y modifies the chemical environment of Ni and reduces the bandgap of NiFe LDH, enhancing the electrocatalytic/photoelectrochemical performance. Importantly, Y insertion in NiFe LDH remarkably reduces the surface recombination of the BiVO4/cocatalyst system, thereby establishing a much high stability to the photocatalyst than in conventional NiFe OEC/BiVO4 approaches.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200028

Inspired by the Fe-Mo-S cofactor in the enzyme nitrogenase, metal sulfide catalysts, mostly Fe- or Mo-based sulfides, have recently received great interest. Here, we propose Cu2-xS (0 <= x < 1) as an efficient NRR electrocatalyst. Electrochemical tests at room temperature and atmospheric pressure reveal that Cu1.81S achieves a high NH3 yield of 2.19 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) along with a Faradaic efficiency of 14.1% at -0.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in an aqueous electrolyte. According to our first-principles calculations, the superior NRR properties originate from the threefold-coordinate Cu sites in Cu1.81S. These sites enable N-H center dot center dot center dot S hydrogen bonding during N2Hy adsorption and stabilize the intermediates on the Cu2-xS surfaces, leading to a significant decrease in the overpotential limit for the NRR. Moreover, the threefold sites not only provide a bioinspired NRR pathway similar to that of nitrogenase but also enable both distal and alternating pathways, increasing the efficiency for the NRR. This study presents an attractive electrocatalyst for the NRR and opens an alternative route to explore chalcogenides and halides as NRR catalysts where the hydrogen-bonding mediation can similarly operate.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200029

Of particular interest is the production of middle distillate fuels (i.e., jet and diesel blendstock) from renewable ethanol feedstock. State-of-the-art alcohol-to-jet technology requires multiple process steps based on the catalytic dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, followed by a multistep oligomerization including n-butene formation and then hydrotreatment and distillation. Here we report that, over Ag-ZrO2/SBA-16 with balanced metal and Lewis acid sites, ethanol is directly converted to n-butene (1- and 2-butene mixtures) with an exceptional butene-rich olefin selectivity of 88% at 99% conversion. The need for the ethanol dehydration to ethylene step is eliminated. Thus, it offers the potential for a reduction in the number of required processing units versus conventional alcohol-to-jet technology. We also found that the C-4 product distribution, n-butene and/or 1,3-butadiene, can be tailored on this catalyst by tuning the hydrogen feed partial pressure and other process/catalyst parameters. With sufficient hydrogen partial pressure, 1,3-butadiene is completely and selectively hydrogenated to form n-butene. The reaction mechanism was elucidated through operando-nuclear magnetic resonance investigations coupled with reactivity measurements. Ethanol is first dehydrogenated to acetaldehyde over the metallic Ag, then acetaldehyde is converted to crotonaldehyde over the acid sites of ZrO2/SiO2 via aldol condensation followed by dehydration. This is followed by a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of crotonaldehyde to butadiene intermediate that is hydrogenated into n-butene over metallic Ag and ZrO2. A minor fraction of n-butene is also produced from crotonaldehyde reduction to butyraldehyde instead of butadiene. Isotopically labeled ethanol NMR experiments demonstrated that ethanol, rather than H-2, is the source of H for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to butyraldehyde. Combined experimental-computational investigation reveals how changes in silver and zirconium composition and the silver oxidation state affects reactivity under controlled hydrogen partial pressures and after prolonged run times. Finally, catalyst effectiveness also was demonstrated when using wet ethanol feed, thus highlighting process flexibility in terms of feedstock purity requirements.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200032

Amidomethylative reactions that reserve C=C double bonds have been composed sequentially for tandem catalytic substitutions around the C=C bonds of alkenes. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, tandem catalytic amidomethylative processes, which effectively form multiple C-C bonds, have been developed to directly and selectively transform a-substituted styrenes into unsaturated N-heterocycles. Using Fe(OTf)(3) as the sole catalyst, the operationally simple protocols employ bench-stable bisamidomethane as the sole reagent to produce hexahydropyrimidines and 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine derivatives. Moreover, the practical catalytic processes constituted facile two-step pathways, from simple alpha-substituted styrenes, to access unsaturated 1,3-diamine and bispidine derivatives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200034

However, the insufficient durability issue of PtM is often raised because of the fast dissolution of M in acid, impeding their commercialization. Herein, we report on a Ketjenblack (KB)-supported, nitrogen (N)-doped intermetallic PtNiN (Int-PtNiN/KB) catalyst that exhibits remarkably enhanced ORR activity and stability in an acidic electrolyte, superior to those of disordered PtNi/KB, disordered PtNiN/KB, and commercial Pt/C. The experimental results show that Int-PtNiN/KB has a distinctive ordering structure of alternating Ni-4-N and Pt planes; we attribute the origin of the superior stability of this catalyst to the combined effect of the Ni-4-N formation and the unique intermetallic structure, which effectively precludes Ni dissolution from the core. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the tensile strain introduced by the formation of an intermetallic phase and N-doping optimizes the binding of oxygenated species on the Pt surface and enable highly efficient electron transfer, leading to the enhanced ORR performance. This study offers an appropriate route for further enhancing both the activity and durability of PtM catalysts through a facile synthesis method by annealing in an NH3 gas under appropriate conditions.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200035

Herein, direct cellulose hydrogenolysis to C-3-C-4 keto-alcohol products (hydroxyacetone and 1(3)hydroxy-2-butanone) was achieved over Ni-WOx/C catalysts with an W/Ni atom ratio of 1.0-5.0. The keto-alcohol yield was proposed to strongly depend on the W/Ni ratio and the catalyst annealing temperature. The highest keto-alcohol yield of 63% was obtained at the optimal balance of basic/acidic WOx species and metallic Ni. The introduction of Ni facilitated the formation of the basic W5+ sites, which enhanced the formation of basic sites at the Ni-WOx interface. The synergistic effect between the basic W5+ and acidic oxygen vacancy (Vo) could activate the target C-O/C=O bonds, promoting the isomerization of glucose and C-3-C-4 aldehyde intermediates with the assistance of the interfacial Ni. The cooperative adsorption of the -OH and -C=O groups at the Ni-O-W-Vo interface stabilized the adjacent ketone and hydroxyl groups and kept the other hydroxyl groups for hydrogenolysis, obtaining the final C-3-C-4 keto-alcohols. This work expanded the application of cellulosic biomass, enabling the green and sustainable synthesis of the high-value C-3-C-4 keto-alcohol products using lignocellulosic biomass as a raw material.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200036

In this work, the surface hydroxyl groups and surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs) on alumina were modified by a convenient and environmentally friendly plasma treatment method. Different Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via impregnation of the treated alumina, and the effects of different surface hydroxyl groups and SOVs on their reactivity for the reversible hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of DBT were investigated. The results show that SOVs increased after H-2 plasma treatment, whereas the surface hydroxyl groups increased and SOVs decreased after O-2 plasma treatment. Both the surface hydroxyl group and SOV can improve Pt metal dispersion. The more interesting observation is that the hydroxyl groups promote hydrogen spillover and the proportion of Pt(0), which not only benefit the catalyst hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activity but also reduce side reactions and increase long-term cycle performance. However, increased SOVs increased the fraction of low coordinated Pt which reduces the long-term cycle performance of the catalyst. As a result, increasing surface hydroxyl groups and appropriately reducing SOVs on Pt/Al2O3 are propitious for improving both reactivity and long-term cycle performance when using DBT as a LOHC.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200037

Recent Developments in Enantioselective Transition Metal Catalysis Featuring Attractive Noncovalent Interactions between Ligand and Substrate								ACS CATALYSIS				10	18			10672	10714		10.1021/acscatal.0c02957				SEP 18 2020	2020	Enantioselective transition metal catalysis is an area very much at the forefront of contemporary synthetic research. The development of processes that enable the efficient synthesis of enantiopure compounds is of unquestionable importance to chemists working within the many diverse fields of the central science. Traditional approaches to solving this challenge have typically relied on leveraging repulsive steric interactions between chiral ligands and substrates in order to raise the energy of one of the diastereomeric transition states over the other. By contrast, this Review examines an alternative tactic in which a set of attractive noncovalent interactions operating between transition metal ligands and substrates are used to control enantioselectivity. Examples where this creative approach has been successfully applied to render fundamental synthetic processes enantioselective are presented and discussed. In many of the cases examined, the ligand scaffold has been carefully designed to accommodate these attractive interactions, while in others, the importance of the critical interactions was only elucidated in subsequent computational and mechanistic studies. Through an exploration and discussion of recent reports encompassing a wide range of reaction classes, we hope to inspire synthetic chemists to continue to develop asymmetric transformations based on this powerful concept.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200038	32983588

The active species is [Ni(kappa(2)-dppf)(kappa(1)-dppf)], which undergoes a halide abstraction reaction with alkyl halides and rapidly captures the alkyl radical that is formed. The rates of the reactions of [Ni(COD)(dppf)] with alkyl halides and the yields of prototypical nickel-catalyzed Kumada cross-coupling reactions of alkyl halides are shown to be significantly improved by the addition of free dppf ligand.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200040	32983589

The deposit is porous, with a honeycomb-like primary structure and a dendritic-like secondary structure. The onset potential for the electroreduction of CO2 is 80 mV lower on dendritic Sn1Pb3 as compared to dendritic Pb. The faradaic efficiency for formate formation is close to 100% in the potential range from -1.16 to -1.56 V vs. SHE. Density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to uncover the origin of the decrease in the onset potential upon alloying Pb with Sn. Explicit treatment of water molecules in DFT calculations turns out as crucial to achieve an agreement with experimentally measured onset potentials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200041

We found that the use of promoters alters the balance between iron oxides and iron carbides in the catalyst, which affects the CO and CO2 conversion. The Na- and K-promoted catalysts facilitated the production of C-2-C-32 olefins, and a parametric study with 12 feedstock compositions (CO/CO2 = 0.2-5 and H-2/(CO + CO2) = 1-3) revealed that the Na/Fe-Zn catalyst exhibited a 6.1-times higher apparent CO consumption rate and 2.7-times higher apparent CO2 consumption rate than the K/Fe-Zn catalyst at 340 degrees C and 2.0 MPa. At a CO/CO2 ratio of 0.2 and H-2/(CO + CO2) ratio of 2, the Na/Fe-Zn catalyst achieved the maximum linear alpha-olefin yield (17.9%) at 70.3% apparent CO conversion and 26.0% apparent CO2 conversion (58.4% higher than those of the K/Fe-Zn catalyst) over 200 h. The Na/Fe-Zn catalyst activity for apparent CO conversion was more than twice that of the K/Fe-Zn catalyst, and it also exhibited better reactivity in terms of chain growth probability and secondary reactions, such as isomerization and hydrogenation. Characterization experiments revealed that the spent Na/Fe-Zn catalyst contained 43.2% iron carbides (mainly Fe5C2), and these were distributed within 19 nm of the catalyst particle surface. In contrast, the spent K/Fe-Zn catalyst was mostly composed of core-shell-type iron carbides (74.3% Fe5C2 and 21.2% Fe7C3) surrounded by carbonate/carbonyl carbon species. H2O isotherms of the spent catalysts were studied to understand factors affecting CO adsorption and CO2 reactivity, and theoretical calculations were used to probe CO hydrogenation productivity. The reactivity of Na/Fe-Zn toward CO and CO2 was analyzed with respect to the temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocities, and optimal olefin productivity.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200043

Their beneficial effects can manifest in different ways, such as increasing rates of polymerization, altering polymer microstructures, enhancing catalyst thermal stability, or a combination of these effects. We have systematically quantified secondary metal ion influences on nickel phenoxyphosphine polyethylene glycol (PEG) complexes. We demonstrate that cation tuning could readily achieve three-dimensional structures and electronic environments that are not easily accessible through conventional ligand tuning. This study led to the development of extremely active ethylene polymerization catalysts. For example, the nickel-lithium complex gave activity and turnover number as high as 7.0 x 10(4) kg PE/mol Ni.h and 2.5 x 10(6) mol ethylene/mol Ni, respectively, and the nickel-cesium complex showed unusual thermal stability up to 90 degrees C (activity = 2.3 x 10(4) kg/mol h, turnover number = similar to 4.1 x 10(5) mol ethylene/mol Ni, and M-n = 1.6 x 10(4) g/mol). We provide both experimental and computational data showing that secondary metals impact the relative stability of cis and trans isomers, which is a phenomenon not shown previously. Unlike in our earlier work, which was limited by poor nuclearity control and/or secondary metals that were too far from the catalyst center, the nickel phenoxyphosphine-PEG complex is an ideal platform for future studies of cation-controlled polymerization.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200044

Due to growing concerns regarding the validity of Pt counter electrodes in such measurements, largely attributed to their dissolution and redeposition, graphite is increasingly being employed as a versatile counter electrode in conventional three-electrode systems. However, the reliability of graphite in this role has not been fully investigated. Herein, we have demonstrated that using graphite as a counter electrode can significantly hinder the precise evaluations of electrocatalytic materials. For a polycrystalline Pt surface coupled with a graphite counter electrode, the rapid loss of catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) is observed within a few voltammetric evaluation cycles. Online differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) revealed that the catalytic activity loss is mainly due to the formation of poisonous carbon monoxide (CO) and its subsequent strong adsorption on the catalytic Pt sites. CO coverage on the Pt surface becomes almost saturated within just 50 cycles of HER polarization measurements. The resultant underestimation of activity is effectively avoidable by physically separating the graphite counter electrode from the analyte in an H-type cell. Consequently, our findings highlight that, similar to Pt counter electrodes, graphite counter electrodes must be carefully applied to eliminate any experimental artifacts originating from CO evolved during electrocatalytic reactions.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200045

The reaction proceeds via an aminocatalytic double Michael addition in high formal peri-, diastereo-, and enatioselectivity (up to 99% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations conclude that the reaction takes advantage of the in situ generation of a highly reactive amino isobenzofulvene intermediate via an aromative aminocatalytic strategy. A significant nonlinear effect is observed, consistent with a dual-activation model. Kinetic studies suggest a stepwise mechanism which is further supported by the identification and isolation of diastereomeric precyclization intermediates. These intermediates showed that in the presence of the aminocatalyst, they re-enter the catalytic cycle and afford the [10 + 2] cycloadduct with the same stereoselectivity observed in the prototypical reaction. Density functional theory calculations identified a Curtin-Hammett scenario where the stereoisomer of the [10 + 2] cycloadduct is determined by downstream species. These mechanistic investigations provide an understanding of the reaction pathway and stereoselectivity and continue to increase the knowledge of higher-order cycloadditions.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200046

A general protocol for the hydroarylation of electronically diverse alkenes with anilines would be ideal to provide densely functionalized compounds. However, this transformation has been underexplored compared to more traditional hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes because of the significant challenges associated with the control of the selectivity and its substrate tolerance. Herein, we describe a selective, versatile, and user-friendly ortho-C-alkylation of anilines with alkenes that hinges on the beneficial combination of a Lewis acid (Ca(II)) and hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent. This protocol allows for the extension of this transformation to highly deactivated styrenes and demonstrates a remarkable improved reactivity regarding aliphatic alkenes, styrene derivatives, and dienes. In addition, DFT computations were performed which, combined with experimental observations, suggest a nearly concerted mechanism that impart the ortho-selectivity.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200047

ProRSs are modular enzymes and the "prokaryotic-like" ProRSs are distinguished from "eukaryotic-like" ProRSs by the presence of an editing insertion domain (INS) inserted between motifs 2 and 3 of the main catalytic domain. Earlier studies suggested that the presence of coupled-domain dynamics could contribute to catalysis; however, the role that the distal and highly mobile INS domain plays in catalysis at the synthetic active site is not completely understood. In the present study, a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches has been used to elucidate the precise role of INS domain dynamics. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations were carried out to model catalytic prolyl-adenylate formation by Enterococcus faecalis ProRS. The energetics of the adenylate formation by the wild-type enzyme was computed and contrasted with variants containing active site mutations as well as a deletion mutant lacking the INS domain. The combined results revealed that two distinct types of dynamics contribute to the enzyme's catalytic power. One set of motions is intrinsic to the INS domain and leads to conformational preorganization that is essential for catalysis. A second type of motion, stemming from the electrostatic reorganization of active site residues, impacts the height and width of the energy profile and has a critical role in fine-tuning the substrate orientation to facilitate reactive collisions. Thus, motions in a distal domain can preorganize the active site of an enzyme to optimize catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700050	34295570

ACS uses a complex Ni-Fe-S metallocluster termed the A-cluster to assemble acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide, a methyl moiety and coenzyme A. Here, we report the crystal structure of CODH/ACS from Moorella thermoacetica with substrate carbon monoxide bound at the A-cluster, a state previously uncharacterized by crystallography. Direct structural characterization of this state highlights the role of second sphere residues and conformational dynamics in acetyl-CoA assembly, the biological equivalent of the Monsanto process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700009	33495716

We describe visible light-promoted [2 + 2] cycloaddition with concomitant dearomatization of indole derivatives tethered with olefins at the N1 position via the energy transfer process, providing cyclobutane-fused polycyclic indoline derivatives that are potentially useful in drug design and discovery. These cyclobutane-fused indoline-based polycycles are obtained in high yields and with good diastereoselectivities (>99:1). The key to the success of the reaction is the formation of H-bond(s) between N-alkenoylindole and solvent, enabling the reduction of the triplet energy of the indole derivatives, which greatly improved the efficiency of the protocol. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by late-stage skeletal diversification of indole-containing bioactive molecules, which provides a powerful strategy for the rapid skeleton remodeling. DFT calculations were used to give a deep understanding of the reaction pathways.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700043

To achieve a high photosynthesis efficiency, green plants compartmentalize water oxidation and NADPH regeneration modules on two sides of the thylakoid membrane while conveying electron transfer and proton transport via the channeling of the electron transfer chain and ATP synthase, respectively. Herein, we demonstrate this principle in vitro by using UiO-66 to confine platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) inside and immobilize L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) outside for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of a-keto acid. The framework structure of UiO-66 affords the compartmentalization of LAAO and Pt NPs to avoid the deactivation of LAAO by Pt NPs, while its angstrom-scale pore size ensures channeling of the byproduct, H2O2, from LAAO to Pt NPs for instant elimination. A 99.7% yield of alpha-keto acid is achieved, far surpassing that enabled by free LAAO (41.2%). The compartmentalization-channeling strategy offers a generic platform to coordinate reactions and mass transfer in complex catalytic processes beyond chemoenzymatic catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700001

We recently introduced a Cr N-phosphinoamidine catalyst ((P,N)Cr) transition-state model for selectivity, and here, we use density functional theory calculations to address catalyst reactivity for ethylene trimerization. This is particularly important because there are currently no empirical parameters or design principles that provide prediction of high catalyst activity while maintaining trimerization selectivity. Specifically, using transition states and the energetic span model, we examined the ethylene trimerization catalytic cycle with the bidentate (P,N)Cr catalyst 1a and compared this highly productive catalyst to the surprisingly inactive tridentate (P,N,N)Cr catalyst. For (P,N)Cr 1a, this analysis revealed that for the high-spin Cr-I/III chromacycle mechanism, there are multiple Cr-I ethylene-coordinated resting states and multiple turnover-controlling transition states, which is consistent with previous experimental rate studies and can account for a partial rate order in ethylene. Based on the calculated energy landscape, the calculated 1-hexene productivity of 6.5 mol s(-1) and mass of 2.0 x 10(6) g h(-1) is close to the experimental value. This analysis also revealed that the tridentate (P,N,N)Cr catalyst has a much larger energy span and is similar to 10(7) slower, which results from the stabilization of the energy landscape around the chromacyclopentane intermediate. In addition to this reactivity/inactivity comparison, we also calculated and compared the reactivity of several other experimentally reported 1-hexene Cr tridentate catalysts. Based on the catalytic energy spans, our calculations were able to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively replicate relative catalyst reactivity.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700002

With the use of an ultrathin and flat 12 mu m thick porous electrode complimented by an efficient gas-circulating loop, the GAME facilitates rapid mass transport of reactants and products at the three-phase interface, enabling electrocatalytic processes to be investigated with fine kinetic details at high current densities (A cm(-2)) using only mu g cm(-2) of catalyst. The mass transport rate constant of the GAME is generally 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those achieved using conventional techniques. The gas handling protocol ensures better utilization and fast switching of different gaseous environments within a few seconds, thereby reducing the use of gases and allowing for measurement of transient responses. This electrochemical configuration can be further coupled with a range of other analytical approaches, such as micro-/nanoelectrodes, mass spectrometry, photocatalysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for real-time/in situ electrochemical measurements, where reaction intermediates and products can be readily characterized. These innovative types of hyphenated platforms can be applied to study complex gas-to-fuel conversion processes (e.g., carbon dioxide electroreduction), in which multiple species need to be simultaneously identified and quantified to illustrate the dynamic product distribution. Moreover, the configuration can be possibly adapted for operando synchrotron-based X-ray characterization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700003

It, however, fails in selective acetylene hydrogenation: at high H-2 pressures and 100% conversion, the dominant product is ethane, not the desirable ethene. Despite decades' efforts, even the structure of the catalyst remains to be veiled by the in situ formation of unknown PdHx and, controversially, PdCx phases. Here, by combining our recently developed machine learning potential global optimization, microkinetic simulation, and catalysis experiment, we resolve a Pd4H3 phase formed under hydrogenation reaction conditions (e.g., 298 K and p(H-2) > 0.1 atm), in which the exposed Pd4H3(100) open surface is the most responsible for catalyzing the deep hydrogenation to ethane at high H-2 pressures. This finding is rooted in the thermodynamics phase diagram for the Pd-H bulk and surfaces from millions of structure candidates explored by stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization and the lowest-energy pathways for the hydrogenation on different surfaces. Guided by the theoretical prediction, Pd catalysts with a large particle size (26 nm) dominated by the close-packed (111) surface are synthesized and tested for selective acetylene hydrogenation in comparison with that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (particle size similar to 2 nm). We show that simple nanostructure engineering improves markedly the selectivity by 16 times, from 4.5% for the commercial Pd catalyst to 76% for our designed Pd catalysts at 100% acetylene conversion and 293 K, showing great promise for machine learning-guided catalyst design. General guidelines to further improve catalyst selectivity are proposed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700004

As two main intermediates in HCHO transformation, the conversion of dioxymethylene (DOM) to formate is one of the key steps. There are three recognized pathways for this step, including direct dissociation of DOM, DOM combining with surface O, or through a Cannizzaro-type reaction. Herein, we reveal that the catalytic reaction between DOM and the abundant surface OH groups is a facile pathway for the transformation of DOM to formate species on TiO2 and also on TiO2-supported noble metal catalysts. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results demonstrate that the presence of water vapor is favorable for the conversion of DOM to formate species on TiO2, and the loading of noble metals (Ir/Pt) on TiO2 further promotes the activation of H2O, thereby boosting the transformation of DOM into formate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that HCHO consumes the bridging OH groups to form DOM species first followed by the reaction between DOM and the terminal OH groups on the TiO2 surface to produce formate, and the latter reaction is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. These results provide deeper insight into HCHO transformation and demonstrate another role of surface hydroxyl groups in catalytic reaction.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700005

This method allows for simultaneous monitoring of reactants and products in the gas phase and species adsorbed on the surface during the reaction. The results were compared with the hydrogenation of propyne using Pd-free Cu(111) as well as with previous studies on Pd/Cu SAA catalysts supported on alumina. Propene production occurs at temperatures of 383 K and above as indicated by the appearance of an infrared peak at 912 cm(-1), which is a unique characteristic feature of gas phase propene. Propyne was found to adsorb on the surface at 300 K in the presence of gas phase propyne to form a di-s/di-p structure, as the spectrum was identical to that reported in the literature for propyne adsorbed on Cu(111) at 150 K in ultrahigh vacuum. The presence of a carbonaceous layer on the surface is indicated by a dramatic increase in the intensity of a peak at 2968 cm(-1) at temperatures above 400 K. The progression of gas phase peaks at 912 and 3322 cm-1 was used to calculate the rate of production of propene and the rate of consumption of propyne, respectively. This reaction rate was used to determine a turnover frequency of 25.4 s(-1) at 383 K for the reaction on the Pd/Cu(111) SAA surface. The reaction was not impeded by the presence of the carbonaceous layer, even for a layer so thick that only carbon was detectable on the surface with Auger electron spectroscopy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700006

High-valent transition-metal sites have been considered as OER active sites; however, the rational design and construction of these sites remain a big challenge. Here, we report a trimetallic NiFeCu oxyhydroxide electrocatalyst, in which high-valent Ni sites are promoted and stabilized by the atomically embedded Cu, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Through compositional optimization, Ni6Fe1Cu1 catalysts achieved an overpotential of 385 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 164 mV dec(-1), and a stability of 100 h at pH = 7.2. Density function theory calculations demonstrated that the Cu-doping facilitates the formation of high-valent Ni and thus promotes OER electrocatalysis through modulating the d-band center of Ni and reducing the adsorption energy of oxygenated intermediates on the surface of the catalyst. This work paves a promising avenue for the construction of desired high-valent metal OER catalysts by embedding redox inactive metals.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700007

All the polymers show better performance than TiO2, and the hybrid materials (only 10 wt % of polymer loading) show a higher hydrogen evolution rate than the sum of their components. The best value is recorded for the IEP-7@T-10 sample which shows 12-fold higher HER than the sum of its individual bare materials. Also, this sample with 1 wt % photodeposited platinum as cocatalyst shows a photonic efficiency (xi, %) of 14.54, 4.4-fold higher than the photonic efficiency of Pt/TiO2, in the same conditions. The combination of time-resolved fluorescence with transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements with the use of electron and hole scavengers allows us to determine an effective charge transfer mechanism Type II as mainly responsible for the improved photocatalytic activity.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700013

Traditional synthetic methods for Pt alloy catalysts involve impregnation of two metal salts onto high surface area supports followed by thermal reduction to form an alloy, which frequently results in inhomogeneous alloying and phase segregation of excess metal oxides in the material. In this work, we utilize colloidal methods to synthesize supported Pt-In and Pt-Ga nanoparticles with controlled bimetallic composition. The supported colloidal nanoparticles display phase uniformity while eliminating large excesses of In and Ga oxides, which allows us to ascertain the role that the bimetallic phase and composition play in tuning the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst in both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Indeed, the promoter-rich PtIn2 phase shows the highest turnover rate for ethane dehydrogenation, which we attribute to both the strong electronic perturbation to Pt sites observed in Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and the major geometric change at the surface upon formation of the CaF2 crystal structure adopted by PtIn2. Finally, we show that the promoter-rich colloidal nanoparticles are more thermally robust than incipient wetness impregnation catalysts of the same composition because they eliminate two deactivation pathways-reduction and vaporization of unalloyed promoter atoms-that only occur on the structurally nonuniform impregnated catalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700014

Experimental mechanistic investigations on a representative ligand system established that the reaction rate is zeroth order in the concentration of the borylating agent HBpin, first order in [alkyne] and in [Ir], and inverse first order in [H-2]. These findings are understood as arising from the formation of the saturated, 18-electron resting state (PNP)IrH(3)Bpin (5a), which is required to dissociate H-2 in order to enter the C-H oxidative addition reaction with the alkyne. However, the overall highest transition state corresponds to the B-H rotation following C-H oxidative addition. This realization follows from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and is consistent with the modest experimentally determined kinetic isotope effect of 1.5(1) for C-H/C-D. DFT-calculated Delta G(298)double dagger = 17.6 kcal/mol and Delta H = 13.9 kcal/mol match the experimentally determined values (Delta G(298)double dagger = 20(2) kcal/mol and Delta H double dagger = 16(2) kcal/mol) reasonably well. DFT calculations were used to demonstrate that the boryl migration from the amido N to Ir is too high in energy to play a part in the DHBTA mechanism in the (PNP)Ir system. This is in surprising contrast to the seemingly closely related (SiNN)Ir system studied previously. DFT calculations further provide insights into the greater kinetic barrier for activating a C-H bond of a terminal alkyne trans to a boryl ligand versus trans to a hydride, explaining why diboryl Ir compounds are not catalytically competent in this system.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700015

Above 300 degrees C, the carbon-depositing Boudouard reaction competes with the FTS reaction for CO as reactant. By making use of a combined in situ X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD)/Raman spectroscopy setup, the simultaneous evolution of the FexOy/alpha-Fe/FexC phases and various formed carbon species has been monitored at 340 degrees C and 10 bar. CO carburized, Na-S promoted and unpromoted Fe(-Na-S)/alpha-Al2O3 catalysts were investigated. The various Fe phases present were quantified with Rietveld quantitative phase analysis (R-QPA) from the in situ collected XRPD patterns. The observed D- and G-bands in the in situ Raman spectra were analyzed for their relative intensities, band widths, and positions and compared to reference carbon materials. It was found that amorphous carbon with C sp(3) and C sp(2) in chain-like ordering evolved toward carbon nanofiber-like structures during FTS. Na-S promotion and initial CO carburization at temperatures >= 340 degrees C led to an increased amount of cyclic sixfold C sp(2) species. Preliminary carbon deposits present in the catalysts decreased the initial fast increase of the Raman band intensities, while Na-S promotion increased Raman band intensity growth after the initial fast increase period. The carbon species evolution was unaffected by the presence of specific Fe carbides or by carbide-to-carbide transitions. Na-S promotion aided in the reduction of Fe3O4 by (H-2:)CO to carbon-depositing Fe carbides. The results obtained add to our further understanding on the role of Fe and carbon species during a high-temperature FTS reaction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700016

Metal-catalyzed cross-coupling and nucleophilic aromatic substitution are among the most reliable methods to access functionalized arenes. In these reactions, haloarenes are often used as a versatile synthetic platform to introduce various functional groups. However, haloarenes are typically prepared from the corresponding nitroarenes through the classic sequence of reduction, diazotization, and halogenation. Thus, haloarene cross-coupling can become a multistep transformation overall. To avoid this lengthy sequence, the direct utilization of nitroarenes has the potential to significantly streamline synthetic processes and, therefore, has attracted attention in the chemistry community from the vantage points of atom- and step-economy. In this Review, we comprehensively cover advances in transition-metal-catalyzed denitrative reactions of nitroarenes.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700017

Using Pd/NHC complex as a precatalyst, regioselective addition of thiols to cyclopropyl acetylenes was successfully performed, leading to densely functionalized compounds in excellent selectivity (up to 99:1) and high yields (up to 99%). Formation of Markovnikov-type products by insertion of alkyne into the Pd-S bond was confirmed experimentally. Molecular dynamics of the alkyne insertion into the Pd-S bond was performed computationally to identify key factors controlling the remarkable regioselectivity of this process. The fundamental question of how a small difference in activation energies can result in very high regioselectivity has been addressed by experimental methods combined with computational modeling. We show that the insertion of alkyne into the Pd-S bond proceeds by an asynchronous mechanism, which starts with metal-carbon binding and resolves into diverse transient structures. We further demonstrate that dynamic involvement of these structures ensures regioselectivity of the entire process, thus providing a mechanistic link that has long been missing. Alkyne insertion into the metal-heteroatom bond is a fundamental elementary step and a corner stone of catalysis and organometallic chemistry that works for a large variety of metals and heteroatoms. Mastering its Markovnikov vs anti-Markovnikov selectivity provides powerful opportunities for the design of selective functionalization routes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700018

However, nitrogen doping results in distinct modifications to their visible light absorption. Na/La ordering in the structure of NaLaTiO4 brings interesting structural features that are critical to a wealth of important factors such as nitrogen uptake, defect concentration, microstructures, and so forth. In sharp contrast to nitrogen-doped Sr2TiO4 (i.e., Sr2TiO4-xNy) whose photocatalytic activity is negligible under visible light illumination, nitrogen-doped NaLaTiO4 (i.e. NaLaTiO4-xNy) demonstrates very high activities for both photocatalytic water reduction and oxidation reactions. High apparent quantum efficiency similar to 3.2% at 420 +/- 20 nm has been recorded for NaLaTiO4-xNy, outperforming many other active metal oxynitride photocatalysts investigated under similar conditions. Theoretical calculations reveal that Na/La ordering incurs a strong electric field across Ti(O, N)(6) octahedron layers and breaks the coplanar settlement of highest occupied molecular orbitals and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals which are helpful to inhibit intralayer charge recombination.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700019

This protocol is characterized by high yields under environmentally benign reaction conditions and allows the regioselective and chemoselective functionalization of activated double bonds. Besides the synthetic utility of the shown transformation, this study undergirds the exclusive role of copper in photoredox catalysis as the title transformation is not possible via the most commonly employed ruthenium, iridium, or organic dye-based photocatalysts owing to the ability of copper to stabilize and interact with radical intermediates in its coordination sphere. Furthermore, the protocol can be smoothly scaled to gram quantities of the product, which offers manifold possibilities for further transformations, for example, heterocycle synthesis or intramolecular cyclopropanation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700020

Ionic additives and electrolyte ions can serve as promoters for specific reaction pathways. The judicious addition of these charged species thus represents a rich chemical strategy for tuning the electrode-electrolyte interface to achieve high product selectivity and catalytic activity. We have previously shown that trace amounts of surfactant can efficiently suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and promote the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) toward CO and HCOO- on a polycrystalline Cu foil working electrode. The major focus of herein study is to identify the impact of a model surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), on the double-layer structure in the presence of different alkali metal cations during electrocatalytic CO2RR. We postulated that the alkali cations and the positively charged surfactant headgroup will compete for a position at the negatively biased Cu electrode, leading to potentially synergistic effects on the catalytic performance. Indeed, it was observed that the positively charged trimethylammonium surfactant molecules effectively displace the alkali cations and suppress HER. However, the CO2RR activity and selectivity are nearly independent with respect to the identity of the alkali cations (Li+, Na+, and K+) in the presence of CTAB. Cesium cations defy this trend, where high HCOO- activity is observed. A molecular model of the double layer is proposed where CTAB molecules are competing for a position at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), resulting in only a small concentration of electrolyte cation at the electrode surface in the presence of CTAB. Furthermore, we postulate that the decrease in C2H4 activity is due to interfacial hydrophobicity caused by surfactant accumulation. We expect that these fundamental understandings will lead to advanced strategies for designing efficient organic additive to modulate the double-layer structure and optimize for selective small-molecule activation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700021

It is thought that strong, direct, and permanent electric fields within the active site of the enzyme contribute to the superb catalytic efficiency of enzymes. This effect is called electrostatic preorganization. Most often, electrostatic preorganization is analyzed by evaluating the local electric field at discrete points, such as a bond center, using, for example, vibrational Stark spectroscopy. However, the protein macromolecule creates a significantly more complicated heterogeneous electric field that affects the entire active site, whose total change density thus gets perturbed, with implications for the catalytic mechanism. We present a global distribution of streamlines method to analyze the topology of the heterogeneous electric fields within an enzyme active site. We focus on ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), an enzyme known to produce a field on the order of 100 MV/cm along the critical carbonyl bond in the steroid substrate. We investigate how mutations known to cause activity changes and applied small external electric fields perturb the electric fields in the KSI active site. When classical single-point analysis failed, our method allowed us to properly correlate global changes in the electric field with changes in the reaction barrier. We were able to show that topologically similar local electric fields had similar reaction barriers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700022

Despite recent significant advances in C-H functionalization chemistry, this strategy remains unsatisfactorily developed. In this report, we disclose a simple and straightforward protocol to allow for the selective C-H functionalization of unprotected double-benzannellated N-heterocycles via gold-catalyzed carbene-transfer reactions (29 examples, up to 86% yield). The scope of the reaction can also be expanded to the corresponding protected heterocycles (37 examples, up to 98% yield), further demonstrating the generality of this method. Mechanistic studies by density functional theory (DFT) calculations underpin the importance of the gold catalyst and reveal that the selectivity of this reaction is driven by trace amounts of water present in the reaction mixture.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700023

However, the limit of static catalyst performance defined by the Sabatier principle has motivated a dynamic approach to catalyst design, whereby catalysts oscillate between varying energetic states. In this work, the concept of dynamic catalytic resonance was experimentally demonstrated via the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid over Pt. Oscillation of the electrodynamic potential between 0 and 0.8 V NHE via a square waveform at varying frequency (10(-3) < f < 103 Hz) increased the turnover frequency to similar to 20 s(-1) at 100 Hz, over one order of magnitude (20x) faster than optimal potentiostatic conditions. We attribute the accelerated dynamic catalysis to nonfaradaic formic acid dehydration to surface-bound carbon monoxide at low potentials, followed by surface oxidation and desorption to carbon dioxide at high potentials.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700024

In this work, highly fluorescent aspartic acid-based carbon dots (CDs) are synthesized and employed as a photosensitizer to drive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with an [FeFe] hydrogenase (CrHydA1). The direct interaction in CDs from L-aspartic acid (AspCDs)/CrHydA1 self-assembly systems, which is visualized from native gel electrophoresis, has been systematically investigated to understand the electron-transfer dynamics and its impact on photocatalytic efficiency. The study discloses the significant influence of the electrostatic surrounding generated by sacrificial electron donors on the intimate interplay within the oppositely charged subunits of the biohybrid assembly as well as the overall photocatalytic performance. The system reaches an external quantum efficiency of 1.7% at 420 nm and an initial activity of 1.73 mu mol(H-2) mg(-1) (hydrogenase) min(-1) under favorable electrostatic conditions. Owing to the ability of the synthesized AspCDs to operate efficiently under visible light, in contrast to other materials that require UV illumination, the stability of the biohybrid assembly in the presence of a redox mediator extends beyond 1 week.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700025

Following synthesis by galvanic displacement, the nanowires had Pt surface areas of 90 m(2) g(Pt)(-1). The nanowire specific exchange current densities were 2-3 times greater than commercial nanoparticles and may benefit from the extended nanostructure morphology that avoids fringe facets and produces higher quantities of Pt{100}. Hydrogen annealing was used to alloy Pt and Ni zones and compress the Pt lattice. Following annealing, the nanowire activity improved to 4 times greater than the as-synthesized wires and 10 times greater than Pt nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the influence of lattice compression and exposed facet on the water-splitting reaction; it was found that at a lattice of 3.77 angstrom, the (100) facet of a Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt weakens hydrogen binding and lowers the barrier to water-splitting as compared to pure Pt(100). Moreover, the activation energy of water-splitting on the (100) facet of a Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt is particularly advantageous at 0.66 eV as compared to the considerably higher 0.90 eV required on (111) surfaces of pure Pt or Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt. This favorable effect may be slightly mitigated during further optimization procedures such as acid leaching near-surface Ni, necessary to incorporate the nanowires into electrolyzer membrane electrode assemblies. Exposure to acid resulted in slight dealloying and Pt lattice expansion, which reduced half-cell activity, but exposed Pt surfaces and improved single-cell performance. Membrane electrode assembly performance was kinetically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than Ni and slightly better than Pt nanoparticles while at one tenth the Pt loading. These electrocatalysts potentially exploit the highly active {100} facets and provide an ultralow Pt group metal option that can enable anion exchange membrane electrolysis, bridging the gap to proton exchange membrane-based systems.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700026

These materials exhibited superb electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. For example, the mass activity of a Pt45Cu55 film, at 0.90 V (vs RHE), was 3.5x higher than that of commercial Pt/C (40 wt % Pt). This activity enhancement is attributed, in part, to the ligand effect of the Cu component. The introduction of Au, as a third metal constituent to the porous films, further improved the ORR performance significantly. The synergistic effect(s) of Au and Pt appear to have a critical impact on the enhancement of the ORR activity. Compositional optimization identified the dealloyed Pt37Cu56Au7 porous film as the best performing electrocatalyst. It also exhibited the highest mass and specific activities (0.871 A/mg(Pt), 1.85 mA/cm(2)) which were 7.20x and 8.15x higher than those of commercial Pt/C (40 wt % Pt), respectively. This ternary alloy thin-film catalyst also exhibited the longest durability, among all tested samples in this study.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700027

In this work, PdBi ordered intermetallic (O-PdBi) nanoparticles were prepared in an effort to mitigate the formation of adsorbed species like COads through isolating the Pd atoms. The enhanced antipoisoning capability of O-PdBi, relative to Pd, gave rise to superior activity and stability during FAOR. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and CO stripping results indicated that COads could be removed more easily on O-PdBi compared with that on Pd. In situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy showed that the formation of COads on O-PdBi was effectively suppressed, while both the hollow and bridged COads were detected on Pd with continuous Pd sites. In addition to the higher content of Bi atoms on the Pd-Bi surface, the ordered atomic distribution has played an important role in this effect. This work demonstrates the superiority of ordered intermetallic Pd-based nanocatalysts and provides guidance for promoting stability in FAOR by precluding the formation of COads.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700028

However, the role Pse5Ac7Ac plays in host-pathogen interactions remains underexplored, particularly compared to its ubiquitous sialic acid analogue Neu5Ac. This is primarily due to a lack of access to difficult to prepare Pse5Ac7Ac glycosides. Herein, we describe the in vitro biocatalytic transfer of an activated Pse5Ac7Ac donor onto glycosyl acceptors, enabling the enzymatic synthesis of Pse5Ac7Ac-containing glycosides. In a chemoenzymatic approach, chemical synthesis initially afforded access to a late-stage Pse5Ac7Ac biosynthetic intermediate, which was subsequently converted to the desired CMP-glycosyl donor in a one-pot two-enzyme process using biosynthetic enzymes. Finally, screening a library of 13 sialyltransferases (SiaT) with the unnatural substrate enabled the identification of a promiscuous inverting SiaT capable of turnover to afford beta-Pse5Ac7Ac-terminated glycosides.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700029

However, the narrow substrate scope of wild-type TD limits its application. This issue could be overcome by engineering the substrate tunnel of the enzyme. Here, Corynebacterium glutamicum TD (CgTD) was used as a model, and its substrate tunnel was identified as a gating element. On the basis of the gating characteristics and constitution of the substrate access tunnel of CgTD, an "open-gate" strategy was developed to improve its substrate scope toward bulky substrates. The best variant obtained following this approach, CgTD(Mu7), exhibited 90.6-fold greater catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M) toward a bulky substrate such as phenylserine. The improvement was due to more efficient substrate coupling, deprotonation, and imine hydrolysis. CgTD(Mu7) was used for efficient production of both natural and unnatural a-keto acids, including 2-oxobutyric acid (83.4 g L-1, 99% conversion), phenylpyruvic acid (72.5 g L-1, 95% conversion), 2-oxovaleric acid (21.1 g L-1, 91% conversion), and 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid (29.9 g L-1, 84% conversion). The proposed strategy provides a theoretical basis for the synthesis of a-keto acids and is also effective for engineering other similar enzymes.									7	1	0	0	4	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700030

However, the synthesis of these compounds often requires selective protection/deprotection steps leading to waste and poor atom economy. Here we describe the truncation of a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) yielding an adenylation domain capable of selective amide bond formation under aqueous conditions. This truncated construct had a higher amidation activity compared to the full-length enzyme. The amidation reaction is mediated by ATP, which can be recycled from polyphosphate using a class III polyphosphate kinase (CHU). The wide substrate scope and selectivity of this enzymatic amidation method were confirmed through the synthesis of 24 pharmaceutically relevant amides including building blocks of six active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Moreover, up-scaling of selected examples, including two API's, was achieved demonstrating the value of this approach for synthesis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700031

However, its mechanism is not fully understood owing to the contrasting behaviors exhibited by several Fe catalysts. Indeed, whereas a few Fe catalysts exhibit an activity dominated by inductive effects, the activity of others reveal significant and even dominant radical delocalization. Therefore, no clear and general rationale of aziridination has yet emerged. Elaborating on our previous studies, we anticipated that replacing two pyridines of a pentanitrogen ligand by two quinolines would enhance the electron affinity of the corresponding imido FeIV active species and hence its aziridination activity. This proved to be the case, and Hammett correlations indicate an electrophilic active species and dominant inductive effects. The calculated reaction profile points to a two-step mechanism with the formation of the first C-N bond being rate-determining and involving a strong charge transfer in the transition state. The aziridine ring closure in the second step is almost barrierless. A clear correlation of aziridination yields with calculated EA for Fe-catalysts indicate that the dependence of aziridination efficacy on EA of active species is a quite general feature. To generalize this analysis, we reinvestigated a catalyst exhibiting a radical delocalization dominance. Indeed, a similar two-step mechanism was found, which involves a partial charge transfer in the C-N bond formation as all other cases. The interesting point is that owing to the strong steric hindrance of the catalyst substitution, the aziridine ring closure of the intermediate benzylic radical (second step) becomes rate-determining, thus explaining the dominance of the radical delocalization effect. Eventually, a general aziridination two-step mechanism has been rationalized, and EA thus appears as the key descriptor for Fe-based catalytic aziridination that can be used in a predictable way.									14	1	0	0	5	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700032

Significantly, K+-contained layered MnO2 catalysts have been verified as strong candidates toward catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO). Unveiling the effects of alkali metal ions on active sites is critical to understand the interaction between reactants and active centers. Through a combination of analytical tools with periodic computational density functional theory modeling, the surface structures and the exposing specific defects of alkali metal ions affiliated to oxygen vacancies (Vo) are figured out by comparing three typical alkali metal ion-intercalated (Na+, K+, and Cs+) layered MnO2 materials. These materials have been synthesized via a molten salt method, with high yield, large lateral size, and nanometer thickness in a few moments. We demonstrate that the alkali metal ions could remarkably alter the formation energy of Vo by the sequence of CsMnO (1.94 eV) < KMnO (1.97 eV) < NaMnO (2.07 eV) < ideal MnO2 surface without the intercalated ion (2.23 eV). As a result, CsMnO with the most surface Vo sites could achieve efficient HCHO oxidation to CO2, with a HCHO consumption rate of about 0.149 mmol/(g.h) at 40 degrees C in 200 ppm HCHO/humid air [gas hourly space velocity = 80,000 mL/(g.h)]. Different from the Mars-van-Krevelen process, quantum chemical calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy revealed that the main reaction pathway might be HCHO(ad) + [O](ad) -> DOM -> [HCOO-](s) -> CO2 via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. Alkali metals remarkably promoted the HCHO conversion by trapping oxygen through Vo sites and accelerating the facile reaction among adsorbed oxygen with adsorbed HCHO to deep degradation products (CO2 and H2O).									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700033

Herein, we report a carboxyl-directing strategy for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic gamma-ketoacids. With catalysis by iridium complexes bearing chiral spiro phosphino-oxazoline ligands, hydrogenation of aliphatic gamma-ketoacids afforded chiral gamma-hydroxylacids with high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). Mechanistic studies revealed that the carboxyl group of the substrate directs hydrogen transfer and ensures high enantioselectivity. Density functional theory calculations suggested the occurrence of chiral induction involving a hydrogen-hydrogen interaction between a hydride on the iridium atom and the substituent on the oxazoline ring of the ligand, and on the basis of the calculations, we proposed a catalytic cycle involving only Ir(III), which differs from the Ir(III)/Ir(V) catalytic cycle that operates in the hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acids.									6	2	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700034

These same agents can, however, strongly influence the catalytic performance of metal nanostructures in aqueous media. In this regard, the current literature describing the influence of ligands on the model catalytic reaction that sees 4-nitrophenol reduced to 4-aminophenol by borohydride is highly fragmented in that the understanding of reaction rate, induction time, and ligand desorption phenomena is disconnected and, at times, contradictory. Herein, we present a study in which three chemically distinct ligands are applied to bare gold catalysts followed by their exposure to aqueous solutions of relevance to 4-nitrophenol reduction while simultaneously tracking the ligand whereabouts. It is shown that the exposure of ligands to borohydride leads to their near-complete removal from the gold catalyst. This, in turn, gives rise to severe disruptions to the rate of 4-nitrophenol reduction for the scenario where the aqueous reactants are purged of dissolved oxygen and ligand desorption times are slow. In sharp contrast, the reaction rate is little affected when the same reactants contain dissolved oxygen because the resulting induction period provides ample time for the ligands to desorb prior to the onset of the reaction. Moreover, strongly bound ligands are shown to give rise to an induction-time-like feature that is only observable when the reactants are free of dissolved oxygen. Collectively, these findings advocate procedures for catalytic benchmarking that differ from current best practices and underscore the point that a fundamental understanding of 4-nitrophenol catalysis must adopt a holistic approach that accounts for ligand-nanostructure interdependencies.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700035

Catalysts with vanadium oxide (VOx) species immobilized over Zr-NU-1000 and Hf-MOF-808 (which have nodes containing six Zr-(IV) or Hf-(IV) ions, respectively) were recently characterized experimentally (Otake et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018, 140, 8652) and were reported to be active for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Here, we report a detailed computational investigation of these VOx-incorporated MOF catalysts (V-MOF) by employing density functional theory. Based on the mode of VOx attachment, various structures are explored, and their relative stabilities and computed IR spectral features are reported. Mechanisms for the selective oxidation reaction are investigated. The analysis of electron flow in the turnover-limiting C-H activation step shows that the hydrogen-atom abstraction process involves a concerted proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism. The results of this study suggest that in addition to the identity of the metal in the node, the MOF node architecture plays a crucial role in driving the catalytic activities of V-MOFs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700036

The active sites in this solid solution m-ZrO2:In catalyst are In-V-o-Zr sites (V-o is an oxygen vacancy) that are stabilized in the lattice of poorly reducible m-ZrO2 against deactivation by over-reduction to In-0. In contrast, the amorphous ZrO2 support does not form a (crystalline) solid solution with In2O3 and, as a result, In2O3/am-ZrO2 reduces to metallic In within minutes under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, a tetragonal ZrO2 support stabilizes dispersed india nanocrystals (In2O3/t-ZrO2) against over-reduction only partially, yielding a catalyst with an average oxidation state of the In sites below +2: i.e., In2O3/t-ZrO2 also suffers deactivation by over-reduction. Our results demonstrate that the phase of the ZrO2 support determines whether an active solid solution with india forms, which has major implications for the reducibility of In3+ sites and their local structure. Comparing the stability and activity of india-based catalysts, we identified the monoclinic solid solution m-ZrO2:In as a superior catalyst for the direct conversion of CO2 to methanol, which contains active In-V-o-Zr surface species that are significantly more stable toward reduction than In-V-o-In sites in bixbyite-type In2O3.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700037

Recently, single metal atoms (SMAs) immobilized on a conductive substrate have been shown as effective catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction, opening the door to a generation of low-cost and high-performance catalysts for fuel and chemical production. The unique physical and chemical properties of a single-atomic structure and the homogeneity of the active sites, combined with tunable coordination environments, are essential for realizing highly active and selective catalysts. In this Review, we focus on the structure-performance relationship in SMA catalysts for CO2 reduction from both theoretical and experimental aspects. We discuss why SMA catalysts exhibit a distinct catalytic performance compared to their counterpart nanoparticles. Recent strategies for improving the CO2 reduction selectivity and activity by tuning the nature and coordination environment of SMA active sites are described. Finally, we highlight potential applications of SMA catalysts in practical CO2 reduction conditions, critical challenges, and the path toward efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysis based on SMAs.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700038

The present study demonstrates that the sizes and dispersion of oxidized Pd islands present on oxidized Ag(111) in addition to the concentration of active Pd sites have a significant influence on the rate of surface reduction by H-2. Two distinct types of Pd oxide islands were generated for this investigation and characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy. Small, uniformly dispersed PdOx islands (1-5 nm diameter) were created by depositing Pd onto AgOx surfaces, while larger, non-uniformly dispersed PdOx agglomerates (30-50 nm) were produced by depositing Pd on Ag(111) prior to oxidizing. Based on XPS, the small PdOx islands have a higher concentration of undercoordinated Pd atoms than the large agglomerates. Both types of PdOx are found to dramatically enhance the reduction of AgOx by H-2 at 300 K due to the ability of PdOx to dissociate H-2; the pure AgOx surfaces are unreactive toward H-2. The rate of reduction at 300 K is found to be 2-4 times larger for the AgOx surface covered by small, uniformly dispersed PdOx islands. The higher reactivity of this surface is attributed to enhanced migration of oxygen and hydrogen atoms between the PdOx and AgOx phases due to the sizes and high dispersion of the small PdO islands as well as the higher concentration of active Pd sites on the PdOx domains. This study demonstrates that reactant migration between co-existing surface phases is highly sensitive to both the intrinsic chemical activity and morphological properties of the active phase (PdOx) and reveals that these properties can be significantly influenced by the method of synthesizing the oxidized bimetallic surfaces.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700040

From a cheap and air-stable [Fe(salen)](2)-mu-oxo complex and readily available pinacol borane (HBpin), a monomeric [FeH(salen)]center dot Bpin species formed in situ acts as the active catalyst. This species is shown to feature a hemilabile salen ligand stabilized via interactions with the boron entity. The formation, identity, and reaction mechanism of the active species are supported by complementary kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational data. The active catalyst undergoes hydrometallation of a coordinated alkyne to form a vinyl iron species, stepwise additions of two more alkynes across the Fe-C bond to form a pendant triene, which upon ring-closure forms the arene product. The catalytic cycle is closed by substitution of the product with the alkyne substrate. With the active [FeH(salen)]center dot Bpin catalyst, atom-efficient, intermolecular trimerization is shown with high regioselectivity for a diverse range of substrate substitution patterns and presence of functional groups.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700044

The rates of epoxidation, however, differ by orders of magnitude depending on the combination of an oxidant, an alkene, and a support used. Within Ti-BEA, the rates of 1-octene epoxidation with H2O2 are 30 and 170 times greater than reactions with TBHP or CHP, respectively. In contrast, 1-octene epoxidation rates in Ti-SBA-15 with H2O2 are 7- and 40-fold higher than in reactions with TBHP or CHP, respectively. Moreover, comparisons of 1-alkene (C-6-C-10) epoxidations within Ti-BEA and Ti-SBA-15 show that the turnover rates depend differently on the length of alkene reactants depending on the oxidant identity, which is due to complex interactions among the alkene, the activated oxidant, and the solvent-filled pore of the Ti-silicate. Thermochemical analyses of apparent activation free energies within a Born-Haber cycle reveal three distinct contributions that affect catalysis, which include charge transfer between Ti-OOR and C=C functions within the transition state; the adsorption of the alkene into the silicate pores; and the structural rearrangement of the reactive Ti-OOR intermediates and solvent to accommodate the alkene. First, epoxidations with H2O2 give the highest rates among these oxidants because Ti-OOH intermediates are more electrophilic than Ti-OOtBu or Ti-OOcumyl species as a consequence of electron donation from alkyl groups that increase intrinsic barriers for O-atom transfer. Second, differences in the epoxidation rates between Ti-BEA and Ti-SBA-15 largely reflect the changes in the stability of the alkenes adsorbed within the pores of each silicate. Third, the distinct sensitivities of epoxidation rates on oxidant identity within Ti-BEA and Ti-SBA-15 are caused by differences between the inner-sphere interactions among Ti-OOR intermediates and adsorbed alkenes that depend on the surrounding environment. We present a thermodynamic model that quantitatively describes how inner-sphere interactions among epoxidation transition states depend on the steric bulk of the reacting species and how these interactions are conferred by the topology of the surrounding pore. The mesopores of Ti-SBA-15 allow transition states to access conformations that lower the free energy of the complex relative to analogous transition states in Ti-BEA, which explains why epoxidation rates in mesoporous solids are less sensitive to the identity of the oxidant than within microporous silicates.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700045

Isolated Ru sites were successfully implanted into the structure of the MOF by simply stirring the mixed liquor containing both MOF and RuCl3, facilitating plasma discharge, NO/NO2 adsorption, and formation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals. A special oxo-bridged Zr4+-O-Ru3+ was constructed to accelerate electron transfer and continuous proceeding of the reaction. Directional migration of generated electrons from MOF to Ru sites was witnessed when MOF was activated by plasma-induced "pseudo-photocatalysis". The total (100%) selective plasma-catalytic oxidation of NOx to NO2- and NO3- was achieved at an SIE of 75.3 J/L. The byproduct O-3 was effectively degraded and utilized by MnO2, facilitating the deep oxidation of NOx. The facile realization of single atoms would be an ideal way to produce MOF-based catalysts with desired performance. Efficiently combining plasma with single atom-decorated MOF catalysts can provide additional prospects for the plasma-catalytic system.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700046

Here, we report our findings in electrochemical NRR for ammonia synthesis using porous bimetallic Pd-Ag nanocatalysts in both gas-phase and liquid-phase electrochemical cells at current densities above 1 mA cm(-2) under ambient conditions. While the gas-phase cell has lower Ohmic losses and higher energy efficiency, the liquid-phase cell achieved higher selectivity and Faradaic efficiency, attributed to the presence of concentrated N-2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte and the hydration effects. The liquid cell demonstrated notable performance for electrocatalytic NRR, achieving an NH3 production rate of 45.6 +/- 3.7 mu g cm(-2) h(-1) at a cell voltage of -0.6 V (vs RHE) and current density of 1.1 mA cm(-2), corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 19.6% and an energy efficiency of similar to 9.9%. Similarly, the gas-phase cell achieved a NH3 yield rate of 19.4 +/- 2.1 mu g cm(-2) h(-1) at -0.07 V (vs RHE) and 1.15 mA cm(-2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 7.9% and an energy efficiency of 27.1%. Further, operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) are used to identify intermediate species relevant to the NRR at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces to provide insights into the NRR mechanism on Pd-Ag nanoparticles. This work highlights the importance of design and optimization of cell configuration in addition to the modification of the catalyst to achieve high-performance N-2 electrolysis for ammonia synthesis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700047

This problem is particularly complex for reactions that occur at the metal-support interface (MSI) because of the multiple chemistries associated with the metal and the support. In this study, we used the oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohol over Au/TiO2 and Au/Al2O3 to probe MSI chemistry. Substituents impacted substrate binding, deprotonation, and the rate-limiting transfer of a hydride from benzyl alcohol to Au, as shown by a combination of Michaelis-Menten (M-M) saturation kinetics and kinetic isotope effects. Hammett studies performed with a single substrate versus those done with two substrates together in competition experiments showed significant differences, which were attributable to stronger competitive adsorption on the support by more electron-rich alcohols. The M-M analysis showed that alcohol substitution impacts substrate binding and deprotonation equilibria, which in turn affect the number of active alkoxides adsorbed at the MSI. Hammett slopes should therefore be measured under saturating conditions using one substrate at a time. The Hammett slopes measured for heterogeneous systems in this manner agree well with the KIE-Hammett slope relationship determined in homogeneous systems, which provide information on the early or late nature of the transition state. Our results show that the combination of Michaelis-Menten and Hammett techniques for benzyl alcohol oxidation provides mechanistic information associated with the MSI chemistry of supported Au catalysts as well as information on active site electronics.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700048

The concentration of copper was varied between 0 and 10 wt %, while the concentration of CeO2 was varied between 0 and 48 wt % in several permutations of Cu/CeO2/ZSM-5 catalysts. RWGS reactivity trends revealed that all three components of the catalyst system are essential for promoting and sustaining the optimum catalytic activity. The dynamic chemical states of copper and cerium were probed using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure), revealing reduced copper and mostly oxidized ceria in the active state. In situ X-ray diffraction data revealed the presence of copper aggregates, as well as copper within the ZSM-5 lattice. In situ and isotopic switching diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy analyses were used to unambiguously establish copper speciation within the ZSM-5 lattice and CeO2 surface sites as participatory in the RWGS mechanism, with surface formate species on CeO2 being a reaction intermediate. Based on a robust set of real-time structural, electronic, and surface chemical data, we proposed a reaction mechanism that involves the participation of all three components of this catalyst system.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700049

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission CO-IR of the reduced catalyst, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy are used to identify the surface structure of NPs with different P/Ru atomic ratios, changing from Ru to Ru2P to RuP with increasing P loading. In addition to improving the olefin selectivity, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to higher turnover rates and lowers the deactivation rate. P is thought to act as a structural promoter to reduce the Ru ensemble size, decreasing the hydrogenolysis rate. In addition, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to a decrease in the energy of the Ru valence orbitals, which are suggested to weaken metal-adsorbate bond energies and reactant surface coverages.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700051

Recently, two types of biosynthetic pathways were reported. In the aerobic ergothioneine biosyntheses, non-heme iron enzymes incorporate a sulfoxide into an sp(2) C-H bond from trimethyl-histidine (hercynine) through oxidation reactions. In contrast, in the anaerobic ergothioneine biosynthetic pathway in a green-sulfur bacterium, Chlorobium limicola, a rhodanese domain containing protein (EanB), directly replaces this unreactive hercynine C-H bond with a C-S bond. Herein, we demonstrate that polysulfide (HSSnSR) is the direct sulfur source in EanB catalysis. After identifying EanB's substrates, X-ray crystallography of several intermediate states along with mass spectrometry results provide additional mechanistic details for this reaction. Further, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations reveal that the protonation of N-pi of hercynine by Tyr353 with the assistance of Thr414 is a key activation step for the hercynine sp(2) C-H bond in this trans-sulfuration reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900002	34306804

We identified three OSCs from Iris tectorum. ItOSC2 is a rare multifunctional alpha-amyrin synthase. Sequence comparisons, site-directed mutagenesis, and multiscale simulations revealed that three spatially clustered residues, Y531/L256/L258, form an unusual Y-LL triad at the active site, replacing the highly conserved W-xY triad occurring in other amyrin synthases. The discovery of this active site architecture in ItOSC2 underscores the plasticity of terpene cyclase catalytic mechanisms and opens avenues for protein engineering toward custom designed OSCs.									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900046	34306805

Computational analysis indicates that the triplet excited state of these complexes shows an oxyl radical behavior, while the Sb-V center remains in a high-valent oxidation state, serving uniquely to carry the oxo moiety and activate the coordinated ligands. This porphyrin-based system has been exploited upon irradiation to catalyze C-H to C-C bond conversion via the addition of hydrogen donors (ethers and aldehydes) onto Michael acceptors in a redox-neutral fashion without the need of any external oxidant. Laser flash photolysis experiments confirmed that the triplet excited state of the photocatalyst triggers the desired C-H cleavage.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900008	33815891

The definition of the IMC catalysts allowed for more direct connections to be made between catalyst bulk and surface compositions and catalyst performance in wet reforming. We show that Ni + Ga catalysts exhibit comparable or better rates of reaction on a per-site basis and improved stability in comparison to other leading formulations. We also demonstrate excellent control over product selectivity as a function of Ni + Ga IMC bulk and surface compositions with nearly ideal selectivity toward CO2/H-2 or CO/H-2 achieved. Selectivity toward the production of smaller hydrocarbons could also be suppressed significantly due to uniquely limited rehydrogenation kinetics of the Ni + Ga IMCs. Our studies also shed light on the stability of Ni + Ga IMCs under reaction conditions and how high conversion in reactions that involve many strongly bound reaction intermediates can lead to IMC phase relaxation to the most stable phase with concomitant surface composition and catalytic performance changes. Correlations between surface chemistry and catalyst performance were afforded by both the well-defined nature of the IMCs and computational surface science studies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900001

However, the specific roles of such supports remain to be demystified owing to the difficulties in obtaining precise structural information on supported catalysts. To understand the effects of MOF topology, pore environment, and metal identity of node supports on the catalytic activity, a Ni catalyst was supported on eight Zr- or Hf-MOFs based on 8-connected nodes: namely M-NU-1200, M-NU-1000, M-NU-1008, and M-NU-1010 (M = Zr, Hf). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the supported catalyst structures. To investigate the support effects on their activities, the supported Ni catalysts were evaluated by using ethylene hydrogenation as a model reaction. The results revealed that all Hf-based-MOF-supported Ni catalysts exhibited higher catalytic reactivity with TOF (turnover frequency) values at least double of those isostructural Zr counterparts. Additionally, MOFs with less congested metal anchoring sites, as a result of the topology and surrounding pore environment, yielded higher TOFs, suggesting the importance of supports in dictating both the catalyst accessibility and activity. Computational analysis complemented the experimental observations and provided insights into reaction barrier differences and their performance variation. This study demonstrates the essential role of the supports and provides a thought for selecting/designing suitable supports in heterogeneous catalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900003		
J	Stratakes, Bethany M.; Miller, Alexander J. M.								H-2 Evolution at an Electrochemical "Underpotential" with an Iridium-Based Molecular Photoelectrocatalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	16			9006	9018		10.1021/acscatal.0c02265				AUG 21 2020	2020	Molecular platforms capable of both photochemical H-2 evolution and electrochemical catalyst regeneration hold promise for the efficient generation of solar fuels. Systems studied to date require a significant electrochemical overpotential (eta), so no photon energy is being chemically stored. A detailed study of the parameters that govern the electrochemical overpotential of molecular photoelectrocatalysts is presented. By understanding how tuning the solvent, catalyst structure, and acid pK(a) affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of the potential- and light-driven H-2 evolution reaction, conditions were identified wherein the solvento complex [Cp*Ir(bpy)(NCCH3)][PF6](2) (Cp* is pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl; bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine) mediates photoelectrocatalytic H-2 formation at an electrochemical "underpotential" (eta < 0) driven by visible light. Under 460 nm illumination and in the presence of the weak organic acid H-PhTMG(+) (2-phenyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidinium), the catalyst facilitates H-2 evolution with Faradaic efficiencies up to 90% and overpotentials as low as -90 mV. Mechanistic studies enabled the construction of graphical "maps" that can guide the choice of catalyst and conditions to minimize overpotential, applicable to both photoelectrocatalysts and dark electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900004

In this work, TiO2-x was employed to regulate active Fe species to the electron-rich state, causing remarkable synergetic effects in which the sulfur removal rates of Fe-based catalysts were increased by 10-40% and reaction rate constants were also increased by around 100% (pure Fe-based catalysts) and 30% (Fe-Zn bimetallic catalysts). The results of characterization and DFT calculations show that the strong electron-donating effect of TiO2-x on Fe species can promote the dispersion of Fe species and weaken the Fe-O and Fe-S/FeZn-S bonds, resulting in the increases in sulfidation degrees by around 3.5% and enrichments of coordinatively unsaturated sites or sulfur vacancies. In addition, weaker Al-OH peaks caused by TiO2 can also facilitate the increase in sulfidation degrees of Fe-based catalysts. Furthermore, hydrodesulfurization/direct desulfurization ratios are decreased by adding TiO2-x, attributed to the electron-rich Fe species that makes C-S bonds and alpha/beta-H more vulnerable to attacks.

However, owing to unsuitable redox capacity, most NH3-SCR catalysts such as MnO2/TiO2 and MnO2-CeO2/TiO2 suffer from poor activity and N-2 selectivity and SO2 poisoning. Benefiting from constructing mesoporous MnCeSmTiOx amorphous mixed oxides by the coprecipitation method, enhanced SO2-tolerant low-temperature NH3-SCR performance was achieved. The MnCeSmTiOx catalysts have an amorphous and mesoporous structure with a BET surface area of 214 m(2) .g(-1). The NO conversion could reach nearly 100% at 140-320 degrees C and maintain >90% at 400 degrees C and a gas hourly space velocity of 80,000h(-1). The selectivity of N-2 could be maintained at approximate to 100% at 100-320 degrees C and stay at >90% up to 400 degrees C. Besides, the MnCeSmTiOx catalyst preserves higher catalytic performance after introducing H2O and SO2 compared with the catalysts without adding Sm. The redox properties, acidic properties, and reaction intermediates of catalysts were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption, oxygen temperature-programmed desorption, pyridine-IR, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform. The synergistic effect of the Lewis acid sites and oxidation catalytic sites of mixed oxides serves for the conversion of NO to N-2 by following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. Doping Sm into MnCeSmTiOx can increase oxygen vacancies and transfer electrons to Mn4+ and Ce4+, which facilities the formation of active adsorbed NO2, bidentate nitrate, and bridging nitrate intermediates and suppresses SO2 poisoning by inhibiting the oxidation of SO2 by Mn4+ and Ce4+. Our work could be beneficial to modulate the redox capacity of active sites on NH3-SCR catalysts so that NOx can be eliminated in complex flue gas at low temperatures.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900006

These indude molecular homogeneous catalysts incorporating various ligands, enzymes, and solids that include pairs of metal atoms mounted on supports. Catalysts in this broad class are active for numerous reactions and offer unexplored opportunities to address challenging reactions, such as oxidation of methane and oxidation of water in artificial photosynthesis. The subject of supported metal pair-site catalysts is in its infancy, facing challenges in (a) precise synthesis, (b) structure determination at the atomic scale, and (c) stabilization in reactive atmospheres. In this Perspective, we summarize key characteristics of molecular and enzymatic catalysts that incorporate neighboring metal centers and build on this foundation to assess the emerging literature of metal pair-site catalysts on various supports. The supported catalysts include those synthesized by anchoring molecular dinuclear precursors to support surfaces and those synthesized by selective formation of dinuclear surface species from mononuclear surface species. Examples of metals in this dass are rhodium and iridium, and examples of supports are MgO and Fe2O3. We summarize characterization of these materials by electron microscopy and spectroscopy, emphasizing atomic-resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopies that provide atomic-scale structural information and allow characterization of functioning catalysts, especially X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We list some opportunities for research, including suggestions that might lead to structurally well-defined supported metal pair-sites with new catalytic properties.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900009

Monometallic phosphides such as Ni2P have been shown to be active toward OER, but their performance remains unsatisfactory. Herein, guided by the theoretical mechanism study of the intrinsic high electroactivity revealed in the d-band center (E-d) theory, the Fe-substituted Ni2P ((NixFe1-x)(2)P) nanosheets grown directly on NiFe foam are designed and synthesized. As OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media, the (NixFe1-x)(2)P nanosheets show an overpotential of 166 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the Ni2P and most reported transition-metal-based catalysts. Combining DFT simulations with experiments reveals that the enhanced activity results from the moderate rise in E-d energy levels, which balances the adsorption and desorption capacities of the oxygen-containing intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH). This work supplies valuable insights for the rational design and construction of efficient doped electrocatalysts under the guidance of the d-band center theory.									43	0	0	0	2	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900010

However, the interpretation of the structure-reactivity relationship caused by different crystal types of carriers and the metal-support interface is not well understood. Herein we synthesized ZrO2 -supported Cu nanoparticle catalysts via different preparation methods and reduction temperatures under similarly exposed surface facets and Cu valency but different polymorphic phases of ZrO2 (monoclinic ZrO2: m-ZrO2; tetragonal ZrO2: t-ZrO2) and the metal-support interface. Interestingly, the as-synthesized Cu/t-ZrO2 catalysts showed remarkably better catalytic performance than Cu/m-ZrO2 for the in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid in the methanol-water system. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results ascribed the lower efficiency of m-ZrO2 as a carrier to weakly adsorbed reactant and intermediate molecules as well as the absence of an oxygen vacancy in the crystal phase. The interface-rich Cu/t-ZrO2 catalysts displayed higher activity normalized to the surface-exposed Cu sites toward lauryl alcohol production than the interface-deficient counterparts. DFT calculation results further revealed that this metal-support interface plays an important role in promoting the C-O bond or H-H bond cleavage in two possible reaction routes, thus reducing the activation barrier of the overall reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900011

However, the difficulty in activating the methyl group of biomass and simultaneously promoting the C-C coupling makes photocatalytic reforming still a great challenge. Herein, through the first-principles simulation calculation of the energy barrier of acetone dehydrogenation and conversion over a series of noble metal single atom (Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au)-loaded TiO2 (MSA-TiO2) photocatalysts, we predict a Pt single atom-loaded TiO2 (PtSA-TiO2) photocatalyst that can enable methyl activation, CH3COCH2 center dot radical formation, and hydrogen production most effectively from acetone, which is very significant for the synthesis of high-value-added multicarbon compounds by C-C coupling. This is well confirmed by our photocatalytic experiments, revealing that PtSA-loaded commercial P25-TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic activity of 3.87 mmol g(-1)h(-1) for the direct coproduction of high-value-added 2,5-hexanedione (HDN) and hydrogen from acetone with a selectivity of 93%, at least 13-fold higher activity than other noble metal (Ru, Rh, and Ir) single atoms or Pt nanoparticle-loaded ones. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy reveals that the PtSAs contribute to the effective methyl activation and simultaneously promote the formation of more intermediate CH3COCH2 center dot radicals, which are further confirmed by in situ electron spin resonance spectroscopy.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900012

Determinations of rates of catalyzed alcohol oxidations and ketone reductions, and of cofactor release, pointed out to the role of a W295A substitution as being decisive in steering enantioselectivity in the oxidation of arylated 1-methyl substituted alcohols. Molecular dynamics simulations of enzyme-substrate interactions in the Michaelis complexes of wild-type ADH-A and a Y294F/W295A double mutant could rationalize the experimentally observed shift in enantioselectivity and differences in catalytic activity with 4-phenyl-2-butanol. Finally, we present herein evidence for apparent interdependency between substrate/product and the cofactor in the ternary complex, which directly affects the NADH dissociation rates; therefore, this substrate-coenzyme crosstalk plays a direct role in determining the turnover rates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900013

Different transition metals have been screened using electronic structure methods by estimating onset potentials from the most endergonic elementary reaction step. We calculate onset potentials for the oxygen reduction reaction on metal atoms embedded in N-substituted graphene di-vacancies by virtue of first-principles-informed microkinetic analysis. We find that for more oxophilic metals (Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ru), purely thermodynamic models systematically underestimate onset potentials. Furthermore, the oxophilic metals (Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ru) are oxidized under reaction conditions, leading to an increase in activity compared to their reduced state. Importantly, coadsorbed OmHn species actively participate in the reaction, which requires a dynamic treatment of spectator species. These findings highlight the limitations of thermodynamic analyses for electrocatalytic processes, which commonly assume the same oxidation state for each metal, and show that deviations between computational and experimental onset potentials cannot be solely attributed to the shortcomings of the electronic structure methods.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900014

Extensive synthesis and step-wise screening of over 600 dipeptide derivatives were performed for the efficient evolution of decoy molecules. In the presence of N-(3-cyclopentyl)propanoyl-L-pipecolyl-L-phenylalanine (3CPPA-Pip-Phe), one of the most effective decoy molecules discovered herein, the catalytic turnover frequency and total turnover number for benzene hydroxylation reached 405 min(-1) P450BM3(-1) and 54,500 P450BM3(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the decoy molecules developed in this work drastically accelerated the hydroxylation of other non-native substrates, such as anisole and toluene, as well as nonaromatic compounds, such as cyclohexane, propane, and ethane. Using N-enanthoyl-L-pipecolyl-L-phenylalanine (C7AM-Pip-Phe), the hydroxylation rate for ethane to ethanol reached 82.7 min(-1) P450BM3(-1).									3	0	0	0	0	1	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900015

Biocatalysis is preferred as it can be performed under mild reaction conditions, in an aqueous environment, and can involve benign oxidants (molecular oxygen) and biodegradable catalysts (enzymes and cells). Whole cells and isolated enzymes have both been demonstrated effectively catalyze the biotransformation of HMF (5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural) to FDCA. Whole cell biocatalysts are robust and benefit from endogenously produced cofactors (which are otherwise expensive stoichiometric reagents). However, wild-type organisms suffer from catabolic pathways which yield many side products and catabolize FDCA. Thus, whole cells require metabolic modification to favor certain pathways and eliminate others to be viable. With clear pathways and simple reaction conditions, isolated enzymes allow for better control and easier product recovery. However, no individual enzyme effectively catalyzes the full oxidation of HMF to FDCA, and thus, cofactors, mediators, immobilization, mutation, or cooperation with other enzymes is employed to achieve complete oxidation. Herein, a comprehensive review of the biocatalytic methods for converting HMF to FDCA is presented. Moreover, general strategies for alcohol and aldehyde oxidation are also discussed to provide a more complete context.									10	0	1	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900016
