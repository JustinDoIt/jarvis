While numerous works were devoted to understand the effect of the electrolyte composition on the physical properties of the catalysts' surface, very little is known yet about its exact impact on the OER kinetics parameters. In this work, we reveal that the origin for the electrolyte-dependent OER activity for Co-based catalysts originates from two different effects. Increasing the alkaline electrolyte concentration for La1-xSrxCoO3-delta perovskites with x > 0 and for amorphous CoOOH increases the pre-exponential factor, which can be explained either by an increase of the concentration of active sites or by a change in the entropy of activation. However, changing the alkali cation results in a decrease of the apparent activation enthalpy for Fe-containing amorphous films, traducing a change in intermediates' binding energies.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000018		
J	Wei, Changcheng; Yu, Qijun; Li, Jinzhe; Liu, Zhongmin								Coupling Conversion of n-Hexane and CO over an HZSM-5 Zeolite: Tuning the H/C Balance and Achieving High Aromatic Selectivity								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4171	4180		10.1021/acscatal.9b05619				APR 3 2020	2020	The coupling conversion of n-hexane (a model compound of naphtha) and CO was conducted over an HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. A significant increase in the aromatic selectivity and dramatic decrease in the alkane selectivity were simultaneously achieved by adjusting the H/C ratio of the reactants. Under suitable conditions, the aromatic selectivity was 80%, which far exceeds the theoretical value for the conversion of only n-hexane over HZSM-5. Detailed studies revealed that the high aromatic selectivity originated from the direct incorporation of CO into the products. Different characterization methods were used to elucidate the coupling reaction mechanism. Important reaction intermediates, such as acyl groups and oxygenates (substituted cyclopentenones), were detected. Isotope labeling studies revealed that oxygenates were formed by (CO)-C-13 incorporation into alkyl species, and they could transform into aromatic products. Based on these findings, a plausible reaction mechanism of the coupling transformation was proposed. The coupling effect between n-hexane and CO over HZSM-5 demonstrated in this work contradicts the traditional view that metal catalysts are indispensable for the highly selective conversion of naphtha to aromatics. This type of coupling reaction might have great potential for industrial applications, considering the large existing supply capacities of CO and alkanes.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000019

Significant primary kinetic isotope effects have usually been interpreted as being a result of isotope substitution at a site of bond breaking (or forming) in the rate-determining step in the reaction mechanism. However, quantitative analysis of the magnitude of the KIE in complex multistep reaction mechanisms is seldom reported. We prove here that the logarithm of the rate ratio for two isotopes is the weighted average over all species in the mechanism of their standard-state free-energy difference between the two isotopes, divided by RT. The weighting factor is the degree of rate control (DRC) for that species (e.g., transition state, intermediate, reactant) when the rate is measured separately for each isotope. It is instead the degree of selectivity ratio control (DSRC) when the KIE is measured as the product selectivity in a parallel competition between two isotopes within the same reactant molecule. Since only a few species have nonzero DRCs (or DSRCs) for most reactions, only these few contribute to this weighted average and the KIE. We show that this provides a simple way to interpret and quantitatively predict kinetic isotope effects that is powerful in the insights it provides, allowing one to evaluate directly which species contribute most to the KIE. By applying it to H/D KIEs in several example mechanisms, we further show that the traditional way of interpreting KIEs that focuses only on the rate-determining step can easily lead to misunderstanding of KIE and the reaction mechanism. This highlights the importance to consider the effect of isotope substitution on the energies of all species with large DRCs (i.e., those whose energies are kinetically relevant). This method also offers opportunities for quantitative validation of mechanism-based microkinetic models.									8	0	1	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000020

High-resolution HAADF-STEM coupled with in situ and tomographic analyses have been undertaken on a platinum (Pt) active phase supported on chlorinated alumina (gamma-Al2O3) with 0.3 and 1 wt % Pt loadings, highlighting the formation of flat nanoparticles (NPs) of 0.9 nm diameter and Pt single atoms (SAs) in the reduced state. While SAs and weakly cohesive clusters are predominantly observed in the oxide state, with a coordination sphere of Pt composed of O and Cl as revealed by EXAFS, the ratio between SAs and Pt NPs in the reduced state is found to be about 2.8. This ratio is the same for the two metal loadings: both the total numbers of NPs and SAs increase at a higher metal loading. Electron tomography reveals that the vast majority of NPs are located on the edges or defects (steps, kinks) of the.-alumina support crystallites. DFT calculations further highlight the optimized structures of NPs located at the gamma-Al2O3 (110)-(100) edge and near-edge with a stability competing with NPs located either on the (110) or on the (100) gamma-Al2O3 facet. A mathematical analysis of the segmented volumes shows that the average geodesic distances between NPs is linked to Pt loading: 9 nm for 1 wt % Pt and 16 nm for 0.3 wt % Pt. Evaluation of support tortuosity descriptors using the nanoparticle positions confirms a uniform distribution on the support. A square network geometric model compatible with the geodesic distances between NPs reveals that one to five NPs can be present at the same time on each alumina crystallite depending on Pt loading.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000021

However, it is rather challenging to fabricate such particular structures that can remain intact in harsh electrochemical environments, as such Pt-based nanocatalysts are unable to simultaneously achieve both unparalleled activity and robust stability. Here, a facile surface engineering strategy is proposed and employed to atomically tailor the near-surface structure of the Pt1.5Ni octahedra. The engineered Pt-Ni octahedra consist of an ultrathin Pt-rich shell (similar to two atomic layers) and Pt-rich bulk composition. The optimized octahedral catalyst exhibits superior specific and mass activity (7.7 mA/cm(2) Pt and 1.9 A/mg Pt at 0.9 V) for ORR, similar to 20 and similar to 10 times higher than commercial Pt/C, respectively. The ligand and strain effects arising from the near-surface engineering are unraveled to be responsible for the remarkable ORR activity. Moreover, it shows robust stability with just 9.2% decay in mass activity after accelerated degradation tests (ADTs), as its compositional nature prevents surface Pt atoms and interior Ni atoms from diffusion and dissolution, compared with a decrease of 33% for commercial Pt/C. Our atomical engineered surface strategy illustrates a facile and effective design for a class of Pt-based nanocatalysts with excellent activity and stability.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000022

Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical study that reveals how the addition of small amounts of atomically dispersed Pt at the metal/oxide interface dramatically enhances the reducibility of a Cu2O thin film by H-2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results reveal that, upon oxidation, a PtCu single-atom alloy (SAA) surface is covered by a thin Cu2O film and is, therefore, unable to dissociate H-2. Despite this, in situ studies using ambient-pressure (AP) XPS reveal that the presence of a small amount of Pt under the oxide layer can, at the single-atom limit, promote the reduction of Cu2O by H-2 at room temperature. We built two density functional theory based surface models to better understand these experimental findings: a Cu2O/Cu(111)-like surface oxide layer, known as the "29" oxide, in which Pt is alloyed into the Cu(111) surface, as well as a PtCu SAA. Our calculations suggest that the increased activity is due to the presence of atomically dispersed Pt under the surface oxide layer, which weakens the Cu-O bonds in its immediate vicinity, thus making the interface between subsurface Pt and the surface oxide a nucleation site for the formation of metallic Cu. This initial step in the reduction process results in the presence of surface Pt atoms surrounded by metallic Cu patches, and the Pt atoms become active in H-2 dissociation, which consequently accelerates the reduction of the oxide layer. This work demonstrates how isolated Pt atoms at the metal/oxide interface of a Cu-based catalyst accelerate the reduction of the oxide and, therefore, help maintain the active, reduced state of the catalyst under the reaction conditions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000023		
J	Bugnola, Marco; Shen, Kaiji; Haviv, Eynat; Neumann, Ronny								Reductive Electrochemical Activation of Molecular Oxygen Catalyzed by an Iron-Tungstate Oxide Capsule: Reactivity Studies Consistent with Compound I Type Oxidants								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4227	4237		10.1021/acscatal.0c00897				APR 3 2020	2020	The reductive activation of molecular oxygen catalyzed by iron-based enzymes toward its use as an oxygen donor is paradigmatic for oxygen transfer reactions in nature. Mechanistic studies on these enzymes and related biomimetic coordination compounds designed to form reactive intermediates, almost invariably using various "shunt" pathways, have shown that high-valent Fe(V)=O and the formally isoelectronic Fe(IV)=O porphyrin cation radical intermediates are often thought to be the active species in alkane and arene hydroxylation and alkene epoxidation reactions. Although this four decade long research effort has yielded a massive amount of spectroscopic data, reactivity studies, and a detailed, but still incomplete, mechanistic understanding, the actual reductive activation of molecular oxygen coupled with efficient catalytic transformations has rarely been experimentally studied. Recently, we found that a completely inorganic iron-tungsten oxide capsule with a keplerate structure, noted as {Fe30W72}, is an effective electrocatalyst for the cathodic activation of molecular oxygen in water leading to the oxidation of light alkanes and alkenes. The present report deals with extensive reactivity studies of these {Fe30W72} electrocatalytic reactions showing (1) arene hydroxylation including kinetic isotope effects and migration of the ipso substituent to the adjacent carbon atom ("NIH shift"); (2) a high kinetic isotope effect for alkyl C.H bond activation; (3) dealkylation of alkylamines and alkylsulfides; (4) desaturation reactions; (5) retention of stereochemistry in cis-alkene epoxidation; and (6) unusual regioselectivity in the oxidation of cyclic and acyclic ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids where reactivity is not correlated to the bond disassociation energy; the regioselectivity obtained is attributable to polar effects and/or entropic contributions. Collectively these results also support the conclusion that the active intermediate species formed in the catalytic cycle is consistent with a compound I type oxidant. The activity of {Fe30W72} in cathodic aerobic oxidation reactions shows it to be an inorganic functional analogue of iron-based monooxygenases.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000024

Of these cocatalysts, the combination of palladium and tin showed the highest synergistic behavior and peak hydrogen gas production at a low relative fraction of palladium. The resulting palladium/tin bimetallic cocatalysts were characterized, and specifically, and scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated that palladium and tin elements reside within the same particle. The experimental catalytic activity for the palladium/tin mixture was compared to density functional theory-derived energy values associated with the adsorption of hydrogen onto a surface. This comparison demonstrated that the typical peak found in electrochemical Sabatier volcano plots at Delta G(H)* = similar to 0 eV were replicated in the experimental photocatalytic system with a peak activity observed at Delta G(H)* = -0.036 eV. Computational confirmation of the results expressed here demonstrates the efficacy of colorimetric detection of hydrogen in parallel and presents a model for increasingly rapid catalyst screening.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000026

P450s tailoring natural product could further oxidize the hydroxyl to carboxylic acid. However, heterogeneously expressed plant P450s display poor chemo- and regioselectivity in microbes, restricting the efficient biosynthesis of related natural products. CYP72A63 is a P450 enzyme previously used for the biosynthesis of glycyrrhetinic acid, and its poor selectivity resulted in oxidation of 11-oxo-beta-amyrin to a mixture of rare licorice triterpenoids (glycyrrhetol, glycyrrhetaldehyde, glycyrrhetinic acid, and 29-OH-11-oxo-beta-amyrin). In this study, we have identified key residues, which influence the enzyme-substrate hydrophobic interaction, in controlling the chemo- and regioselectivity of the enzyme and engineered the enzyme toward selectivity oxidation to hydroxyl and carboxylic acid. Moreover, tuning the redox partner of the P450 leads to selective production of glycyrrhetaldehyde, a good starting point for further modification. In this study, controlling the catalytic property of plant P450s prove to be of great use in the synthesis of desired licorice triterpenoids, which can be used in biosynthesis of other terpenoid natural products.									16	6	0	0	10	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000027

Herein, we describe that nickel phosphide nanoparticles (Ni2P NPs) act as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the selective transformation of biofuranic aldehydes into diketones, which is a useful biorefining technology. The biofuranic aldehydes are hydrogenated in water without any additives, giving the corresponding diketones in high yields. The catalytic performance of Ni2P NPs demonstrated here is significantly different from conventional Ni(0) and NiO NPs, and other metal phosphide NPs, which show no activity, indicating the unique catalysis of Ni2P NPs. Spectroscopic analyses showed that bifunctional Ni2P NP catalysis combining their hydrogen-activating ability and surface acidity plays a crucial role, leading to the transformations of selective biofuranic aldehydes.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000028

However, catalysts with a high degree of structural heterogeneity, such as commercial TiO2 powders, are not well-suited to establish rigorous structure-function relationships at an atomic level. Here, we provide compelling evidence for the effects of surface orientation of TiO2 catalyst on elimination reactions of alcohols. Two anatase titania model catalysts, with preferential exposure of (101) and (001) facets, were synthesized and studied for 2-propanol dehydration using kinetic, isotopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic measurements, coupled with DFT calculations. Surface Lewis acid sites were found to be active for 2-propanol dehydration, and (101) facets are more reactive than (001) facets under the reaction conditions studied. On both anatase surfaces, 2-propanol was found to dehydrate via concerted E2 elimination pathways, but with different initial states and thus also different intrinsic activation barriers. Molecular 2-propanol dehydration dominates on TiO2 (101) while on TiO2 (001), 2-propanol simultaneously converts to more stable 2-propoxide before dehydration, which then requires higher activation energies for E2 elimination.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000029

Under standard peptide coupling/deprotection conditions, the tBu-nic-equipped amino acid amides proved to be fully inert, allowing them to be easily built-in in complex molecules.

Herein, we report preparation of Pd(111) nanosheets (NS) onto carbon-supported WNi substrates using CO as a reducing and capping agent. Such PdNS/WNi layers can significantly enhance the ORR performance of a PdNS/WNi/C catalyst in alkaline and a PtML/PdNS/WNi/C catalyst in acidic media. The dominating Pd(111) facets and consequently diminished low-coordination sites enhanced their electrocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the inhibition of Pd-O formation bonds even at 1.1 V due to the presence of WNi/C substrates and additional shape-induced contraction caused by the slight Pd dissolution at the side edges resulted in the improvement in durability. Furthermore, the stability of the carbon supports was improved because of the protection from the well-covered WNi substrates.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000031

The formed cycloalkenes including cyclopentene and cyclohexene in the MTO reaction show high reactivity toward formation of aromatics. Cyclohexene tends to form cyclopentene through ring contraction, and the subsequent ring expansion leads to the production of aromatics. The ring-contraction/expansion process of cyclohexene is consistent with the C-13 isotopic scrambling in aromatics. Solid-state NMR experiments evidenced the formation of cyclopentenyl cations and benzenium ions intermediates in the aromatization of C6 cycloalkenes. A plausible route to link the alkene-based and aromatic-based cycles in the MTO reaction on ZSM-5 zeolite was proposed, which is corroborated by DFT calculations.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000032

Mechanistic Characterization of the Fusicoccane-type Diterpene Synthase for Myrothec-15(17)-en-7-ol								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4306	4312		10.1021/acscatal.0c00377				APR 3 2020	2020	Fusicoccane (FC)-type diterpenes, featuring a common 5-8-5 tricyclic skeleton, possess diverse biological functions. Currently, only FC-type diterpene synthases (DTSs) for 3 of the 16 possible stereochemically distinct subtypes of the FC skeleton have been discovered. Herein, a (2si,6si,10re,14si)-FC-type DTS from Myrothecium gramineum is reported, which produces the diterpene alcohol myrothec-15(17)-en-7-ol. On the basis of homology modelings, the I189F variant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis that prevents the penultimate carbocation from water attack, resulting in the deprotonation product myrotheca-7,15(17)-diene. Vibrational circular dichroism calculations in combination with chemical correlations through an enantioselective labeling strategy established the absolute configurations of these diterpenes. Density functional theory calculations revealed a water-mediated proton transfer mechanism, which is supported by isotope labeling experiments, in contrast to the deprotonation/reprotonation mechanism reported in previous studies.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000033

This O* mechanism predicted reasonable ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of Co/N/C but abnormally underestimated the one of Fe/N/C. Herein, we highlight an unconventional 2OH* ORR mechanism (O-2 -> OOH* -> 2OH* -> OH* -> H2O), which was often ignored because the free energies (Delta G) of 2OH* and O* are equal, according to the famous scaling relation: 2 Delta G(OH*) = Delta G(O*). This scaling relation is true for traditional catalysts with near-continuous active sites. We find a different scaling relation: Delta G(2OH*) = Delta G(O*) + 1.5 eV on single-atom catalysts (Me/N/C, Me = Fe, Co, etc.) and suggest that the 2OH* mechanism should not be overlooked. In consideration of both O* and 2OH* mechanisms, the ORR E-1/2 values of Co/N/C and Fe/N/C are in good agreement with experimental results. This work reveals the structure dependence of ORR reaction mechanisms and scaling relations in single-atom catalysis, and it is also heuristic for other reactions, such as O-2 evolution and N-2 reduction on single-atom catalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000034		
J	Peters, Baron								Secondary Effectiveness Factors and Solubility Effects for Catalytic Reactions in Series								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4319	4325		10.1021/acscatal.0c00185				APR 3 2020	2020	Thiele moduli and effectiveness factors are powerful ways to account for mass transfer limitations on reactions occurring within porous catalyst particles. Effectiveness factors have been developed for numerous rate laws, geometries, and nonisothermal situations, but not for reactions in series. This manuscript develops an effectiveness factor for the second step in the A -> B -> C reaction sequence with first-order kinetics and slab geometry. The expressions are more complicated than the familiar primary effectiveness factors because the intermediate B is being generated and consumed within the catalyst particle. We illustrate the application of the secondary effectiveness factor by modeling the conversion from A to B and C for plug flow through a porous ceramic monolith catalyst. Then we modeled A -> B -> C in a slurry of catalyst flakes within a well-stirred batch reactor, including equilibrium solvent-molecular sieve partition coefficients for the A and B species. When both Thiele moduli are small and the molecular sieve adsorbs A more strongly than B, the second reaction is suppressed. This situation can give essentially 100% yield of B, even when A and B have similar reactivities within the catalyst. Our results provide a framework for predicting the effects of interior mass transfer limitations and solvent-solid phase partitioning in heterogeneously catalyzed series reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000035

In this work, we investigated the mechanism of CO2RR to CO on CoPc via experimental reaction kinetics coupled with model fitting. Unexpectedly, reactant order dependences and Tafel slopes deviate from commonly expected values and change depending on the testing conditions. For example, (1) the effect of bicarbonate deviates from power law kinetics and transitions from inhibitory to promotional with increasingly reductive potential, and (2) the CO2 order dependence deviates from unity at more-reductive potentials. We propose a kinetic model, chosen from more than 15 candidate models, that is able to quantitatively fit all of the experimental data. The model invokes (1) catalyst poisoning via bicarbonate electrosorption, (2) mixed control between concerted protonelectron transfer (CPET) and sequential electron transfer-proton transfer (ET-PT), and (3) both water and bicarbonate as kinetically relevant proton donors. The proposed model also predicts that the relative importance of the above factors changes depending on the reaction conditions, highlighting the potential downfalls of broadly applying reaction mechanisms that were inferred from kinetic data collected in a narrow range of testing conditions. This study emphasizes the importance of cohesively using kinetic data collected over a wide range of operating conditions to test and formulate kinetic models of electrocatalytic reactions.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000036

Elucidation of mechanism involving catalytic enantioselective transformation with racemic substrates is often challenging. Herein, we provide mechanistic insights derived through a comprehensive density functional theory (B3LYP-D3) investigation, on the origin of stereoinduction in a Rh-catalyzed asymmetric allylic arylation of racemic 3-chlorocyclohex-1-ene by using arylboronic acid. Energetically most preferred pathway is found to proceed through (a) a transmetalation wherein aryl group gets transferred from the boron of arylboronic acid to the Rh center of the catalyst, (b) an oxidative addition (OA) of Rh to the C-Cl bond of cyclohexenyl chloride, and (c) a reductive elimination (RE) leading to the bond formation between the Rh-bound phenyl and cyclohexenyl moiety to furnish the final arylated product. We note that each enantiomer of the substrate follows different OA modes, which is highly suggestive of a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT). Although the likelihood of DYKAT has been routinely invoked in the literature, quantitative energetic details, as well as mechanistic underpinnings such as the identity of the common intermediate, generally remain scarce. The R enantiomer of cyclohexenyl chloride is found to undergo an anti-S(N)2' OA, whereas the S enantiomer prefers an anti-S(N)2 route to the common prochiral eta(3)-Rh-pi-allyl intermediate. High enantioselectivity in the ensuing RE, favoring the S enantiomer of the product, is traced to the lower activation barrier, which, in turn, arises from the lower distortion energy in the RE transition state when the si face of Rh-bound cyclohexenyl forms the bond with the phenyl group than when the re face is involved. The mechanistic insights presented herein are expected to be valuable toward understanding the DYKAT mechanism of conversion of racemic substrates to an enantiopure product.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000038

We use a newly developed electrochemical technique to compare the performance of a range of catalysts with initial composition Pt4-xCox/C of different particle sizes at high current densities (similar to 0.65 V vs RHE) as well as the typical similar to 0.9 V vs RHE. Moving from 0.9 to 0.65 V, the current densities were found to increase by up to 80-fold for the Pt/C catalysts, with this factor decreasing as the amount of Co in the PtCo alloy increases. A kinetic model incorporating site blocking species at both high and low potentials has been used to explain this change. While the dealloyed catalysts were found to have a greater mass activity at low current densities (similar to 0.9 V vs RHE), they were no longer as active as 2.1 nm Pt particle catalyst at high current densities (similar to 0.65 V vs RHE). However, for equivalent particle sizes, the mass activity of the dealloyed Co-containing catalysts remains higher across the normal operating potentials of a fuel cell. Using this insight, we predict that at 0.65 V a catalyst composed of 3.8 nm CoPt@Pt1ML particles would give optimum mass activity performance. In addition, two peaks were observed during the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on pure Pt nanoparticles in the hydrogen adsorption region (0-0.4 V vs RHE). These peaks are associated with surface sites with different reactivities toward the ORR.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000039

The strategy has two essential components: a set of multifidelity features (e.g., composition and electronic structure) and probabilistic models with Gaussian processes trained with ab initio data for predicting activity descriptors (i.e., *O and *OH adsorption energies). By iteratively validating/refining the candidates which have theoretical overpotentials <0.5 V, albeit with large uncertainties, we attain machine learning models (RMSE < 0.5 eV) that can rapidly navigate through a chemical subspace of similar to 4000 double perovskites (AA'B2O6) and single out stable structures with promising OER activity. Our approach successfully identified several known perovskites with improved catalytic performance over the benchmark LaCoO3 along with 10 other candidates that have not been reported. Importantly, by analyzing the feature distributions of better and worse catalysts than LaCoO3, we draw molecular orbital insights into physical factors governing the OER activity.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000040

Although common Lewis acids are able to provide efficient activation, the reactions often proceed with low regio- or chemoselectivity, while high selectivity frequently requires the use of well-designed metal-ligand complexes. Here we demonstrate that simple Lewis acids including Me2AlCl, FeCl3, and SnCl4 can show remarkable selectivity in differentiating between distinct transformations of carbonyl and olefin functional groups, resulting in either carbonyl-ene or carbonyl-olefin metathesis products. Specifically, we report the development of predictive multivariate linear regression models that rely on kinetic and thermodynamic information obtained in DFT calculations to gain important insights into the complex potential energy surfaces (PES) of these competing reaction paths. The presented results further our understanding of Lewis acid reactivity and suggest that even simple Lewis acids have the potential to function as highly selective catalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000042

Previously, the position of a hydroxyl on a series of hydroxylpicolinate ligands was found to significantly influence the activity of molecular iridium catalysts in sacrificial oxidant driven water oxidation. In this study, these catalysts were tested under electrochemical conditions and benchmarked to several other known molecular iridium catalysts under the exact same conditions. This allowed us to compare these catalysts directly and observe whether structure-activity relationships would prevail under electrochemical conditions. Using both electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we found that all studied iridium complexes form an iridium deposit on the electrode with binding energies ranging from 62.4 to 62.7 eV for the major Ir 4f(7/2) species. These do not match the binding energies found for the parent complexes, which have a broader binding energy range from 61.7 to 62.7 eV and show a clear relationship to the electronegativity induced by the ligands. Moreover, all catalysts performed the electrochemical water oxidation in the same order of magnitude as the maximum currents ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 mA cm(-2) once more without clear structure-activity relationships. In addition, by employing H-1 NMR spectroscopy we found evidence for Cp* breakdown products such as acetate. Electrodeposited iridium oxide from ligand free [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) or a colloidal iridium oxide nanoparticles solution produces currents almost 2 orders of magnitude higher with a maximum current of 11 mA cm(-2). Also, this deposited material contains, apart from an Ir 4f(7/2) species at 62.4 eV, an Ir species at 63.6 eV, which is not observed for any deposit formed by the molecular complexes. Thus, the electrodeposited material of the complexes cannot be directly linked to bulk iridium oxide. Small IrOx clusters containing few Ir atoms with partially incorporated ligand residues are the most likely option for the catalytically active electrodeposit. Our results emphasize that structure-activity relationships obtained with sacrificial oxidants do not necessarily translate to electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, other factors, such as electrodeposition and catalyst degradation, play a major role in the electrochemically driven water oxidation and should thus be considered when optimizing molecular catalysts.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000043	32280560

Herein, a Co-based heterostructure consisting of cobalt (Co) and molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles in a 2D morphology is purposely designed as an OER precatalyst. At the initial stage of the OER in alkaline solution, the fast phase transition of Co metal into gamma-phase cobalt oxyhydroxide (gamma-CoOOH) in the presence of Mo2C gives rise to a Mo-enriched surface of the defective gamma-CoOOH. This significantly raises the OER kinetics and gives an almost 90% enhancement in catalytic activity per metal site. Interestingly, the phase transition to gamma-CoOOH and Mo-enriched surface reconstruction are potential-dependent and are accelerated at 1.4 V, as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy as well as ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy studies. Potential-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses and methanol oxidation experiments further confirm that the Mo enrichment into the defective CoOOH surface promotes electron flow from Mo to Co sites via the bridging oxygen, greatly benefiting the electrostatic adsorption of OH- ions and smoothing the subsequent OER steps.									45	2	0	0	2	0	46			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000044

The bifunctional GFF, serving as both the catalyst support and light absorber, is decorated with MnO2 nanofins, forming a hierarchical fin-on-fin structure. The results show that the MnO2/GFF catalyst can effectively capture and convert renewable solar energy into heat (absorption of >95%), leading to a temperature rise (55.6 degrees C) of the catalyst bed under solar irradiation (1 sun, light intensity 1000 W m(-2)). The catalyst weight (9.8 mg) used in this work was significantly lower (10-100 times lower) than that used in previous studies (usually 100-1000 mg). Introducing solar energy into the typical PPC process via solar thermal conversion significantly enhances the conversion of toluene and CO2 selectivity by 36-63%, reaching similar to 93% for toluene conversion and similar to 83% for CO2 selectivity at a specific input energy of similar to 350 J L-1, thus remarkably reducing the energy consumption of the plasma-catalytic gas cleaning process. The energy efficiency for toluene conversion in the solar-enhanced post-plasma catalytic (SEPPC) process reaches up to 12.7 g kWh(-1), similar to 57% higher than that using the PPC process without solar irradiation (8.1 g kWh(-1)), whereas the energy consumption of the SEPPC process is reduced by 35-52%. Moreover, the MnO2/GFF catalyst exhibits an excellent self-cleaning capability induced by solar irradiation, demonstrating a superior long-term catalytic stability of 72 h at 1 sun, significantly better than that reported in previous works. The prominent synergistic effect of solar irradiation and PPC with a synergistic capacity of similar to 42% can be mainly attributed to the solar-induced thermal effect on the catalyst bed, boosting ozone decomposition (an almost triple enhancement from similar to 0.18 gO(3) g(-1) h(-1) for PPC to similar to 0.52 gO(3) g(-1) h(-1) for SEPPC) to generate more oxidative species (e.g., O radicals) and enhancing the catalytic oxidation on the catalyst surfaces, as well as the self-cleaning capacity of the catalyst at elevated temperatures driven by solar irradiation. This work opens a rational route to use abundant, renewable solar power to achieve high-performance and energy-fficient removal of volatile organic compounds.									18	0	0	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000045	32296596

Multiwall carbon nanotubes of varying wettability and doped with Ru nanoparticles were tested as catalysts and stabilizers of biphasic emulsions in a batch reactor under FTS reaction conditions (H-2:CO = 4:1, 220 degrees C, 55 bar). First, in comparison to the runs conducted in pure organic solvent, both rate and selectivity increased with the addition of a second (aqueous) phase. Likewise, a large increase in reaction rate was found when a second (organic) phase was incorporated, relative to that measured in pure aqueous phase. Notably, this rate increase was more substantial when the nanotubes employed were more hydrophobic and exhibited higher oil wettability. At the same time, for a given (Ru/CNT) catalyst, the rate increased with the oil/water solvent ratio, suggesting that not only the promotion by water but also the interaction of the catalyst surface with the organic solvents at the oil/water interfaces plays a key role in enabling higher rates. Because the rate changes are not due to changes in rates of mass transfer, it is concluded that the intrinsic kinetics was enhanced. Among the possible explanations for the enhanced kinetics, we discuss here some concepts recently proposed in the literature, including the water-promotion of H-assisted CO dissociation and the disruption of dense CO surface layers by the organic solvent.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000046

Although extensive studies have been devoted to the preparation of secondary and tertiary fluorides, crucial shortcomings remain: for example, lengthy substrate synthesis, contrived installation of difficult-to-remove directing/activating units, excessive waste generation and/or limited functional group compatibility. Here, we show that readily accessible alpha-onofluoro carboxylic acids, which are conventionally difficult substrates for cross-coupling, undergo direct decarboxylative crosscoupling with sp(2-) and sp(3-)hybridized organohalides to afford a wide assortment of fluorinated products. Reactions are typically promoted by a combination of 1 mol % of an Ir-based photocatalyst and 2-15 mol % of a bipyridine-Ni complex, delivering products in up to 86% yield under blue LED light irradiation. Concise synthesis of key therapeutic candidates underscores utility, complementarity, and distinct advantages compared with existing methods. DFT calculations are used to rationalize the distinct reactivity of alpha-fluoro carboxylic acid substrates (vs nonfluorinated parent acids) under decarboxylation conditions.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000048

Given the increasing interest in metallocorroles as electrocatalysts, the current study addressed the water-oxidizing ability of mononuclear and two types of binuclear iron corroles: mu-oxo bridged and linked through beta-pyrrole C atoms. This disclosed the modulation of electronic factors for lowering the electrochemical onset potential for water oxidation by the monomeric iron corroles and the fact that the C-C-linked dimer outperforms both the monomer and the mu-oxo dimer as a WOC. Parallel investigations on the corresponding bis-cobalt dimer uncovered it to be the best catalyst not only in terms of efficacy but also with regard to the stability of the catalytically active species.

Herein, we describe the nickel-catalyzed intermolecular carbobrominations of alkynes with aryl bromides to form highly substituted and functionalized alkenyl bromides. The reductive elimination of the carbon-bromine bond from a Ni(II) species, which is usually a disfavored process, is achieved from a high-valent Ni(III) species in this reaction. This transformation not only expands the scope of transition-metal-complex-promoted bond-forming reactions but also, more particularly, accomplishes the formation of labile bonds, which is as challenging to achieve as the cleavage of inert bonds, such as C-O or C-H bonds.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500028

Despite many catalyst systems developed, the state-of-the-art solutions are still limited to special alkynes. A practical catalyst, which could be used to cross-dimerize general aryl alkynes and aliphatic alkynes, is still highly desired. Herein we present the earth-abundant Co(II)-catalyzed highly gem-selective cross-dimerization of aryl alkynes and aliphatic alkynes or gas acetylene under mild reaction conditions. Conjugated 1,3-enynes with various useful functional groups can be prepared in high yields. The application of Co(OAc)(2) and t-butyl group substituted triphos ligand is essential to distinguish the alkynes at different steps and realize the gem-selectivity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500042

The transformation relies on acylimidazoles, easy-to-prepare and flexible species derived from abundant carboxylic acids, as viable cross-coupling partners for the Ni-catalyzed acylation. Careful examination revealed a remarkable mechanism: the amide C-N bond of primary and secondary imidazolides can be activated by single-electron reduction, representing a major departure from other reported amide C-N bond activation reactions. Extensive mechanistic studies also revealed an intriguing CO-extrusion-recombination phenomenon. This cross-coupling reaction between two electrophiles features a broad substrate scope bearing a wide gamut of functionalities. The practicality of this atypical transformation was demonstrated in the syntheses of 3-furyl natural products, which are difficult to access using traditional organometallic chemistry.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500044

Efficient assembly strategies of pyridones are transition metal-catalyzed C-H annulations with alkynes. The inaccessibility and extreme lability of fluoro alkynes render any direct utilization in catalysis futile. We report a highly regioselective synthesis of 4-fluoro-2-pyridones using 1-alkynyl triazenes as a convenient fluoroalkyne surrogates. The protocol comprises an alkenyl C-H annulation with 1-alkynyl triazenes followed by a treatment with HF center dot pyridine smoothly delivering a broad range of 4-fluoro-2-pyridones in a one-pot fashion in 90 min at 23-60 degrees C. Notably, a rare Lossen rearrangement occurs during the C-H functionalization part of the transformation, allowing selective access to the less-available 4-fluoro-2-pyridone framework. Furthermore, the triazenyl intermediate was elaborated into additional fluorine-containing substituents like fluorinated alkoxy and trifluoromethyl groups.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500030

The plausible reaction mechanism involves two catalytic cycles: in the first one, silver ions regioselectively catalyze the C-C bond formal insertion reaction; in the second one, silver ions chemo- and regioselectively control the cyclization and [1,5]-shift reactions. This method not only provides convenience and applies atom economy in the synthesis of multisubstituted pyrroles but also presents an entry point for further pyrrole diversification via facile modification of resulting 4H-pyrrole products, as displayed by a short formal synthesis of the natural product lamellarin L.									19	1	0	0	5	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500024

The reactions proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to afford the corresponding [4 + 2] cycloadducts in high yields with good enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1 dr). DFT calculations demonstrated that carbonyl coordination of the chiral ligand to Cu(II) was crucial for the high stereoinduction. These CBOA ligands exhibited high catalytic efficiency in this reaction, which combined with some other salient features of structural fine tunability, chemical stability, and ready accessibility might endow more practical applications in asymmetric catalytic reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500006

Here, we describe a variation of the nucleotidylation reaction termed "catch and release" that is used by an antibiotic-modifying enzyme. Aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase 4' (ANT4') inactivates antibiotics such as kanamycin and neomycin through nucleotidylation within an active site that shares significant structural and inferred underlying catalytic similarity with human DNA polymerase beta. Here, we follow the entire nucleotidyl transfer reaction coordinate of ANT4' covalently inactivating neomycin using X-ray crystallography. These studies show that although the underlying reaction mechanism is conserved with polymerases, a short 2.35 angstrom hydrogen bond is initially formed to facilitate tight binding of the aminoglycoside substrate and is subsequently disrupted by the assembly of the catalytically active ternary complex. This enables the release of products post catalysis because of a lower free energy of the product state compared to the starting substrate complex. We propose that this "catch and release" mechanism of antibiotic turnover observed in ANT4' is a variation of nucleotidyl transfer that has been adapted for the inactivation of antibiotics.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500005

Plant glycosyltransferases, which catalyze this glycosylation reaction, play a key step in preparing structure diverse and valuable triterpene glycosides. However, this class of enzymes usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency. To address this problem, triterpene glycosyltransferase UGT74AC1 from Siraitia grosvenorii was chosen and its crystal structure was solved and employed as the molecular basis to implement directed evolution and sequence/structure-based engineering. Several resultant uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs) variants exhibit a 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency for triterpene glycosylation. Especially, one variant exhibited up to 4.17 x 10(4)-fold increase in catalytic efficiency toward mogrol and 1.53 x 10(4)-fold increase to UDP-glucose, respectively. Moreover, the mutants also displayed extended substrate promiscuity compared with wildtype enzyme and conserved regioselectivity. Based on the results of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, it was proposed that the improved enzymatic activity and substrate promiscuity were likely owing to the stable hydrophobic interactions and favorite conformations between the enzyme and substrates. This work has also laid a foundation for the engineering of other plant UGTs for their practical application to the synthesis of valuable triterpene saponins.									12	2	0	0	6	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500013

Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) is a cheap, stable, and soluble solid oxidant, holding promise for organic oxidation reactions. Herein, we report the catalytic PMS activation via carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the selective oxidation of BzOH under mild conditions without other additives. A remarkable promotion of BzH yield with a selectivity over 80% was achieved on modified CNTs, i.e., O-CNTs via the radical oxidation process, and the oxygen functionalities for catalysis were comprehensively investigated by experimental study and theoretical exploration. To understand the different surface oxygen species on CNTs for the activation of PMS, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the adsorption behavior of PMS on various CNTs. The electrophilic oxygen was identified as the electron captor to activate PMS by O-O bond cleavage to form SO5 center dot- and SO4 center dot- radicals. The nucleophilic carbonyl groups can also induce a redox cycle to generate (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- radicals, but phenolic hydroxyl groups impede the radical process with antioxidative functionality. The carbocatalysis-assisted PMS activation may provide a cheap process for the selective oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes or ketones. The insight achieved from this fundamental study may be further applied to other organic syntheses via selective oxidation.									31	1	0	0	6	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500001

Like the homogeneously catalyzed protocol, the reaction is compatible with a variety of functional groups including electron-donating and electron-withdrawing aryl and heteroaryl moieties. Moreover, this protocol allows the installation of allyl groups onto (hetero)arenes, enlarging the scope of the method. The heterogeneous mpg-CN photocatalyst is easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused several times, paving the way for larger-scale industrial applications of this type of photocatalytic bond-forming reactions.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500002

However, the development of such a process has been retarded by the lack of efficient electrocatalysts for highly selective synthesis of ammonia from nitrate electroreduction. In this work, TiO2 nanotubes with rich oxygen vacancies (TiO2-x) are reported to exhibit high Faradaic efficiency (85.0%) and selectivity (87.1%) toward the ammonium synthesis from nitrate electroreduction. N-15 isotope labeling experiments prove that ammonium originates from nitrate reduction. Both the H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and colorimetric methods are performed to quantify ammonia. Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory calculations reveal the function of oxygen vacancy in nitrate electroreduction, that is, the oxygen atom in nitrate fills in oxygen vacancies of TiO2-x to weaken the N-O bonding and restrain the formation of byproducts, resulting in high Faradaic efficiency and ammonium selectivity. This strategy may open a paradigm for the development of rationally designed nanostructures as the electrocatalysts for selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonium.									75	5	0	0	12	0	78			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500003

To enable efficient PEM-WE in acidic media, iridium (Ir)- or ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts are indispensable to drive the thermodynamically and kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, developing Ir/Ru catalysts with high efficiency and long-term durability still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of ultrafine IrRu intermetallic nanoclusters loaded on conductive, acid-stable, amorphous tellurium nanoparticle support (IrRu@Te). Benefiting from the large exposed electrocatalytically active surface of ultrafine IrRu clusters and the strong electronic coupling between IrRu and Te support, the as-obtained IrRu@Te catalysts show good catalytic performance for the OER in strong acidic electrolyte (i.e., 0.5 M H2SO4), requiring overpotentials of only 220 and 303 mV to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) and able to sustain continuous OER electrolysis up to 20 h at 10 mA cm(-2) with minimal degradation. Moreover, IrRu@Te exhibits high specific activity, illustrating intrinsically better performance compared with that of unsupported IrRu and other commercial Ir- and Ru-based catalysts. It also demonstrates unprecedentedly high mass activity of 590 A g(IrRu)(-1) at an overpotential of 270 mV, outperforming most Ir- and Ru-based OER catalysts reported in the literature. Furthermore, IrRu@Te catalysts reveal good OER performance in neutral electrolyte as well, holding great potential to be used for PEM-WE in environmentally friendly conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on oxidized IrRu confirm that the catalyst/support coupling results in a lower energy barrier for the oxygen-oxygen bonding formation, offering a rational explanation to the experimentally observed OER performance.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500008

Kinetic measurements indicated a rapid activation phase, followed by a continuous slow deactivation. A faster deactivation of CO formation (reverse water-gas shift reaction) compared to that of methanol formation results in an increasing selectivity toward MeOH formation with time on stream. The activation of the catalyst is attributed to a rapid initial reduction of the support (formation of O vacancies). Since based on STEM imaging and XRD measurements sintering of Au nanoparticles is negligible, the subsequent deactivation is attributed to the slow buildup of site-blocking adsorbates, specifically surface carbonates, and/or over-reduction of the catalyst. This is supported also by the reversible nature of the deactivation upon recalcination in O-2/N-2. Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) measurements, following the buildup/decay of adsorbed formate and methoxy species by DRIFTS upon changing from a CO2/H-2 to a CO2/D-2 mixture and back under steady-state conditions, indicate that surface formate species are reaction intermediates in the dominant reaction pathway for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, with the calculated rates of formation/decay comparable to the rate of methanol formation. The consequences of these results for the mechanistic understanding of this reaction are discussed.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500009

Moderate heat treatment of nickel(II) hydroxide (<= 700 degrees C) leads to the formation of nickel(II) oxide (nano)particles, which exhibit reduced OER activity the higher the heat treatment temperature was. In this work, we report that heat treatment of nickel(II) hydroxide in air at even higher temperatures (60 min at 900 degrees C) results in an oxide material with high OER activity superior to that of the nickel(II) hydroxide. Similarly, the stability of the nickel(II) oxide under electrochemical conditions is increased compared to nickel(II) hydroxide. Electrochemical in situ Raman measurements show the formation of surface nickel oxy-hydroxides (NiOOH) at positive potentials and are significantly affected by the initial heat treatment. From XPS, Raman, and XRD results, it is concluded that a Ni3+-enriched phase, possibly a higher-valent mixed nickel oxide, is present at the surface of the nickel(II) oxide sample treated at 900 degrees C resulting in an increased OER activity compared to NiOOH. This basic understanding of high-temperature-treated nickel oxide may contribute to resolving the present stability issues of OER electrocatalysts and may help to leverage alkaline electrolysis as important key technology for a renewable energy supply.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500010

The state-of-the-art ASC has a dual-layer architecture composed of a Pt/Al2O3 (PGM) bottom layer and a metal (Fe, Cu)-exchanged zeolite (M-Z) top layer. The PGM layer provides high NH3 oxidation activity; however, the desired N-2 product is achieved over a narrow temperature range just above light-off, whereas the reaction byproducts N2O and NOx (i.e., NO and NO2) appear at intermediate and high temperatures, respectively. An advantage of the M-Z catalyst is the selective lean reduction of NO via conversion of NH3 to N-2 over a broad temperature range. Although recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-layer design, further advances are needed to reduce the PGM loading and ASC volume while enhancing low-temperature activity. In this study, the dual-layer concept is scaled down to the level of a single core-shell (CS) catalyst particle, Pt/Al2O3@Cu/ZSM-5, composed of a PGM core and a M-Z shell, with the intent to meet the aforementioned challenges. The CS catalyst was realized by rational design of key synthesis steps, the most critical being the initial growth of an intermediate silicalite-1 layer to prevent Al leaching during the secondary growth of the ZSM-5 shell. Characterization of the CS spherical catalyst reveals a mesoporous PGM core (ca. 40 mu m diameter) that is active and a nearly dense zeolitic shell (ca. 1 mu m thick). Evaluation of the CS catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor shows excellent NH3 oxidation activity and N-2 selectivity. In addition, we obtained an unanticipated enhancement of the Pt/Al2O3 performance within the CS configuration that gives an exceptional light-off of the NH3 oxidation. Our findings reveal that the CS catalyst has an equivalent activity to that of a conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3 times higher Pt loading. Further, a dual-layer ASC composed of a bottom layer containing the seeded core Pt/Al2O3 and a Cu-SSZ-13 top layer achieves the same performance as a dual-layer ASC having 3 times higher Pt loading but with unmodified Pt/Al2O3. The enhanced activity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is attributed to a modification of the reducibility of oxides of Pt crystallites owing to the overgrowth of silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 layers in the CS configuration. Finally, the separate impacts of H2O in the feed and of hydrothermal aging (HTA) on catalyst performance are reported. H2O in the feed is shown to have a negligible impact on conversion and product distribution. The silicalite-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is more resilient to HTA treatment than conventional Pt/Al2O3.									10	1	1	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500011

First row transition metal phosphides recently emerged as excellent alternatives for hydrogen evolution and hydrotreating reactions. We demonstrate that a key member of this family, Ni2P, readily hydrogenates nitrate (NO3-) to ammonia (NH3) near ambient conditions with very high selectivity (96%). One of the few non-precious metal-based catalysts for this transformation, and among ca. 1% of catalysts with NH3 selectivity, Ni2P can be recycled multiple times with limited loss of activity. Both nitrite (NO2-) and nitric oxide (NO) intermediates are also hydrogenated. Density functional theory (DFT) indicates that.in the absence of a catalyst.nitrite hydrogenation is the reaction bottleneck. A variety of adsorbates (H, O, N, NO) induce surface reconstruction with top-layer Ni-rich surface stoichiometry. Critically, H saturation coverage on Ni2P(001) is only ca. 3 nm(-2), significantly less than that on Pd(111) and Ni(111) of ca. 15-18 nm(-2), which may play a key role in allowing coadsorption of NOx-. The ability of Earth-abundant, binary metal phosphides such as Ni2P to catalyze nitrate hydrogenation could transform and help us to better understand the basic science behind catalytic hydrogenation and, in turn, advance the next generation of oxyanion removal technologies.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500012

High reaction temperatures are always needed for heterogeneous catalysis using non-noble metals, and switching product selectivity in one catalysis system remains a great challenge. In the present study, a visible-light-driven procedure for this reaction is proposed, using oxidized TiN photocatalysts under mild conditions, whereby the product selectivity can be well-tuned. Oxidized TiN photocatalysts with tunable surface N/O ratios were successfully synthesized through the facile and flexible thermal oxidation treatment of low-cost TiN nanopowder. The alpha-alkylation of acetophenone with benzyl alcohol to form the two important compounds chalcone and dihydrochalcone occurred even at room temperature and almost complete conversion was achieved at 100 degrees C under visible light. The proportion of the two products can be well-tuned by switching the surface N/O ratio of the synthesized photocatalysts. Visible light is demonstrated to affect the surface N/O ratio of the photocatalysts and contribute to tuning the product selectivity. Light intensity and action spectrum study proves that the generation of energetic charge carriers results in the observed activities under visible light, based on interband transitions of TiN or the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect of the surface complex formed on TiO2. Thermal energy can be coupled with light energy within this photocatalytic system, which will facilitate the full use of solar energy. Different sequential reaction mechanisms on TiN and TiO2 are proposed to be responsible for the tunable product selectivity. The wide reaction scope, the fine conversion at a low light intensity, and the favorable reusability of photocatalysts prove the great application potential of this visible-light-driven procedure for the alpha-alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500014

It is still disputed whether the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) may be competitive with the conventional adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) of the OER in these materials and, if so, under what conditions. Herein, we employ density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that the LOM can give rise to higher OER activity than the AEM at the active sites involving structural defects, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Specifically, we show that, although the AEM is preferred for the perfect (110) and (211) surfaces, the formation of metal vacancies due to catalyst dissolution may lead to much lower OER overpotentials for the LOM. Also, by screening several metal impurities in RuO2, we reveal that dopants such as Ni and Co can promote the LOM over the AEM even for the perfectly structured surfaces. Overall, we demonstrate that defective IrO2 is less LOM active than RuO2 that should contribute to its superior stability under OER conditions.									59	2	0	0	3	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500015

The high overpotential, stability, and selectivity in the use of a single-metal-based catalyst still remain a challenge. In current work, instead of using pure noble metals (Ag, Au, and Pt) as the catalyst, a nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy (HEA: AuAgPtPdCu) has been used for the conversion of CO2 into gaseous hydrocarbons. Utilizing an approach of multimetallic HEA, a faradic efficiency of about 100% toward gaseous products is obtained at a low applied potential (-0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). The reason behind the catalytic activity and selectivity of the high-entropy alloy (HEA) toward CO2 electroreduction was established through first-principles-based density functional theory (DFT) by comparing it with the pristine Cu(111) surface. This is attributed to the reversal in adsorption trends for two out of the total eight intermediates-*OCH3 and *O on Cu(111) and HEA surfaces.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500016

It proceeds under mild reaction conditions in a step-economy process by simultaneously cleaving the C C bonds and constructing C-C bonds. Depending on the substitution of the ynones, the reactions can proceed efficiently to generate synthetically useful 1,4-ketoaldehydes and cyclopentenone compounds. A plausible pathway is proposed that involves an active cyclopropane intermediate that consequently undergoes a cascade ring-opening reaction. The method works for a spectrum of ynones and N-tosylhydrazones that give good to excellent yields using a cheap copper catalytic system.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500017

A variety of reactive functional groups are tolerated in the pyridine 3-position, and sufficient catalytic activity was obtained for reduction of sterically hindered cases such as 3,5-disubstituted pyridines and even 4-substituted pyridines. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the superior catalytic activity and 1,4-regioselectivity of the Cu/Fe heterobinuclear catalyst, compared to the corresponding mononuclear Cu catalyst, is derived from biphilic cooperativity of two key catalytic intermediates: electrophilic CpFe(CO)(2)(Bpin) activates the pyridine substrates toward regioselective nucleophilic addition by (IPr)CuH.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500018

The hydrolysis of these substrates is studied by comparing stepwise, concerted, and substrate-assisted mechanisms. Both the stepwise and concerted mechanisms occur with similar barriers, while the energetics for the substrate-assisted mechanism are significantly less favorable. Irrespective of the mechanism, active site residue His217 plays a critical role, in agreement with structural, kinetics, and spectroscopic data, but the transition state of the reaction depends on the identity of the substrate (dissociative for the triester paraoxon, associative for the monoester 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP), and in-between for the diesters glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine (GPE) and bis(4-nitrophenyl)phosphate (BNPP)). In good agreement with available kinetic and spectrophotometric data, the calculations highlight the preference of GpdQ for diester substrates, followed by tri- and monoesters. For substrates with two different types of scissile bonds (paraoxon and GPE) a clear preference for the bond with the stronger electron withdrawing leaving group was observed. The extensive agreement between experimental data and DFT calculations enhances the understanding of the mechanism of GpdQ-catalyzed hydrolysis and paves the way for the rational design of optimized catalysts for the hydrolysis of different types of phosphoesters.									5	0	1	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500020

However, the photocatalytic H2O2 generation activity of the pristine C3N4 in pure H2O is poor due to unpropitious rapid charge recombination and unfavorable selectivity. Herein, we report a facile method to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 production by grafting cationic polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules onto C3N4. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate PEI can tune the local electronic environment of C3N4. The unique intermolecular electronic interaction in PEI/C3N4 not only improves the electron-hole separation but also promotes the two-electron O-2 reduction to H2O2 via the sequential two-step single-electron reduction route. With the synergy of improved charge separation and high selectivity of two-electron O-2 reduction, PEI/C3N4 exhibits an unexpectedly high H2O2 generation activity of 208.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 25-fold higher than that of pristine C3N4. This study establishes a paradigm of tuning the electronic property of C3N4 via functional molecules for boosted photocatalysis activity and selectivity.									52	2	0	0	3	0	53			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500021

The oxygen mobility in the perovskites described by the formation energy of oxygen vacancy is found to have a pronounced effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity. In particular, the selectivity is controlled largely by the surface oxygen concentration or the oxygen vacancy concentration on perovskites, which depends strongly on the bulk oxygen concentration and the relative rate of the lattice oxygen diffusion with respect to the surface reaction. The substitution of Sr for La at the A site and the substitution of Co for Fe at the B site of the ABO(3) perovskites dramatically increase the oxygen mobility. A higher oxygen diffusion rate, and hence enrichment of oxygen on the surface, would improve the catalyst selectivity toward total oxidation.									26	2	0	0	2	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500022

Herein, a series of Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) containing various types of metal node to ligand coordinations were synthesized and tested for CTH of furfural (FUR) to furfuryl alcohol (FOL). It was found that metal node coordination plays a more important role than porosity in Zr-MOFs. MOF-808 (synthesized using a scaled-up approach to achieve a higher batch yield), with the lowest metal node to ligand coordination (coordination number 6), was found to be the most active catalyst among the various tested Zr-MOFs. Furthermore, M-MOF-808, modified by simple methanol activation (M), outperformed the pristine MOF-808 in CTH of FUR to FOL even at 30 degrees C in the presence of 2-propanol (IPA) as the hydrogen source. The simple modification of the metal node in the Zr-MOF changed the acid-base properties of the MOF-808 surface through the development of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS), hydroxyl and methoxy groups in the framework of the Zr-MOF, which probably help to facilitate the adsorption of FUR and IPA onto the metal node surfaces of the catalyst. To evaluate the versatility of methanol activation in CTH, further substrates, including other types of biomass and representative carbonyl compounds over M-MOF-808, were tested. To demonstrate heterogeneous catalysis, the catalyst was recycled for five consecutive cycles, with little loss after the first cycle, and was fully characterized to observe any changes in its structure. Mechanistic insights were provided by isotopically labeled 2-propanol-d(8) experiments, indicating FUR reduction through transfer hydrogenation. Finally, the reaction mechanism for CTH of FUR to FOL was proposed in detail using density functional theory (DFT) calculations over metal node modified model systems of a 6-connected Zr-MOF.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500023

However, it remains a challenge to effectively regulate the selectivity toward single ethylene or propylene due to the limited catalyst selection and insufficient understanding of the selectivity control principle. Herein, we report the synthesis of a small-pore SAPO-14 molecular sieve (AFN topology) with an ultra-small cage structure and a narrow 8-membered ring (8-MR) channel system, over which the propylene selectivity can rise to as high as 77.3%, representing the highest record of one-pass propylene selectivity in the MTO reaction. The influence of reaction conditions on the catalytic performance was investigated, and the olefin formation mechanism was revealed by combining the analyses of C-12/C-13-methanol isotopic switch experiments, confined organics analysis, and reaction-diffusion simulations. This work provides a possibility to subtly control the MTO product distribution by the design and synthesis of the molecular sieve catalyst.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500025

ACS CATALYSIS				10	6			3750	3763		10.1021/acscatal.0c00399				MAR 20 2020	2020	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of catalyst materials that present the opportunity to develop Lewis acid catalysts with uniform, well-defined, tunable, isolated active sites for a range of chemical transformations. A common example of such a transformation is the acetalization of carbonylic compounds with alcohols over MIL-100. Despite numerous reports focused on the acetalization performance of MIL-100 and related MOF materials, the identity of MIL-100 active sites still remains a point of contention. We present herein a range of catalytic, in situ titration and spectroscopy data that can all plausibly be interpreted under the assumption of the near-exclusive contribution of Bronsted acid sites toward effecting acetalization turnovers over MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-100(Fe). Thermal treatment protocols that simultaneously increase Lewis acid site density and decrease Bronsted acid site density can be used to eliminate more than 90% of MIL-100 mediated turnovers, and infrared spectroscopic signatures indicating the coordination of pyridine to acid sites upon sequential introduction of 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DTBP) followed by pyridine, but not vice versa, are consistent with an attribution of the genesis of Bronsted acid sites to water ligation to open-metal sites. Correlations between MIL-100 degree of hydration, Bronsted acid site density, and net turnover numbers suggest that the involvement of Lewis acid sites, if any, remain minor under the experimental conditions used in this study. Lastly, a decreasing fraction of sites left unititrated by DTBP with lightening diffusion restrictions around the oxo centered trimer indicate that untitrated sites reflect limited access of sterically hindered DTBP, rather than contributions from Lewis acid sites. The principles and methodology used in this study are broadly applicable within the domain of MOF-mediated catalysis, and reinforce the need for a careful evaluation of active site speciation under reaction conditions to more fully realize the promise of MOF materials as Lewis acid catalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500026

Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 9238). Direct calculations of redox potentials (E-0), acidity constants (pK(a)), and free energies of activation (Delta G(double dagger)) by density functional theory (DFT) with the help of high-level ab initio calculations predict that hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) thermodynamically and kinetically favors a Re-hydride/monothiol intermediate, while the hydrogen evolving reaction (HER) favors Re-dihydride intermediates, in contrast to the Re-dithiols as proposed previously. The catalytic pathway for HOR involves two oxidation steps from [ReL3] to [ReL3](2+), followed by H-2 addition to form the Re-hydride/thiol, [(ReH)(S1H)L-2](2+). Under basic conditions, deprotonation of this complex produces [Re(S1H)L-2](+) with the thiol as S1, rather than the proposed S3. Further deprotonation of [Re(S1H)L-2](+) closes the catalytic cycle to regenerate [ReL3]. For the HER, DFT calculations predict that [ReL3] is reduced to [ReL3](-), followed by protonation of [ReL3](-) at the Re center to produce metal-protonated [(ReH)L-3] in accordance with the E-0 = -1.45/-1.60 V (cal./exp.). The E-0 calculations suggest a reassignment of the experimentally observed peak at -1.70 V to the singly protonated E([ReL3 center dot H](0/-)) rather than the doubly protonated E([ReL3 center dot H-2](+/0)). This reassignment and the low relative pK(a)'s of [ReL3 center dot H-2](+) illustrate that addition of the second proton must follow the second electrochemical reduction of [(ReH)L-3] to [(ReH)L-3](-), which is basic enough to be protonated at the Re center making the formation of the Re-dihydride [(HReH)L-3]. Production of H-2 occurs via reductive elimination through a Re-H-2 adduct. The nature of the key intermediates from the DFT calculations is confirmed by the complete active space calculations (CASSCF). This comprehensive investigation into the HOR and HER mechanisms can guide further experimental and theoretical efforts on rationally designing the effective electrocatalysts by comparing how various ligand modifications may shift the mechanistic steps.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500029

However, the interaction role between two active species and reaction paths are still unclear. We report here that a high yield of aromatics was achieved by serial reactions directly from syngas on a Na-Fe-ZrO2/ZSM-5 tandem catalyst. Results point out significant impacts of zeolite in the catalytic system on performance including activity and selectivity. The role of the zeolite on reaction pathways about both CO conversion and aromatic formation has been systematically investigated by steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis and designed experiments. The presence of zeolite in the catalytic system promotes the CO hydrogenation rate by means of improving the iron carburization degree, possibly because of the enhanced CO adsorption and the formation of surface intermediates. It also enhances selectivity to aromatics by coupling CO to participate in the olefin transformation on ZSM-5. In addition, the formation rate of aromatics is proportional to the number of Lewis acidic sites, suggesting the dehydroaromatization route as the main mechanism of olefin aromatization. These findings provide some insights into the effect of ZSM-5 on reaction paths over the FTS catalyst-zeolite tandem catalyst system.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500031

The CAZy classification further assigns these enzymes into sequence-based families sharing a common stereochemistry for substrates (either alpha- or beta-) and products (i.e., inverting or retaining mechanism). Here we describe the N-acetylgalactosaminidases AmGH109A and AmGH109B (i.e., GH109: glycoside hydrolase family 109) from the human gut symbiont Akkermansia muciniphila. Notably, AmGH109A displays alpha-retaining and beta-inverting N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities with comparable efficiencies on natural disaccharides. This dual specificity could provide an advantage in targeting a broader range of host-derived glycans. We rationalize this discovery through bioinformatics, structural, mutational, and computational studies, unveiling a histidine residing in a conserved GGHGG motif as the elusive catalytic acid-base of the GH109 family.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500033

Our computational mechanistic investigations revealed that branched and linear hydroboration products are formed via mechanisms that involve the migratory insertions of styrene into Rh-H and Rh-B bonds, respectively. Such reaction mechanisms are fundamentally different from those calculated for hydroborations catalyzed by Rh-phosphine complexes in which the styrene prefers to insert into the Rh-H bond regardless if the linear or branched product is formed. The calculated steric and electronic effects exhibited by the NHC ligands on the corresponding reaction rates and regioselective outcomes revealed that stronger electron-donor ligands promote reactivity, and the steric bulk of the NHC ligands effectively controll the regioselectivity of the hydroboration reaction. Generally, bulkier NHC ligands favor the formation of linear products and less sterically demanding NHC ligands favor the formation of branched products.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500034

A variety of pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles were constructed by a simple, green, and mild path.

However, the commonly used Pt/carbon nanotubes (Pt/CNT) catalysts suffer from the severe deactivation, because of the strong adsorption of glyceric acid (GLYA), resulting in the serious Pt-surface poisoning and their consequent poor activity with low selectivity toward GLYA. Here, we demonstrate that integrating CeO2 with Pt/CNT could effectively alleviate the catalyst deactivation, delivering high activity and selectivity to produce GLYA. The valence band analysis and kinetic experiments suggest that the Pt-CeO2/CNT ternary interface would weaken the GLYA adsorption on Pt and lower the energy barrier for glycerol oxidation. Moreover, via the generated OH* from H2O dissociation, CeO2 can promote the oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups of glycerol, leading to a high selectivity of GLYA.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500036

Addition of [(NBu4)-Bu-n][OH] immediately terminates metathesis via HII, an effect traced to formation of bis(hydroxide) complex HII-OH. The latter was synthesized for direct study. HII-OH initiates very slowly on reaction with olefins, and decomposes in the first cycle of metathesis. Computational analysis reveals rapid bimolecular coupling between HII-OH and its four-coordinate methylidene derivative. Importantly, fully decomposed catalyst also accelerates decomposition of HII-OH. The H-bonding capacity of the hydroxide ligand is proposed as a powerful driving force for degradation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500037

In particular, formate dehydrogenases are of great interest since they reduce CO2 to formate, a valuable chemical fuel and hydrogen storage compound. The metal-dependent formate dehydrogenases of prokaryotes can show high activity for CO2 reduction. Here, we report an expression system to produce recombinant W/Sec-FdhAB from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hilden-borough fully loaded with cofactors, its catalytic characterization and crystal structures in oxidized and reduced states. The enzyme has very high activity for CO2 reduction and displays remarkable oxygen stability. The crystal structure of the formate-reduced enzyme shows Sec still coordinating the tungsten, supporting a mechanism of stable metal coordination during catalysis. Comparison of the oxidized and reduced structures shows significant changes close to the active site. The DvFdhAB is an excellent model for studying catalytic CO2 reduction and probing the mechanism of this conversion.									11	1	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500038

It can be found that S doping could stabilize the reductive-state Cu as the active site for CO2R. The vibration models of CO2- intermediates within in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that the selectivity improvement is ascribed to the change of the adsorption state from coexisting O*CO- and OC*O*(-) to the dominating OC*O*(-).

The state-of-art synthesis of imines via condensation of amines with aldehydes or ketones often uses homogeneous catalysts and dehydrating agents to promote the elimination of water, which requires huge manpower input for the late-stage purification process and is usually environmentally unfriendly. Photocatalytic synthesis of imines from amines oxidation via the release of hydrogen (H-2) is of great promise due to the mild reaction characteristics; however, the efficiency of such a reaction lags due to the missing designed photocatalyst owing to the ambiguous reaction mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that by constructing in situ photoimmobilized Ni clusters on the CdS photocatalyst, the generation of imines is dramatically improved with the rapid release of molecular H-2 under visible light illumination. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the adsorption of photogenerated hydrogen atoms during the dehydrogenation of amines is significantly weakened on Ni clusters, thus resulting in fast C-N coupling kinetics for the generation of imines. The photocatalyst presents stable performance with high efficiency. A remarkably apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of similar to 44% is realized under 420 nm irradiation for the conversion of 4-methoxybenzylamine within six consecutive runs. Furthermore, a series of primary and secondary amines bearing different functional groups (i.e., heterocyclic, aliphatic, N-heterocycles) that are synthetically challenging by the condensation process can be selectively converted to the corresponding imines, featuring its application prospect.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500045

However, current numerical methods consider individual and often geometrical closed-shell nanoparticles, neglecting how the coexistence of several and structurally diverse isomers in a sample affect the activity of the latter. Here, we present a multiscale numerical approach to calculate, in a fast and high-throughput fashion, the current density and mass activity of individual isomers, as well as predict the activity of morphologically diverse but size-selected samples. We propose specific design rules of platinum nanosamples for the electrochemical reduction of molecular oxygen, identifying the size range up to 5.5 nm as the one where isomerization of individual nanoparticles and the morphological composition of the sample cannot be neglected. We confirm a peak of the activity of defected and concave polyhedra at 2-3 nm while spherical but amorphous isomers become the most active in the range of 3-5 nm, with an astonishing mass activity of 2.7 A/mg.

Up to now, the catalysts for this purpose are largely developed based on trial and error. In this work, we demonstrate that a careful analysis of the formic acid dehydrogenation mechanism can shed light on rational design and facile synthesis of efficient Pd-based catalysts, that is, carbon black-supported fine Pd nanoparticles with adatoms of an sp metal (including but not limited to Bi). In fact, Pd@Bi/C with an optimal atomic ratio doubles the Pd mass activity of the Pd/C in terms of hydrogen production rate, specifically with a global turnover frequency of 4350 h(-1) at 303 K in a mixed 1.1 M formic acid and 2.4 M sodium formate solution without engineering the catalyst support. Apparent kinetic measurement, in situ interfacial IR spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation results further confirm that Bi adatoms favor the adsorption of the formate intermediate to facilitate the C-H bond cleavage and weaken the adsorption of H and CO on Pd sites, resulting in a prominently enhanced H-2 production performance.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500047

In situ quick extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy showed that Pd remains stable and nonreducible in the flowing ethanol/water solvent mixture under heating to 353 K. However, ex situ transmission electron microscopy, high-energy X-ray diffraction, and fluorescence yield Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure show that the addition of a significant amount of base (K2CO3, 0.1 M) results in the structural degradation of the perovskite support as well as the mobilization of Pd along the sample bed that is dependent on the structure and crystallite size of the perovskite. The results are discussed in terms of the use of perovskite-type oxides in various areas of research where they are placed in contact with liquid phases of variable temperature and elevated pH.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500048

The modifiers typically stereodirect prochiral reactants on the metal surface through the formation of diastereomeric complexes. Surface science measurements on model systems show several examples where such complexes display multiple abundant binding configurations. Insights into the factors determining the relative populations of complexation states can be potentially gained from comparing slightly variant chiral modifiers. Here, we compare scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for chirality transfer complexes formed by (R)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine and (R)-1-(8-methyl-1-naphthyl)ethylamine coadsorbed with the prochiral substrate 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone in order to probe for changes induced by the methyl substituent. The comparison shows changes in relative abundances beyond those predicted by only direct steric interaction. Density functional theory (DFT) methods are used to calculate complexation energies. A number of rationalizations are proposed for the experimentally determined differences in relative abundances and also for differences between DFT-predicted and STM-measured populations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300015

The exact role of the catalytic resting state of the homo-biaryl-Pd(II) complex, which was previously overlooked in Pd/Ag dual-catalyzed CDC, was carefully investigated. Detailed experimental studies indicated that a homo-biaryl-Pd(II) complex occurred in the catalytic off-cycle as a resting state and prevented the homocoupling of perfluoroarenes. In addition, these studies indicated that the C-H bond activation steps of perfluoroarenes and thiophenes proceeded by different mechanisms. While the C-H bond of perfluoroarenes was immediately activated by Ag(I) salts, the C-H bond of thiophenes was activated by the Pd(II) catalyst. Kinetic studies revealed that the Pd(II)-C-H activation of thiophenes is most likely the rate-determining step.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300050

These catalysts are also active for the reverse reaction, i.e., the decomposition of formic acid to H-2 and CO2. While numerous catalysts have been synthesized for reactions in both directions, the factors controlling the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle remain poorly understood. In this work, we synthesize a series of compounds of type H4Ru(P(C6H4R)(3))(3) containing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups and analyze their influence on the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of CO2 insertion and deinsertion. The data are correlated with the catalytic performance of the complexes through linear free-energy relationships. The results show that formic acid dissociation from the catalyst is rate-determining during CO2 hydrogenation, while deinsertion is critical for the decomposition reaction.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300010

Although the borylation of aryl C-H bonds can be catalyzed by iridium complexes containing phen or bpy ligands at mild temperatures and with limiting arene, the borylation of alkyl C-H bonds remains underdeveloped. We prepared a library of phenanthrolines that contain varying substitution patterns. The corresponding phen-Ir trisboryl carbon monoxide complexes were synthesized to determine the electron-donating ability of these ligands, and the initial rates for the borylation of the C-H bonds in THE and diethoxyethane beta to oxygen catalyzed by Ir complexes containing these ligands were measured. For some subsets of these ligands, the donor ability correlated positively with the rate of C-H borylation catalyzed by the complexes containing ligands within a given subset. However, across subsets, ligands possessing similar donor properties to one another form catalysts for the borylation of alkyl C-H bonds with widely varying activity. This phenomenon was investigated computationally, and it was discovered that the stabilizing interactions between the phenanthroline ligand and the boryl ligands attached to Ir in the transition state for C-H oxidative addition could account for the differences in the activity of the catalysts that possess similar electron densities at Ir. The effect of these interactions on the borylation of secondary alkyl C-H bonds is larger than it is on the borylation of primary alkyl C-H bonds.									18	1	1	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300053	33178481

Here, we report a successful protocol toward addressing this issue via an organocatalyzed cascade annulation. The protocol could afford 11 classes of enantioenriched alpha-functionalized ketones using a single catalytic system and avoid the frequent alterations of reaction conditions used in conventional methods. Up to 684 of the selectivity factor (s) is observed, and in most case, the s values are higher than 100. An aminolactam additive proves essential in promoting the resolution efficiency. Moreover, many previously unavailable enantiopure alpha-functionalized ketones are now accessible, and the annulation products are also useful building blocks and can be further transferred to densely substituted ketones without erosion of the optical purity. Mechanistically, in sharp contrast to the currently used direct one-step resolution patterns, a two-key-step resolution mode, wherein the enantiomer discrimination happens at the second aldol step and the enatioenriched ketones are recovered by the reversible initial Michael reaction, is proposed, which provides opportunities addressing the challenging tasks that could not be solved by conventional resolution techniques.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300001

Given their importance, methods that directly functionalize aza-cycles are in high demand. Herein, we disclose a fundamentally different approach to functionalizing cyclic amines which relies on C-C cleavage and attendant cross-coupling. The initial functionalization step is the generation of underexplored N-fused bicyclo alpha-hydroxy-beta-lactams under mild, visible light conditions using a Norrish-Yang process to affect alpha-functionalization of saturated cyclic amines. This approach is complementary to previous methods for the C-H functionalization of aza-cycles and provides unique access to various cross-coupling adducts. In the course of these studies, we have also uncovered an orthogonal, base-promoted opening of the N-fused bicyclo alpha-hydroxy-beta-lactams. Computational studies have provided insight into the origin of the complementary C-C cleavage processes.									26	0	0	0	10	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300005	33569242

Upon introduction to the environment, it is a pervasive groundwater pollutant that poses remediation challenges. There remain few homogeneous systems capable of deoxygenating perchlorate to chloride, and the reported catalysts suffer from deactivation as the concentration of chloride increases during catalysis. This report improves the turnover number of perchlorate reduction by an iron catalyst containing a secondary coordination sphere by an order of magnitude. The use of a zinc reagent mitigates chloride inhibition and promotes catalyst turnover. Additionally, the initial rate of perchlorate reduction was examined using time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy, furnishing insights into the mechanism of perchlorate reduction.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300029

Here, we show the unique, interlattice growth of the small molecule activating Ag-0 guest within the Lewis acidic/basic Fe3O4 octahedral host (Fe3O4@Ag-40, 10, 6, 2 at %) via a polyol-hydrothermal procedure. Microscopic (scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and structural characterization (powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) of the Fe3O4@Ag hybrid materials reveal doping of Ag-0 in Oh Fe2+ substitutional vacancies of the Fe3O4 host and Ag-0 nanoparticle growth on and embedded deep within (>400 nm, Ar+ sputtering) the octahedra. These hybrid materials activate CO2 and perform C(sp)-H and C(sp(3))-Cl bond scission of alkyne substrates to selectively produce lactone heterocycles in up to 85% yield. Control reactions delineate two distinct pathways for the mechanism involving the complementarity of interfacial sites where alkyne activation occurs at Fe-O sies and CO2 incorporation is predominately managed by Ag-0. The recyclability of the Fe3O4@Ag-40B hybrid catalyst is demonstrated over five cycles and it shows the structural integrity of the octahedra, but a gradual drop in yield of the product from 85 to 45% due to slow depletion of surface Ag NPs is observed. Together, these results illustrate a rare understanding of the cooperative synergy and mechanism of multimetallic nanocatalyst interfaces for multiple substrate reactivity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300045

The reaction, which utilizes [Ir(cod)Cl](2) and a commercially available chiral xyliphos ligand, proceeds in good yield with high levels of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity (up to 95% ee and >20:1 dr) on a range of differentially substituted isoquinolines. Directing-group studies demonstrate that the hydroxymethyl functional group at the C1 position is more efficient at enabling hydrogenation in comparison to other substituents, although high levels of enantioselectivity were conserved across a variety of polar and nonpolar functional groups. By utilization of the generated chiral beta-amino alcohol as a functional handle, the synthetic utility is further highlighted via the synthesis of 1,2-fused oxazolidine, oxazolidinone, and morpholinone tetrahydroisoquinolines in one step.

This atom economical reaction, which proceeds under operationally simple conditions, is compatible with a wide variety of dienes and provides a straightforward method to assemble different types of saturated lactams. The annulation is favored over alternative pathways in part because of the key role of the extra double bond of the diene partner.

The chelate coordination of the amido group to rhodium and the nonbonding interactions between the substrate and the ligand play important roles to afford chiral alpha-amidoboronic esters with quantitative conversions, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (92-99% ee). Computation of the catalytic cycle revealed selectivity both in the hydrogen activation and migratory insertion steps, equally contributing to the high enantioselectivity. In both cases, the nonbonding interactions provided by the Bpin group contributed significantly to the stabilization of the transition states in the lower energy pathway.									11	2	1	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300035

However, the inherent complexity of the lignin structure and the multiple pathways in lignin hydrogenolysis make gaining insight into the lignin hydrogenolysis mechanism even more challenging. In this report, a beta-O-4 polymer with deuterium incorporated at the alpha, beta, and gamma positions which can better model the plant lignin structure was prepared for mechanistic study. The location and retention of deuterium in the monomers resulting from the hydrogenolysis and transfer hydrogenolysis of the deuterated beta-O-4 mimics with Ru/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Zn/C in MeOH indicated that the beta-O-4 linkage protons did not participate in the cleavage process, which indicated that pathways involving dehydrogenation and/or dehydration reactions are infeasible for these catalysts under these conditions. A concerted process, wherein the C-a-O and C-beta-O bonds in beta-O-4 structures were cleaved concurrently, was proposed as a potential hydrogenolysis mechanism in the Pd/C and Ru/C systems. Dehydroxylation at the alpha position was identified as a side reaction in the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of dimer models, from which the same concurrent cleavage mechanism was also inferred. The introduction of a Lewis acid center in Pd/C was conducive to beta-O-4 hydrogenolysis, as confirmed by the abatement of the side reaction and the enhanced monomer yield in the polymeric model reactions. The use of deuterium-incorporated beta-O-4 mimics paved the way for clearly elucidating the lignin hydrogenolysis mechanism.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200048

The ee values for diastereomeric salts can exhibit significant differences (avg/high/median Delta(%ee) = 10/63/6; matched/mismatched effect), and in a few cases, they are better than those obtained with Lambda- or Delta-(S,S)-1(3+) 2Cl(-)BAr(f)(-). The crystal structure of Delta-(S,S)-1(3+) 2(1S)-camphSO(3)(-)BAr(f)(-) shows that the two sulfonate moieties hydrogen-bond to opposite (idealized) C-3-symmetric faces of the trication, with a separate oxygen atom associated with each of the three synperiplanar NH groups.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300037

However, the poor stability of these enzymes often limits their application in biocatalysis. Here, we used a framework for enzyme stability engineering by computational library design (FRESCO) to stabilize the homodimeric PLP fold type I omega-transaminase from Pseudomonas jessenii. A large number of surface-located point mutations and mutations predicted to stabilize the subunit interface were examined. Experimental screening revealed that 10 surface mutations out of 172 tested were indeed stabilizing (6% success), whereas testing 34 interface mutations gave 19 hits (56% success). Both the extent of stabilization and the spatial distribution of stabilizing mutations showed that the subunit interface was critical for stability. After mutations were combined, 2 very stable variants with 4 and 6 mutations were obtained, which in comparison to wild type (T-m(app) = 62 degrees C) displayed T-m(app) values of 80 and 85 degrees C, respectively. These two variants were also 5-fold more active at their optimum temperatures and tolerated high concentrations of isopropylamine and cosolvents. This allowed conversion of 100 mM acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethylamine (>99% enantiomeric excess) with high yield (92%, in comparison to 24% with the wild-type transaminase). Crystal structures mostly confirmed the expected structural changes and revealed that the most stabilizing mutation, 1154V, featured a rarely described stabilization mechanism: namely, removal of steric strain. The results show that computational interface redesign can be a rapid and powerful strategy for transaminase stabilization.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300004	32953233

Prxs offer a major model of protein-thiol oxidative modification. They react with H2O2 to form a sulfenic acid intermediate that either engages into a disulfide bond, committing the enzyme into its peroxidase cycle, or again reacts with peroxide to produce a sulfinic acid that inactivates the enzyme. Sensitivity to sulfinylation depends on the kinetics of these two competing reactions and is critically influenced by a structural transition from a fully folded (FF) to locally unfolded (LU) conformation. Analysis of the reaction of the Tsal Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prx with H2O2 by Trp fluorescence based rapid kinetics revealed a process linked to the FF/LU transition that is kinetically distinct from disulfide formation and suggested that sulfenate formation facilitates local unfolding. Use of mutants of distinctive sensitivities and of different peroxide substrates showed that sulfinylation sensitivity is not coupled to the resolving step kinetics but depends only on the sulfenic acid oxidation and FF-to-LU transition rate constants. In addition, stabilization of the active site FF conformation, the determinant of sulfinylation kinetics, is only moderately influenced by the Prx C-terminal tail dynamics that determine the FF -> LU kinetics. From these two parameters, the relative sensitivities of Prxs toward hyperoxidation with different substrates can be predicted, as confirmed by in vitro and in vivo patterns of sulfinylation.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300043	32363077

In natural photosynthesis, photosystem I (PSI) exhibits an intrinsic quantum efficiency of nearly 100% in solar energy conversion. The elaborate synergy of electron transfer and electron utilization guarantees the conversion of unstable excited electrons to stable electrons in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). To demonstrate this in vitro, we report a design of core-shell metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as an "electron buffer tank" to coordinate electron transfer and electron utilization in photocatalysis. The electrons are generated via the irradiation on photosensitizers (2-aminoterephthalic acid, NH2-BDC) in the core and then transferred to Zr6O8 clusters on the shell through the light-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer mechanism. Neighboring reaction centers, [Cp*Rh(bpydc)H2O](2+), on the MOFs behave as the electron buffer tank and store these electrons in the form of hydrides for subsequent regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The electron lifetime is prolonged from nanoseconds to seconds, leading to 2.27-fold enhancement of electron availability and 2.08-fold enhancement of activity compared to the homogeneous reaction counterpart. The coupling of NADH regeneration and enzyme catalysis further enables the asymmetric reduction of carbonyl to chiral amine. The electron buffer tank concept may offer a generic strategy to coordinate mass transfer and chemical reaction in a broad range of catalytic processes.									15	1	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300002

Now, we report evidence of the reactivity and the quantitative characterization of the missing linker defects on the Zr12O22 nodes in the MOF hcp UiO-66 (these are paired Zr6O8 nodes bridged by OH groups) and those on the Zr6O8 nodes of the MOF UiO-66. The defect sites catalyze the ring-opening reactions of epoxides with alcohols, and new sites formed by removal of bridging OH groups on the Zr12O22 nodes also participate in the catalysis. The hcp UiO-66 was synthesized from UiO-66 and from molecular precursors, and, under various synthesis conditions, the nodes incorporated acetate ligands, where linkers were missing, and the number of these ligands was controlled by the synthesis conditions. These ligands are inhibitors of the catalytic reactions, and their removal by reaction with, for example, methanol (to form, for example, methyl acetate) preceded catalysis on the defect sites. The former MOF incorporated more defect sites than the latter, correspondingly being a more active catalyst. The defect sites on the Zr12O22 nodes are 2-6 times more active per site than those on the isolated Zr6O8 nodes, with the node-bridging OH groups increasing the catalytic activity of the neighboring node defect sites because new sites are formed by their removal. The results help point the way to the design and control of catalytic sites on metal oxide-like MOF nodes by tuning of the number and reactivity of the defect sites.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300003

Obtained ATR-FTIR data sets were analyzed via multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), which enabled us to clearly differentiate various reaction pathways for different Pt loadings at otherwise fixed reaction conditions (i.e., methanol concentration, UV intensity). At the highest Pt loading (nominal concentration of 2.7 wt %), photo oxidation of methanol occurs via direct oxidation through a formaldehyde intermediate to CO2, whereas the lower Pt loadings of 0.7 and 1.4 wt % favor a side reaction that includes methyl formate as an intermediate. These findings were correlated with the formation of different CO binding sites on Pt during photodeposition, and we presume that changes in the reaction pathway depend on the number rather than the nature of active available Pt sites. Complementary ex situ characterizations of the thin films by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were performed, delivering information on the generated Pt nanoparticles and structural changes of TiO2. The presented optical setup paves the way for fundamental studies of heterogeneous catalytic reactions as close as possible to their actual use in aqueous systems.									7	2	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300008

The kinetic data collected to develop this model includes ethanol, 1-butanol, and water-ethanol feeds at 350 degrees C, 1 bar, and between 3 and 20% conversion over HAP. The model consists of nine kinetic parameters describing 647 reactions among 185 alcohols. Inhibition from byproduct water leads to decreases in reaction rates and alcohol selectivities as conversion increases, which the model can accurately predict at 60% conversion at over 8 times the highest contact time used in model development. The modified step growth kinetics underlying the model also accurately predict alcohol distributions at this conversion. Further extrapolations clarify how these kinetics (modified step growth wherein branched alcohols do not act nucleophilically) in addition to inhibition and side reactions affect the potential use of direct ethanol oligomerization to selectively produce heavy alcohols with HAP. Further deviations from step-growth kinetics can be modeled via manipulation of the apparent nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of ethanol relative to higher alcohols. Catalysts that could increase the nucleophilicity would lead to higher product linearities, while catalysts that decrease the electrophilicity would lead to heavier alcohol distributions at fixed conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300009

Here, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the participation of the ceria support in the redox catalysis. To unravel the structural dynamics of vanadia/ceria (VOx/CeO2) catalysts during ethanol ODH, we have applied a combination of operando multiwavelength Raman and operando UV-vis spectroscopy. Our approach consists of the targeted use of different Raman excitation wavelengths, enabling the selective enhancement of ceria (at 385 nm) and vanadia (at 515 nm) vibrational features. As part of the support dynamics, ceria lattice oxygen is shown to directly participate in the ODH reaction, while V-O-Ce interface bonds are broken during substrate adsorption, resulting in ethoxide formation. The presence of V-O-Ce bonds is considered to be crucial for the observed synergy effect in catalytic performance, allowing ceria to act as an oxygen buffer stabilizing the vanadium center. By providing an experimental basis for a detailed understanding of working VOx/CeO2 catalysts, our results highlight the importance of active support participation in oxide catalysis.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300011

However, tuning the selectivity of a desired product in a controllable manner remains difficult. In this study, we performed MTH reactions on DDR zeolites at 400 degrees C and subcoinplete methanol conversions to investigate how the highly constrained pore structure of a DDR zeolite impacts on the reaction pathways and the product selectivity. We find that the propylene selectivity monotonically increases as the aluminum content and crystallize size of the DDR zeolite decreases. With this understanding, we are able to maximize the propylene selectivity up to 50.6% by modifying the DDR zeolite. We performed isotopic tracing experiments and analysis of residual species in the catalysts to validate the dual-cycle (aromatic- and olefin-based cycle) mechanism in DDR zeolite-catalyzed MTH and demonstrate that propylene is primarily produced from the olefin-based cycle. We attribute the unique behavior of DDR zeolites to that their ultrasmall pore sizes impose restriction on the molecular diffusion of higher olefins, leading to a more important role of the olefin-based catalytic cycle in the reaction, in comparison with other zeolites with larger pores.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300012

Utilizing one-dimensional Pt3Co NWs as the basic catalyst model, here we have successfully demonstrated significant improvements in electrocatalytic durability and activity derived from doping of Ga atoms. The optimized surface energy caused by the doping of Ga atoms drives the resulting catalysts to exhibit good durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis. However, although oxygen binding energy (E-O) would rather deviate from the optimal value because of excessive Ga on the surface, the formation of proper Ga-O bonding can also promote oxygen binding to approach an optimal value, which results in an enhanced ORR activity. It can be therefore concluded that doping of an appropriate amount of Ga atoms has a positive effect in improving the ORR performance of the catalyst, not only in terms of specific activity but also in durability. This interesting phenomenon was also further extended to improve the catalysis of methanol oxidation (MOR) and ethanol oxidation (EOR) reactions, thus reflecting multifunctionalities of lavender-like Ga-doped Pt3Co NWs on fuel cell reactions. This study highlights the great potential of Ga-doped strategies for surface and near-surface regulation, which can effectively address the poor durability of 1D Pt-based NWs for energy catalytic technology.									23	2	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300013

The role of superelectrophilic Ga2Cl6 homodimers has been confirmed and explained. The results are consistent with the observation of second-order rate dependence in GaCl3-mediated Friedel-Crafts alkylations. This work also reveals that, even in a typical Friedel-Crafts alkylation, no Wheland-type sigma-complex can be modeled, suggesting a concerted electrophilic aromatic substitution. Also refuted is the possibility of activation of the arene nucleophile by the Lewis acid.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300014

Copper radical oxidases from Auxiliary Activity Family 5/Subfamily 2 (AA5_2) are attractive biocatalysts because they oxidize primary alcohols in a chemoselective manner without complex organic cofactors. However, despite numerous studies on canonical galactose oxidases (GalOx, EC 1.1.3.9) and engineered variants, and the recent discovery of a Colletotrichum graminicola copper radical alcohol oxidase (AlcOx, EC 1.1.3.13), the catalytic potentials of very few AA5_2 members have been characterized. Guided by the sequence similarity network and phylogenetic analyses, we targeted a distinct paralog from the fungus C. graminicola as a representative member of a large uncharacterized subgroup of AA5_2. Through recombinant production and detailed kinetic analysis, we demonstrated that this enzyme is weakly active toward carbohydrates but efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of aryl alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. As such, this represents the initial characterization of a demonstrable aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO, EC 1.1.3.7) in AAS, an activity which is classically associated with Flavin-dependent glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases of Auxiliary Activity Family 3 (AA3). X-ray crystallography revealed a distinct multidomain architecture comprising an N-terminal PAN domain abutting a canonical AA5 seven-bladed propeller catalytic domain. Of direct relevance to biomass processing, the wild-type enzyme exhibits the highest activity on the primary alcohol of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a product of significant interest in the lignocellulosic biorefinery concept. Thus, the chemoselective oxidation of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) by C. graminicola aryl alcohol oxidase (CgrAAO) from AAS provides a fundamental building block for chemistry via biotechnology.									12	0	0	0	5	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300016

It is shown that the initial steps of this reaction-the active catalyst formation and the C-Cl bond activation-proceed via the "base-assisted oxidative addition" mechanism and require only a 16.2 kcal/mol barrier. The following steps of the reaction are palladacycle and Pd-aryne formations, among which the former is favorable: it proceeds with a moderate C-H activation barrier and is slightly exergonic. Although the Pd-aryne formation requires a slightly lower energy barrier, it is highly endergonic. It is shown that the base plays important roles also in the palladacycle formation and facilitates the driving of the reaction forward by removing a proton to the solution via the bicarbonate-to-carbonate exchange mechanism. Addition of the second C-Cl bond to the thermodynamically favorable palladacycle, i.e., Pd(II)/Pd(IV) oxidation, is a rate-limiting step of the entire Pd-catalyzed and Cs-carbonate-mediated ACD reactions: it occurs with a 35.8 kcal/mol energy barrier and is exergonic by 25.1 kcal/mol. The following polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation is a multistep process and requires a lesser energy barrier. An alternative pathway, namely, cyclooctatetraene (COT) formation, requires a higher energy barrier and is not feasible. This finding is consistent with experiments that show no COT product in the utilized conditions. The calculations also indicate that the observed diminishing of the yield of the Pd-catalyzed ACD reaction upon the use of Na2CO3 instead of Cs2CO3 is the result of not only the poor solubility of Na-carbonate in the used experimental conditions but also a prohibitively large free-energy barrier required for the second C-Cl activation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300017

It enables the production of syngas from CO2 and CH4 reforming. While Ni catalyst presents a high activity regarding this process, it often suffers from deactivation. It was found that the Sn-doped Ni catalyst can avoid carbon deposition, but a decrease in DRM reactivity was also observed. In this work, we used density functional theory calculations in combination with microkinetic modeling first to understand how Sn doping affects the resistance to carbon deposition and the surface catalytic activities of Ni. Based on the understandings, we found that an ideal dopant should give rise to a proper adsorption energy of carbon such that (i) the C* formation process, e.g., CH4 dissociation, is rate-controlling to improve the carbon resistance and (ii) relatively low dissociation barriers of CH4 and CO2 can be achieved to maintain a good activity. Therefore, the adsorption energy of carbon and the dissociation barriers of CH4 and CO2 can be utilized as descriptors for the stability and activity of Ni-based catalysts. Subsequently, we screened several metal dopants and found that the descriptors designed are capable of providing a consistent activity and stability trend with experiments reported in the literature. Therefore, our work could provide relevant guidelines to rationally design efficient catalysts for the DRM reaction.									28	2	0	0	0	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300018

Even for CO oxidation over SACs on nonreducible substrates, the understanding is limited. We investigated the performance of Pd atoms monodispersed on graphene (PdGr) in CO oxidation. Combining first-principles-based thermodynamics calculations and microkinetics modeling, we showed that the positively charged PdGr can exhibit a rather high low-temperature activity in CO oxidation. Under reaction conditions, the Pd atom binds strongly with 02, acting as the reactive species to convert CO. A comparison of the conversion rates of steps along different potential reaction pathways provides direct evidence that CO oxidation mainly proceeds through revised Langmuir-Hinshelwood pathways, and the dissociation of the peroxide intermediate (O-O-C=O) is the rate limiting step. The predicted catalytic performance was attributed to the specific electronic structure of PdGr with the positively charged Pd on graphene monovacancy exposing sp-type frontier states. We expect these findings to help in understanding the performance of SACs and to guide the design and fabrication of SACs with superior catalytic performance.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300019

The engineered mutant alcohol dehydrogenase II binds Zn2+ with high binding affinity and is functional under aerobic and oxidative conditions for a longer time than the wild-type, Fe2+-binding alcohol dehydrogenase II. Overall, the mutant enzyme demonstrated electrochemical activity toward both acetaldehyde reduction and ethanol oxidation reactions.

D-Glucose and glycerol have emerged in recent years as prospective replacements for fossil fuels used in the production of high-value chemicals, and cell-free bioproduction routes are expected to play a crucial role in such processes. Recently, several synthetic cascades used for the cell-free biotransformations of D-glucose and glycerol to pyruvate and beyond have been described. However, these were limited by the very slow dehydration step of D-glycerate to pyruvate catalyzed by a dehydratase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsDHAD), making this step by far the major bottleneck. By combining the vast number of available genomes with a sequence-based discovery approach, we have identified signature sequences leading to the discovery of two distinct classes of dehydratases which exhibit promising activity and total turnover number (TTN) toward D-glycerate. In particular, the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT) demonstrated >100-fold higher activity and TTN for D-glycerate in comparison to SsDHAD. In addition, PuDHT showed exceptionally high activity and TTN toward D-gluconate. The replacement of SsDHAD by PuDHT in our model cascade from D-glucose to ethanol enhanced the production rate 10-fold, reaching a 92% theoretical yield at 50 degrees C. PuDHT was also suitable for the conversion of glycerol to pyruvate at ambient temperature, leading to a >5-fold improvement in production rate in comparison to the system utilizing SsDHAD at 50 degrees C and attaining 97% of the theoretical yield. PuDHT was also compatible when crude glycerol was used as the substrate, and it no longer caused a bottleneck in the enzymatic cascade.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300022

Their Fe site structure was investigated by UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Mossbauer spectroscopy at different temperatures including cryogenic conditions, and their selective catalytic reduction (SCR) activity was studied between 400 and 870 K. Mossbauer analysis was performed by establishing consistent models that well represent cryogenic measurements at low and high magnetic fields (10 mT and 5 T, respectively) but also low-field measurements at higher temperatures, which were performed in order to evaluate their analytical potential. It was found that a reliable analysis in particular of species in small structures (binary, oligomeric sites) requires modeling of cryogenic Mossbauer data with spin-Hamiltonian formalism, which needs to be combined with input from EPR spectroscopy for specifying/confining the type of paramagnetic Fe-III site to be included in the model. Spin-Hamiltonian formalism (combined with input from EPR) can be applied also to measurements at higher temperatures where reliable results for paramagnetic Fe-III and Fe-II sites and for the sum of superparamagnetic Fe-III species and particles can be obtained from spectra measured at 77 K. While qualitative observations in EPR spectra of initial samples were in good agreement with quantitative site abundances obtained from the Mossbauer spectra, there were significant deviations between the latter and results from UV-vis measurements. Mossbauer-derived site distributions in postcatalytic samples (after reaction at 670 K) showed that the standard SCR rate correlates well with the abundance of oligomeric Fe-III oxo sites, in particular with binary Fe-III-O-Fe-III structures, although an intercept may indicate a minor relevance of an additional species. The clear correlation between rates and abundance of Fe-III sites rejects reoxidation as a rate-limiting step for the given catalysts and reaction conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300023

It is, however, a challenging task to synthesize nanostructured catalysts with such defective surfaces. Hence, we present a one-step and upscalable top-down approach to produce a Pt/C catalyst (with similar to 3 nm Pt nanoparticle diameter). Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and tomography, electrochemical techniques, high-energy X-ray measurements, and positron annihilation spectroscopy, we provide evidence of a high density of surface defects (including surface concavities). The ORR activity of the developed catalyst exceeds that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst, at least 2.7 times in terms of specific activity (similar to 1.62 mA/cm(Pt)(2), at 0.9 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) and at least 1.7 times in terms of mass activity (similar to 712 mA/mg(Pt)), which can be correlated to the enhanced amount of surface defects. In addition, the technique used here reduces the complexity of the synthesis (and therefore production costs) in comparison to state of the art bottom-up techniques.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300024

While wild-type (WT) RPA1163 shows high thermostability and fairly wide substrate scope, many interesting yet poorly or moderately accepted substrates exist. In order to solve this problem and to develop upscaled production, in silico calculations and semirational mutagenesis were employed. Residue W185 was engineered to alanine, serine, threonine, or asparagine. The two best mutants, W185N and W185T, showed significantly improved performance in the reactions of these substrates, while in silico calculations shed light on the origin of these improvements. Finally, 10 alpha-fluorocarboxylic acids and 10 alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids were prepared on a gram scale via kinetic resolution enabled by WT, W185T, or WI 85N. This work expands the biocatalytic toolbox and allows a deep insight into the fluoroacetate dehalogenase catalyzed C-F cleavage mechanism.									8	1	0	0	6	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300025

This study unravels structure sensitivity of ultrasmall Ag nanocubes with lengths below 25 and 70 nm (L25- and L70-Ag-NCs) enclosed completely by the (100) facet toward an efficient CO2RR to CO. The ultrasmall L25-Ag-NCs deliver a remarkably larger current density, a significantly higher Faraday efficiency (FE) of near-unity, and a comparably higher energy efficiency of 64.0% as well as a better stability of similar to 18 h as compared to L70-Ag-NCs, Ag nanoparticles, and bulk Ag. More importantly, CO generation initiates at an ultralow overpotential of 146 mV, accompanied with a remarkably high onset CO FE of 59.6%, further demonstrating the excellence of L25-Ag-NCs for highly active and selective CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations, the percentages of various catalytically active sites, and how the architecture of NCs affecting the active sites as well as the partial density of states were analyzed; the results reveal that the essential origins credited for the enhanced catalytic activity and near-unity CO selectivity over L25-Ag-NCs at lowered eta originate from the particular nanostructure, where energetically favorable active sites toward CO2RR are maximally introduced through accurately synthesizing the specific nanostructure enclosed by a certain facet.									37	1	0	0	2	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300027

Insights from CO Oxidation on Au-Supported Ceria Nanoparticles Using Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics								ACS CATALYSIS				10	5			3164	3174		10.1021/acscatal.9b05175				MAR 6 2020	2020	Gold-supported ceria nanoparticles (CeOx/Au), constituting an inverse system with respect to the more commonly studied ceria-supported gold nanoparticles, were previously identified as an excellent catalyst for water-gas shift reaction, CO oxidation, and steam reforming of methanol. However, the electronic structure and reactivity of such inverse catalysts have not been well understood. To probe the inherent nanoparticle-support interactions and their mechanistic role for the catalytic CO oxidation over this composite catalyst, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and static density functional theory computations have been carried out for Au(111)-supported ceria clusters (Ce10O20/19), as a realistic model system of an inverse CeOx/Au catalyst. We have identified the perimeter of the supported ceria nanoparticle as the most favorable O vacancy formation site; however, the vacancy further migrates to an inner interface site during the thermalization process, simultaneously triggering electron transfer from ceria to Au. Our study shows that the Au(111) surface always withdraws electron density from ceria, irrespective of the chemical environment, namely, in a reducing (Ce10O19) as well as oxidizing (Ce10O20) environment. To mimic a realistic catalytic environment, CO and O-2 molecules were preadsorbed on the surface of a composite catalyst. We find a vacancy diffusion-assisted Mars-van Krevelen type of reaction mechanism in which the first CO molecule reacts with a lattice O atom of ceria rather than with an activated O-2(2-) species, forming CO2 and leaving one O vacancy behind. This vacancy becomes subsequently refilled by an O atom diffusing from the site of O-2 reaction with a second CO molecule, recovering the stoichiometry of the Ce10O19 cluster and closing the catalytic cycle. Finally, we discuss differences and similarities between ceria/Au and Au-n/ceria with respect to surface dynamics, charge transfer between the gold and the oxide phases, and the mechanism of CO oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300028

Here, we report on how these factors are interconnected. Combining time-resolved transmission electron microscopy imaging and selected area electron diffraction with online conversion detection, CO oxidation over Pt nanoparticles was studied at a pressure of 700 mbar and temperatures up to 500 degrees C. The different interactions between reactants and catalysts over the entire range of catalytic conversion were investigated. Chemical dynamics in this reaction were found to consist of both morphological transformations and fluctuating structural dynamics. Morphological transformations were observed mostly in low activity regimes, leading to nanoparticles with increased stable surface facets. Meanwhile structural changes were observed during high activity regimes where the partial pressures remained constant. Furthermore, the observed changes were found to occur in both the bulk and the surface of the catalyst. Catalytic cycling revealed that morphological transformations and structural dynamics have different implications on the reactivity and are mostly irreversible.									18	2	0	0	3	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300030

However, tackling the key problem of cocatalyst loading position over heterojunction photocatalysts is still a great challenge. We herein report a facile and general light-tuning photodeposition strategy to realize site-directed spatial loading of diverse cocatalysts (MoS2, NixS, NixO, NixP, Pt) onto a CdS/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst, thereby abating surface charge recombination and markedly improving the photoredox-catalyzed activity of hydrogen evolution and selective oxidation of alcohol. This work highlights the wide scope of manipulating light to spatially regulate the cocatalyst loading position, thereby optimizing surface/interface charge recombination dynamics and ameliorating the net efficiency of charge separation and photoredox catalysis.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300031

The surface -anchored nano-MOFs (SA-NMOFs) were prepared by covalent anchoring of a presynthesized, functionalized UiO-66 nano-MOF (NMOF) on surface-modified poly(dimethylsiloxane). The SA-NMOFs exhibit discrete NMOFs (<30 nm) which do not aggregate. The SA-NMOFs retain a high surface area, rendering them interesting catalysts. We compared the catalytic activities of SA-NMOFs in the cyanosilylation of benzaldehyde with those of the bulk UiO-66 and colloidal-dispersed UiO-66 NMOFs (size: 22 +/- 3 nm). The SA-NMOFs exhibit a boost in activity by a factor of 100,000-1,000,000 owing to (a) the generally larger surface area of NMOFs and (b) the suppressed aggregation of the nanoparticles by surface immobilization. In contrast, colloidal NMOFs rapidly aggregate, as shown by dynamic light scattering. The general applicability of our approach for other Lewis acid-catalyzed reactions is demonstrated by comparing the activities of the three catalyst systems for the cycloaddition of CO2 and propylene oxide to propylene carbonate, where SA-NMOFs by far outperform the bulk MOFs and defect-engineered MOFs, respectively. This discovery paves the way for application of SA-NMOFs as efficient catalyst materials.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300032

In addition to intrinsic activity control, geometrical factors of electrocatalysts such as their porous structure have been demonstrated to affect the reaction selectivity, but understanding its origin is still important. Herein, we demonstrate that reduced graphene oxide layers can effectively control the Faradaic efficiency for CO production of porous zinc nanoparticle electrocatalysts. Simply tuning for CO production from 66 to 94% even in the bicarbonate electrolyte the coverage of graphene oxide dramatically varies Faradaic efficiency at the same biased potential, in which the hydrogen evolution rate was notably suppressed without sacrificing CO2 reduction to CO production rate unlike many Zn-based electrocatalysts. The graphene oxide layers are revealed to play roles in providing geometric barriers for the mass transport channels of reactants rather than changing the chemical states of the Zn-based electrocatalysts according to in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical reaction kinetic studies. In addition, computational fluid dynamics simulation studies estimate the Faradaic efficiency dependence on the surface coverage and suggest that the selective suppression of H-2 evolution is associated with the larger increment in local pH compared to that in local pCO(2) at the porous electrocatalyst surfaces. Decoupling between these reactant concentrations is originated from the higher consumption rate and lower bulk concentration of proton compared to those of CO2, and the surface coating with graphene oxide can be an effective way to control mass transport channel.									18	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300034

In this contribution, we report the performance of In2O3 with different crystal phases in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, where we observe changing activity induced by a phase transition under reaction conditions. Cubic In2O3 (c-In2O3) exhibits a higher RWGS rate than the hexagonal phase (h-In2O3) at temperatures below 350 degrees C because of its (1) enhanced dissociative adsorption of H-2, (2) facile formation of the oxygen vacancies, and (3) enhanced ability to adsorb and activate CO2 on the oxygen vacancies, as suggested both experimentally and computationally. Density functional theory results indicate that the surface oxygen arrangement on the cubic polymorph is key to rapid H-2 adsorption, which facilitates oxygen vacancy formation and subsequent CO2 adsorption to yield high RWGS reactivity. At 450 degrees C and above, the activity of h-In2O3 increases gradually with time on stream, which is caused by a phase transition from h-In2O3 to c-In2O3. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments show that h-In2O3 is first reduced by H-2 and subsequently oxidized by CO2 to c-In2O3. These findings highlight the importance of the crystal phase in the catalytic RWGS reaction and provide a new dimension for understanding/designing RWGS catalysts.									29	1	0	0	4	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300038

Upon the incorporation of Zr into the ceria support, the catalyst exhibited a significantly improved activity and H-2 selectivity. To understand the effects of the Zr dopant on Ni and CeO2 during the dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction and to probe the structure-reactivity relationship underlying the enhanced catalytic performance of the mixed-oxide system, in situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) were employed to characterize the catalysts under reaction conditions. TR-XRD and AP-XPS indicate that ceria-zirconia supported Ni (Ni/CeZrO2) is of higher reducibility than the pure ceria supported Ni (Ni/CeO2) upon the reaction with pure CH4 or for the methane dry reforming reaction. The active state of Ni/CeZrO2 under optimum DRM conditions (700 degrees C) was identified as Ni, Ce3+/Ce4+, and Zr4+. The particle size of both nickel and the ceria support under reaction conditions was analyzed by Rietveld refinement and extended XAFS fitting. Zr in the ceria support prevents particle sintering and maintains small particle sizes for both metallic nickel and the partially reduced ceria support under reaction conditions through a stronger-metal support interaction. Additionally, Zr prevents Ni migration from the surface into ceria forming a Ce1-xNixO2-y solid solution, which is seen in Ni/CeO2, thus helping to preserve the active Ni-0 on the Ni/CeZrO2 surface.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300039

A high performance was observed with a Pd-ZnO/TiO2 catalyst, with 99.9% DMA selectivity at 94% MA conversion. By contrast, both Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZnO were less active and/or selective. The catalytic performance of Pd-ZnO/TiO2 largely depended on reduction temperature and ZnO loading. The rates for MA conversion (rate(MA)) and DMA production (rate(DMA)) increased linearly with the amount of PdZn alloy formed. The reaction was likely to take place via intermediates of N-methylformanilide (MFA) and formate. Formate was produced through the reduction of CO2 with H-2 as confirmed by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and then added to MA producing MFA, and finally, MFA was subsequently adsorbed and hydrogenated to DMA. All these steps were promoted by the PdZn alloy. The hydrogenation of MFA to DMA was much faster than the N-methylation of MA to MFA; DMA was stable, so the selectivity to DMA was almost 100% over the Pd-ZnO/TiO2 catalyst.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300040

Among these, ZSM-5 is the most investigated solid that can be obtained in various forms, with some of these (hierarchical forms, nanoslabs, nano-sheets, and nanocrystals) exhibiting a very high external surface to volume ratio. Whereas most knowledge obtained so far at the atomic level concerns the internal nanopores, we here propose a density functional theory (DFT) study to establish the relative stability of relevant surface orientations for silicalite and ZSM-S crystals ((100), (010), and (101)) at different hydration levels to identify the equilibrium morphology of the particles and the major sites present on their surfaces. Several kinds of surface sites have been identified. Bridging Al-OH-Si groups are present at the pore mouth with stability similar to or higher than those in bulk sites. Yet, these groups are not stable at the outermost surface, where the following groups prevail: Si-OH, Al-OH groups, and most importantly water adsorbed on aluminum, Al-(H2O)(OH)(n). Water desorption reactions occur at temperatures that strongly depend on the local topology of the surface site and on the surface orientation: when a siloxane bridge is present below the surface Al atom, water desorption is promoted by the formation of an additional Al-O bond with the oxygen of the siloxane bridge. However, if such a bridge is not present below the surface aluminum atom, desorption leads to a less stable surface Al-III atom. The desorption temperature is influenced by this feature, as well as by the stabilization of the water molecule by hydrogen bonds, depending on the silanol content of the surface. This has in turn direct consequences on the Bronsted and Lewis acid properties, as probed by pyridine. Strong Lewis acid sites can easily be formed on the (010) orientation (relevant for nanosheets), whereas they are unlikely to occur at the (101) surface (tips of coffin-shaped particles), which promotes the mild Bronsted acid sites Al-(H2O) instead.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300041

The HER activity of the group 5 TMDs originates from the unsaturated chalcogen edges and the highly active surface basal planes, whereas the HER activity of the widely studied group 6 TMDs originates solely from the chalcogen- or metal-unsaturated edges. However, the batch production of such nanomaterials and their scalable processing into high-performance electrocatalysts is still challenging. Herein, we report the liquid-phase exfoliation of the 2H-TaS2 crystals by using 2-propanol to produce single/few-layer (1H/2H) flakes, which are afterward deposited as catalytic films. A thermal treatment-aided texturization of the catalytic films is used to increase their porosity, promoting the ion access to the basal planes of the flakes, as well as the number of catalytic edges of the flakes. The hybridization of the H-TaS2 flakes and H-TaSe2 flakes tunes the Gibbs free energy of the adsorbed atomic hydrogen onto the H-TaS2 basal planes to the optimal thermo-neutral value. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the heterogeneous catalysts exhibit a low overpotential (versus RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) at the cathodic current of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) of 120 mV and high mass activity of 314 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 200 mV. In 1 M KOH, they show a eta(10) of 230 mV and a mass activity of 220 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV. Our results provide new insight into the usage of the metallic group 5 TMDs for the HER through scalable material preparation and electrode processing.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300042	33815892

In this work, we show that the framework Al atoms are enriched around intracrystalline mesopores that encapsulate Pt nanoparticles in H-ZSM-S, referred to as the "halo effect". The molecular level proximity between Bronsted acid and Pt sites is demonstrated by quantitative Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The halo effect enables the selective conversion of furfural to valeric acid and ethyl valerate (VA/EV) via a 5-step tandem reaction in one pot with an 86% yield. In contrast, control experiments show that catalysts with identical metal and acid site densities but without the halo effect produce only a 5% yield of VA/EV under identical conditions. The ready access of intermediates to the active sites in the subsequent reaction enabled by the halo effect is key to the enhanced performance in tandem catalysis and reduced catalyst deactivation.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300044

Through both in vitro and in vivo analysis, we provide a plausible enzymatic pathway for CHC-CoA biosynthesis from shikimate. This pathway highlights a shikimoyl-CoA synthetase that is highly promiscuous toward a wide range of cycloalkane and benzoate substrates. In addition, an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is shown to have evolved to be a FAD-dependent nonredox dehydratase that is distinct from any known FAD-dependent dehydratases.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300046

Herein, aimed at elucidating pyridine modification-carbonylation activity relationships and developing high-performance catalysts, we investigated the adsorption/desorption behaviors of pyridine on MOR zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios and their impact on DME carbonylation. Instead of the previously proposed selective adsorption of pyridine in 12-MR channels, pyridine is revealed to penetrate into 8-MR side pockets of MOR zeolites and interact with acidic hydroxyls therein. Upon heating, pyridine in pockets desorbs preferentially, likely arising from the lower stability of pyridine adspecies in constrained spaces. This well explains the observed of carbonylation activity following the increase of pretreatment temperature. Unprecedentedly, high MA yield (7.2 mmol/(h g)) has been achieved on pyridine-modified MOR (Si/Al = 13.8) under controlled pyridine desorption conditions, resulting from the joint contributions of better diffusion properties and larger amounts of active acid sites. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Bronsted acid sites within 8-MR pockets is demonstrated to be inhomogeneous, closely associated with their locations.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300048

A bulk Pt piece is usually used as a counter electrode in such systems because of its high activity and stability in many electrochemical reactions. However, the dissolution of the Pt counter electrode led to growing concern about inaccurate evaluation of the inherent characteristics of the analyte. In the present study, we have demonstrated that strong interferences emerged from the conventional Pt counter and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes in the photo electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a model photocathode of p-type silicon (p-Si). Under light illumination, the Pt counter electrode is polarized to as high as 1.6-2.0 V-RHE, which leads to a non-negligible Pt dissolution from the oxidized surface, as monitored by operando inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Postreaction spectroscopy and microscopy studies confirm the formation of Pt and Ag particles on p-Si photocathode, resulting in erroneous overestimation of the HER activity of p-Si. Various configurations of the three-electrode system, e.g., an H-type cell with a Nafion membrane, have been studied to find a suitable cell structure for prohibiting undesirable contamination of p-Si. Isolation of p-Si from the Pt counter and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes using the Nafion membrane effectively alleviates the contamination of p-Si but, toward the end, the metallic ions can be slowly deposited on p-Si by diffusion through the membrane. Consequently, this work highlights that the careful caution is necessary when the conventional Pt counter and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes are employed; it is recommended to use a graphite counter electrode and separate reference electrode to prevent artifacts originating from the dissolved Pt and Ag species during PEC cathode evaluations.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300049

Various noble-metal-based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been reported for this process. The development of cheap non-noble-metal heterogeneous catalysts for the N-alkylation reaction would be highly desirable. Hereby, we propose the N-alkylation of amines by alcohols over a cheap and efficient heterogeneous catalyst-titanium hydroxide. This catalyst provides a selectivity higher than 90% to secondary amines for functionalized aromatic and aliphatic alcohols and amines with high catalytic activity and stability. Mild Bronsted acidity formed by the continuous rehydration of Lewis acidity excludes the side reactions and deactivation by adsorbed species. The mechanism of the reaction involves dehydration of alcohols to ethers with subsequent C-O bond cleavage by amine with the formation of secondary amine and recovery of alcohol.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300052

The optimum performance reported by us recently [ACS Catal. 2019, 9, 9150-9157] in terms of selectivity toward the formation of cinnamyl alcohol, the desired product, by the catalyst with x = 0.005 was corroborated. A rapid decrease was seen in catalytic activity in batch reactors with all catalysts, in particular with pure Cu/SBA-15. This was ascribed, based on DFT calculations and microkinetic simulations, to the relative weak adsorption of the reactant compared to that of the products, which leads to the blocking of catalytic sites by the latter early on in the catalytic runs. It was determined that selectivity is controlled by the relative values of the initial rate constants for hydrogenation to the unsaturated alcohol versus the saturated aldehyde. Those were found to vary by up to an order of magnitude as a function of Pt content in the catalyst, in spite of the fact that the hydrogenation steps are presumed to occur on Cu, not Pt, sites. In general, significant changes in equilibrium and kinetic parameters were seen across the series of catalysts tested (versus x), indicating that the addition of even small amounts of Pt to these Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts affects the intrinsic performance of the hydrogenation catalytic sites.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300055

However, real materials are unlikely to display a uniform site structure, which limits the scope of current efforts focused on idealized models for future implementation. Here, we prepare distinct nickel entities (single atoms or nanoparticles) on nitrogen-doped carbons and evaluate them in eCO(2)RR. Single atoms demonstrate a characteristic high selectivity to CO. However, this is not altered by the presence of metal nanoparticles formed upon reducing the nitrogen content of the carrier. In contrast, nanoparticles incorporated via a colloidal route promote the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. In these systems, the CO selectivity evolves upon repeated exposure to potential, reaching values comparable to single atoms. By introducing CO stripping voltammetry as a characterization tool for this class of materials, we identify a decreased metallic surface, suggesting that the nanoparticle surface is altered by CO. The findings highlight the critical role of dynamic effects in catalyst design for eCO(2)RR.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300056

Herein, a distinct class of one-dimensional (1D) ultrathin Pt3Sn nanofibers (NFs) with controllable aspect ratios and intermetallic structure was designed as highly efficient EOR electrocatalysts. The optimized structurally ordered Pt3Sn NFs with the largest aspect ratio (Pt3Sn NFs-L) show the highest activity and long-term stability compared with the commercial Pt/C and other counterparts. Apart from the intrinsic structural advantages, the incorporated Sn on Pt3Sn NFs-L can effectively alleviate the binding strength of reaction intermediates and further promote the electrooxidation of intermediates by providing abundant oxophilic species, largely contributing to the enhanced EOR activity and stability. Detailed investigations indicate that Pt3Sn NFs-L possess a strong capacity for C-C bond cleavage in ethanol, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. Moreover, Pt3Sn NFs-L with highlighted antipoisoning property can also display enhanced performance for the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), demonstrating its promising performance in various alcohol electrooxidation reactions.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300057

Having been pioneered in the primitive stages (particularly unary and binary catalysis), the field has witnessed the inception of "Ternary Catalysis" described as the concept of harnessing an ensemble effect of three discrete catalysts in one-pot. Although the concept is nascent, it has already demonstrated its invaluable importance in terms of producing novel reactivity, prodigious selectivity, and efficiency. As evident from the presented documentation, the number of pertinent reports utilizing ternary catalysis has drastically increased in the past few years; however, these reports remain scattered in the literature. The conceptualization and unambiguous catalyst-dependent classification presented herein provides an imperative unified approach to assemble and categorize all such reports which have remained missing by far. Special emphasis has been given to mechanistic analysis clearly disclosing the beauty of ternary catalysis. For the better understanding of the concept, a succinct description of challenges and problems associated in the development of a ternary catalytic system has been presented. In addition, the Review briefly discusses some of the unsolved problems and possible developments in this field.									32	0	0	0	4	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300058

The present reaction can transfer an ester functional group from certain aromatic esters to haloarenes. This ester transfer reaction involves two oxidative additions-one from the C-C bond of the aromatic ester and one from the C-halogen bond of haloarenes-onto a nickel catalyst. The utilization of a Ni/dcypt catalyst capable of cleaving both chemical bonds was a key for the reaction progress. Furthermore, naphthol-based aryl electrophiles were also applicable to the catalytic system via C-O bond activation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300059

Reducing the particle size from a few nanometers down to atomically dispersed single atoms alters both the morphology and electronic property of the metal enormously, thus greatly modulating its catalytic performance. Detailed investigation of the particle size effect as well as taking account of a metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), the frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, can provide a deeper insight into structure-activity relations and facilitate the rational design of advanced metal catalysts. However, such studies have been rarely reported. Herein, Cu single atoms and nanoparticles with different sizes of about 3.4, 7.3, and 9.3 nm were synthesized on an alumina support using atomic layer deposition. Comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic characterization shows that the Cu single atoms remain very stable and have 1+ valence state after reduction at 300 degrees C in hydrogen. In semihydrogenation of acetylene in excess of ethylene, we show that a decrease in the Cu particle size reduces the activity considerably but gradually improves both the ethylene selectivity and durability. In particular, the Cu SAC exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity of 91% at the complete conversion along with excellent long-term stability for at least 40 h, in sharp contrast with the rapid deactivation on Cu nanoparticle catalysts. In situ thermogravimetry measurements further reveal that coke formation on Cu-1 SAC is significantly suppressed by up to similar to 89% compared to that on the 9.3 nm Cu nanoparticle catalysts. In brief, our findings demonstrate that SACs can be promising candidates for selective hydrogenation reactions in terms of high selectivity and high coking resistance.									31	3	0	0	0	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300060

Thermal catalysis of ethane to ethylene, mainly oxidative dehydrogenation, faces the fundamental challenge of low conversion, low selectivity, and catalyst coking. This work demonstrates an efficient conversion of ethane to ethylene in a nonoxidative dehydrogenation process in a proton-conducting solid oxide electrolyzer at ambient pressure and 700 degrees C. We show the highest ethane conversion of 75.2% and similar to 100% ethylene selectivity even only at 0.8 V in this electrochemical catalysis process. The electrochemical pumping of protons at anode with active exsolved metal-oxide interfaces enhances anode activity, while the metal-oxide interface interactions further engineer the ethane conversion in the electrochemical dehydrogenation process. We exsolve metal-oxide interface architecture at nanoscale on the electrode scaffold to improve coking resistance and catalyst stability. We further present the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide in the cathode combined with ethane conversion in the anode, and we show the higher performance of ethane conversion in the anode with syngas production in the cathode. The electrochemical dehydrogenation process would provide an alternative method for the petrochemical production and a thermochemical practice in a clean energy mode.									26	3	0	0	0	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300061

This reaction provides stereodefined trisubstituted homoallyl alcohol derivatives that bear a synthetically useful alkenyl silane moiety. The results of a computational study suggested that the silyl directing group thermodynamically stabilizes the sterically hindered allylcopper(I) intermediate and kinetically facilitates the carbonyl allylation path for the linear product by lowering the energy of its transition state.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400008

This zwitterionic amidate is stable yet amenable to single-electron oxidation for generating a highly reactive amidyl radical. In cooperation with an Ir-based visible-light photoredox catalyst, the optimal catalyst enables the efficient direct alkylation of the C-H bonds of various nitrogen-or oxygen-containing organic compounds.									21	1	0	0	5	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400025

A manganese(I) complex bearing a phosphine-free ligand catalyzed the reaction, which involved the formation of two C-C bonds via a sequence of intermolecular- and intramolecular-borrowing hydrogenation reactions. It produces 2 mol of water as the sole byproduct, making the process atom economical and environmentally benign. Multisubstituted cycloalkanes were obtained in good to excellent yields with very high selectivities. A thorough mechanistic analysis by high-level DFT computation rationalizes the choice of the pincer and establishes the role of hemilability of the ligand for this efficient transformation.									25	0	0	0	4	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400024

The terminal oxidant is a stoichiometric amount of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, an environmentally benign reagent. Up to 96% enantiomeric excess and 99% yields were achieved for 1,1'-disubstituted and 1,2-disubstituted allylic protected amines and 1,2-disubstituted homoallylic protected amines. The identity of the ion pair catalyst was uncovered using X-ray crystallography and revealed that the achiral tetraperoxyditungstate anion species [(WO2)-O-2(mu-O)(O-2)(4)](2-) is nudged nicely into the central cavity of the chiral dication. The ion pair catalyst was also characterized using infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 6570-6573). In this work, the related Co(-I) end-on dinitrogen adducts, [(N-2)CoML](-), were isolated and investigated as precatalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The Co-Ga catalyst was highly active, achieving 19,200 formate turnovers with an initial turnover frequency of 27,000 h(-1) under 34 atm of 1:1 CO2/H-2 and using Verkades proazaphosphatrane as a base at ambient temperature. The Co-Al catalyst was moderately active, while the Co-In complex was inactive. Hence, tuning the group 13 ion greatly influences the catalytic activity at the Co site. To elucidate the role of the group 13 support, experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies of the Co-Ga and Co-Al catalysts were conducted. The Co(-I) H-2 species are potent hydride donors with estimated thermodynamic hydricities (Delta G degrees(H-)) of 32.0(1) and 37.4(1) kcal/mol in CH3CN for M = Al and Ga, respectively. By acting as masked Co(I) dihydrides, the Co(-I) H-2 species operate via an unusual Co(-I)/Co(I) redox cycle. After hydride transfer to CO2, the resulting intermediate is the Co(I) hydride complex, HCoML, which was independently synthesized and structurally characterized for M = Al and Ga. The Gibbs free energy for H-2 binding, Delta G degrees(bind) (1 atm), to generate (eta(2)-H-2)HCoML was slightly more favorable for HCoGaL (-4.2(1) kcal/mol) than for HCoAlL (-2.7(1) kcal/mol). In the subsequent step, the deprotonation reaction to regenerate the initial catalyst was much more favorable for (eta(2)-H-2)HCoGaL (pK(a) of 31.4, CH3CN) than for (eta(2)-H-2)HCoAlL (pK(a) of 34.3). The straightforward substitution of Al with Ga perturbs the energy profile of the catalytic reaction (vertical bar Delta Delta G degrees(H-)vertical bar = 5.4 kcal/mol, vertical bar Delta G degrees(bind)vertical bar = 1.5 kcal/mol, and vertical bar Delta Delta G degrees(Ka)vertical bar = 4.0 kcal/mol) and thus provides a thermodynamic rationale for the higher catalytic efficiency of Co-Ga over Co-Al.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400007

Its capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a virulence factor and is a key component in NmW CPS-protein conjugate vaccines. The current clinically used NmW CPS protein conjugate vaccines are effective, but the costs are high and the products are heterogeneous at both the CPS and conjugate levels. Toward the development of potentially better NmW CPS vaccines, herein we report the synthesis of homogeneous oligosaccharides of NmW CPS in a size-controlled manner using polysaccharide synthase NmSiaD(W) in a sequential one-pot multienzyme platform. Taking advantage of the obtained structurally defined synthetic oligosaccharides tagged with a hydrophobic chromophore, detailed biochemical characterization of NmSiaD(W) has been achieved. While the catalytic efficiency of the galactosyl-transferase activity of NmSiaD(W) increases dramatically with the increase of the sialoside acceptor substrate size, the size difference of the galactoside acceptor substrate does not influence NmSiaD(W) sialyltransferase activity significantly. The ratio of donor and acceptor substrate concentrations, but not the size of the acceptor substrates, has been found to be the major determining factor for the sizes of the oligosaccharides produced. NmW CPS oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization (DP) higher than 65 have been observed. The study provides a better understanding of NmSiaD(W) capsular polysaccharide synthase and showcases an efficient chemoenzymatic synthetic platform for obtaining structurally defined NmW CPS oligosaccharides in a size-controlled manner.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400041	33414981

Deciphering the functional significance of these ligands requires a quantitative understanding of how their electron-donating capabilities modulate the structures and reactivities of the iconic ferryl intermediates compounds I and II. However, probing these relationships experimentally has proven to be challenging as ligand substitutions accessible via conventional mutagenesis do not allow fine tuning of electron donation and typically abolish catalytic function. Here, we exploit engineered translation components to replace the histidine ligand of cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) by a less electron-donating N-delta-methyl histidine (Me-His) with little effect on the enzyme structure. The rate of formation (k(1)) and the reactivity (k(2)) of compound I are unaffected by ligand substitution. In contrast, proton-coupled electron transfer to compound II (k(3)) is 10-fold slower in CcP Me-His, providing a direct link between electron donation and compound II reactivity, which can be explained by weaker electron donation from the Me-His ligand (the push) affording an electron-deficient ferryl oxygen with reduced proton affinity (the pull). The deleterious effects of the Me-His ligand can be fully compensated by introducing a W51F mutation designed to increase the pull by removing a hydrogen bond to the ferryl oxygen. Analogous substitutions in ascorbate peroxidase lead to similar activity trends to those observed in CcP, suggesting that a common mechanistic strategy is employed by enzymes using distinct electron transfer pathways. Our study highlights how noncanonical active site substitutions can be used to directly probe and deconstruct highly evolved bioinorganic mechanisms.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400036	32550044

However, less work has focused on the effect of iron-oxygen composition on the characteristic of charge transport and interfacial reaction. Here, we investigated the charge transfer and interface reaction of two typical iron-oxygen compositions of hematite prepared from the precursors of Fe and FeOOH in which different iron-oxygen ratios were obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy etching confirms that different precursors do cause differences in spatial elemental composition after thermal treatment. For Fe precursors, oxygen deficiency in the bulk is responsible for its lower bulk efficiency, whereas the defect-free surface results in a high surface separation efficiency and a low interfacial reaction catalysis rate. The FeOOH precursor forms an oxygen-rich surface and, therefore, introduces a large number of surface hole traps. Excessive traps significantly hinder surface charge separation and transport but favor surface electrocatalytic kinetics. Our work provides a perspective on the relationship between the semiconductor electrode performance and its structure and provides effective guidance for further optimization.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400002

Herein, an effective strategy was developed through the combination of partially reduced Zn-Cr-Al trinary oxides (ZnCrAlOx) and Mo-based sulfides to significantly raise the alcohol selectivity. The introduction of K on Mo-based sulfides suppresses the acid sites and stabilizes alkoxy species (CHxO*), which greatly enhances the selectivity of alcohols. The close proximity of the two components on the multifunctional relay catalyst ZnCrAlOx vertical bar KNiMoS-MMO-5 can effectively promote the migration of reaction intermediates by shifting the DME formation equilibrium on ZnCrAlOx, achieving an alcohol selectivity of 60.4% with more than similar to 72.7% of C2+OH selectivity in alcohols under a CO conversion of 9.8%, and significantly improves the turnover frequency (TOF) of C2+OH (71.9 h(-1)). A plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed on the multifunctional relay catalyst ZnCrAlOx vertical bar KNiMoS-MMO-5. This work provides a promising avenue to improve the selectivity of higher alcohols through a multifunctional relay catalyst affording multiple types of active sites.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400003

To mitigate energy and environmental challenges, renewable ammonia production technologies based on electrochemical and photochemical methods, in particular, photocatalytic nitrogen fixation in aqueous phase for ammonia production is highly desired. In the present work, single-atom Pt anchored at the -N-3 sites of stable and ultrathin covalent triazine framework (CTF) nanosheets have been successfully synthesized (Pt-SACs/CTF). The well-defined coordination structure of Pt-N-3 sites in the Pt-SACs/CTF catalyst have been characterized using HAADF-STEM and EXAFS, as well as ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The ammonia production rate over the as-synthesized Pt-SACs/CTF catalyst is 171.40 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in the absence of sacrificial agent. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, it has been found that the alternating mechanism is energetically more favorable than the distal mechanism over the well-defined Pt-N-3 sites. The significance of the present work is to demonstrate that the single-atom metal catalysts are anchored at the two-dimensional stable CTF nanosheets for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation to ammonia.									48	1	0	0	2	0	48			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400004

Herein, a facile strategy has been provided for synthesizing hexagonal Fe2N nanocrystals dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), through direct pyrolysis of a mixture of carbon black, ferric chloride (FeCl3), and melamine in an argon atmosphere, followed by ammonia activation at 700 degrees C. The obtained Fe2N/NC catalyst exhibits both ultrahigh ORR activity and favorable long-term durability in alkaline solutions, which exceeds the state-of-the-art Pt/C even in Zn-air batteries. Acid etching and KSCN poisoning experiments confirm that the remarkable performances are mainly attributed to the hexagonal nitride with special crystal facets that existed in this hybrid. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that the oxygen adsorption energy of the exposed Fe2N((11) over bar1) plane is -1.14 eV, very close to that of Pt(111). More importantly, at 0.85 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the free energy diagram of the ORR on this exposed crystal facet is closer to the ideal path than that of the Fe-N-4 bonds that existed in this hybrid, suggesting that the ORR process over Fe2N is easier than that over Fe-N-C catalysts. This work may provide an idea for fabricating nitrides or carbides with controlled crystal facets as efficient non-Pt catalysts for hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells or metal-air batteries.									20	2	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400005

However, the heat treatment involved in the material preparation excites Fe aggregating into nanosized species with low activity rather than single-atom Fe sites. Herein, we propose a ceria-assisted strategy to preferentially generate active single-atom Fe sites in Fe-N-C materials, which involves oxidative polymerization of pyrrole, Ce3+ and Fe3+ adsorption, and subsequent heat treatment. Because of its spatial confinement and strong trapping for Fe atoms, ceria can effectively suppress agglomeration of isolated Fe atoms and stabilize the Fe atoms by bonding to O in the lattice during the heat treatment, leading to a high content of atomically dispersed Fe (4.6 wt %). Accordingly, the final catalyst showed ultrahigh ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.915 V and kinetic current density of 7.15 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V. When used at the cathode in anion exchange membrane fuel cell, a maximum power density of 496 mW cm(-2) was achieved, which is one of the best performance reported in the literature for Fe-N-C-type electrocatalysts.									33	3	0	0	0	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400006

Here, we report an aldol-aromatic mechanism composed of aldol, phenolic, and aromatic cycles, that gave high selectivity >70% of a single product, tetramethylbenzene (TeMB) in hydrocarbons, at a reaction temperature as low as 275 degrees C. We evidently found the existence of oxygenated-aromatic compounds in the carbon pool, which remained active throughout the reaction and acted as key intermediates for the formation of the aromatics. The physical contact of ZnCr2O4 with H-ZSM-5 exhibited a strong coupling effect that promoted surface diffusion of C-1 oxygenates (i.e., formaldehyde and methanol) from ZnCr2O4 into H-ZSM-5 and transformed into aromatics via an aldol-aromatic reaction pathway, thus overcoming the most difficult step for first carbon-carbon bond formation. In addition, ZnCr2O4 promoted the aromatics desorption by lowering the desorption activation energy and prevented the oversaturation of carbon pool species. Furthermore, it was found that a combination of thermodynamic equilibrium, surface methylation, and static repulsion are the key factors for giving high selectivity of TeMB in both carbon pool and final aromatics. This aldol-aromatic mechanism will open an efficient reaction pathway to upscale the process for selective aromatic synthesis in high yield from syngas.									7	2	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400009

Sintering of metal nanoparticles on supports affects catalyst stability. To alleviate this problem, a series of highly stable Ru-supported catalysts with controlled metal nanoparticle sizes have been prepared via the easy incipient wetness impregnation method. These catalysts were used for APR of glycerol to produce H-2. Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons (NMCs) were utlized as supports and found to have a strong influence on the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Incorporation of nitrogen in the carbon framework significantly enhanced the catalytic activity compared to Ru catalysts on nitrogen-free supports. Notably, the catalyst (5 wt % Ru-NMC-3) with optimal N content (10.9 wt %) demonstrated improved stability and H-2 selectivity, which are better than those of many state-of-the-art catalysts. Nitrogen in the carbon framework has a dual relationship with the activity of the catalyst: (i) it creates basic environment over the catalysts support and (ii) it acts as an anchoring site for metal nanoparticles. Anchoring of metal nanoparticles has helped to curb their sintering, thus leading to better stability of the catalysts under APR reaction conditions. Various characterization techniques were employed to understand the nature of active catalytic sites responsible for higher H-2 production while minimizing CO formation. In situ CO-FTIR studies showed that the higher catalytic activity of 5 wt % Ru-NMC-3 catalyst was attributed to the enhanced WGS activity over this catalyst. Density functional theory calculations were performed to understand the stabilization of metal nanoparticles by different types of N present on the support and provide insights into the prefered sites of glycerol adsorption on the NMC support. Since S wt % Ru-NMC-3 was the relatively best catalyst, it was selected for the preparation of bimetallic catalysts. Accordingly, addition of Pt to this system helped to increase the stability of the catalyst. This bimetallic catalyst may, therefore, find application for wide use in APR of biomass oxygenates.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400010

Nonthermally oxidized Ir nanoparticles supported on antimony-doped tin oxide (SnO2:Sb, ATO) aerogel allow decreasing the use of the precious metal by more than 70% while enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability. To date, the origin of these benefits remains unknown. Here, we present clear evidence of the mechanisms that lead to the enhancement of the electrochemical properties of the catalyst. Operando near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on membrane electrode assemblies reveals a low degree of Ir oxidation, attributed to the oxygen spill-over from Ir to SnO2:Sb. Furthermore, the formation of highly unstable Ir(III) species is mitigated, while the decrease of Ir dissolution in Ir/SnO2:Sb is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The mechanisms that lead to the high activity and stability of Ir catalysts supported on SnO2:Sb aerogel for PEMWE are thus unveiled.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400011

Two desorption peaks were observed: a peak at 370 K was attributed to molecular desorption of H2O, and a peak at 510 K was attributed to recombinative desorption of H2O. The amount of dissociated H2O adsorbed on the Au/TiO2(110) surface increased in inverse proportion to the second power of the mean Au particle diameter in the range of 1-10 nm and increased linearly with increasing perimeter length around the Au particles, indicating that H2O dissociates to H and OH at the perimeter interface between the Au and TiO2. We also found that the H2O dissociation reaction and the oxidation of CO proceeded at the same active sites. We believe that the oxidation of CO is initiated by the dissociation of H2O. The obtained results provide a deeper experimental insight on a role of H2O in the oxidation of CO over Au/TiO2 catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400012

Herein we report the biocatalytic aldol condensation of acetaldehyde with various aromatic aldehydes to give a number of aromatic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes using a previously engineered variant of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase [4-OT(M4ST/FSOA)] as carboligase. Moreover, an efficient one-pot two-step chemoenzymatic route toward chiral aromatic 1,3-diols has been developed. This one-pot chemoenzymatic strategy successfully combined a highly enantioselective aldol addition step catalyzed by a proline-based carboligase [4-OT(M4ST/F50A) or TAUT015] with a chemical reduction step to convert enzymatically prepared aromatic beta-hydroxyaldehydes into the corresponding 1,3-diols with high optical purity (e.r. up to >99:1) and in good isolated yield (51-92%). These developed (chemo)enzymatic methodologies offer alternative synthetic choices to prepare a variety of important drug precursors.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400013	32117575

In this study, we used in situ dispersive X-ray absorption fine structure (DXAFS) measurements to observe the lattice oxygen dynamics in SrFeO3-delta and Sr3Fe2O7-delta during NO oxidation. The white-line intensities of Sr K-edge XAFS reflect the concentration of oxygen vacancies, and the lattice oxygen dynamics during NO oxidation are observed. Using a kinetics model, the rate-determining step (RDS) for NO oxidation was found to be an oxygen migration step. The activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plots for Sr3Fe2O7-delta is much smaller than that obtained for SrFeO3-delta. Sr3Fe2O7-delta with a Ruddlesden-Popper-type layered perovskite can release oxygen with relatively small structural rearrangements. In contrast SrFeO3-delta requires a significant rearrangement of oxygen vacancies to form the brownmillerite phase and the transformation restricts the oxygen release rate. The oxygen storage profiles with O-2 also show that the RDS is the oxygen migration step, although the dissociative adsorption of O-2 suppresses oxygen storage at low temperatures. The lattice oxygen dynamics obtained from the DXAFS measurements, which cannot be obtained from steady-state kinetics experiments, reveal the importance of the perovskite structure for NO oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400014

This catalytic activity is exemplified by the highly stereoselective preparation of seven branched ketols with good yields.

First, the chain length distribution of the products follows a broad and unselective Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. Second, mostly linear hydrocarbons are formed in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, thus requiring isomerization while manufacturing gasoline fuels. The present paper addresses a synthetic strategy for the preparation of hierarchical metal and zeolite nanocomposite catalysts for direct synthesis of iso-paraffins from syngas. The nanocomposites are synthesized in three steps. In the first step, the parent (core) zeolite is etched with an ammonium fluoride solution. The etching creates small mesopores inside the zeolite crystals. In the second step, the Ru nanoparticles prepared using water-in-oil microemulsion are deposited in the mesopores of the zeolite. In the third step, a zeolite shell of MFI-type zeolites (silicalite-1 or ZSM-5) is grown on the parent zeolite crystals coating both the etched surface and metallic nanoparticles. Thus, the metal nanoparticles become entirely encapsulated inside the zeolite matrix. Most important parameters such as ruthenium content, zeolite mesoporosity, and more particularly, the acidity of the catalyst shell, which affect the catalytic performance of the synthesized nanocomposite materials in low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis were identified in this work. The higher relative amount of iso-paraffins was observed on the catalysts containing a shell of ZSM-5. The proximity between metal and acid sites in the zeolite shell of the nanocomposite catalysts is a crucial parameter for the design of efficient metal zeolite bifunctional catalysts for selective synthesis of gasoline-type fuels via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, while the acidity of the catalyst core has only a limited impact on the catalytic performance.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400016

We demonstrate a method for identifying rate-controlling transition states and species at non(pseudo)steady-state conditions by modifiying of the definitions for degrees of rate control and sensitivities to superimpose the condition that time constants of the analytical rate function are kept constant when taking the partial derivatives of rate with respect to the rate constants/free energies. The utility of transient degrees of rate control is demonstrated for catalytic reaction net-works to rationalize features of the transient rate including extrema and discontinuities.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400017

However, the bulk immiscibility of the two metals, complicating catalyst synthesis, has limited studies of this bimetallic system. We report a solution-phase synthesis for Ni and bimetallic NiAu heterogeneous catalysts. Using oleylamine as a capping agent, an optimized synthesis for Ni catalysts led to supported particles with a narrow size distribution (4.7 +/- 0.4 nm). Gold was added to the Ni nanoparticles via galvanic displacement of Ni in organic solution, the particles were deposited onto commercial alumina, and oleylamine capping agent was removed. The catalytic activity of the bimetallic materials in 1-octyne partial hydrogenation was in between the activity of monometallic Ni and Au catalysts. At high space velocity, the bimetallic catalysts largely maintained the high alkene selectivity associated with Au catalysts (>90% alkene selectivity at a 95% conversion). At lower space velocities, the NiAu catalysts also had a reduced propensity to overhydrogenate the alkene (relative to Ni). A simple catalyst performance parameter, which combined activity, selectivity, and space velocity, was developed and used to describe the overall performance of each catalyst under varying reaction conditions. By this metric, the bimetallic catalysts had considerably better performance than monometallic Ni. The most active bimetallic catalyst was examined with a week-long stability test; it showed no activity loss with a 100% carbon balance. Catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, H-2 and N-2 adsorption, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The reactivity and characterization studies suggest the active catalysts are likely composed of bimetallic NiAu surfaces. The incorporation of Au into the catalysts suppresses H-2 adsorption on Ni, leading to lower hydrogen coverage during catalysis; this contributes to slowing undesirable alkene hydrogenation and improving catalyst selectivity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400018

Here, we demonstrate that this intriguing high activity is owing to the high concentration of Ni cationic vacancy on the nascent ultra-small NiOOH particles (<3 nm). By using first-principles calculations, we compute the thermodynamics of Ni dissolution and clarify the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the gamma-NiOOH surface. We show that (i) similar to 4% Ni cations on the surface of gamma-NiOOH dissolve at pH = 7 and 1.73 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode; (ii) on the pristine gamma-NiOOH surface, OER proceeds via the "lattice peroxide" mechanism (*H2O -> *OH -> *O-(OH)-H-latt* -> O-O-latt -> O-2) with an overpotential of 0.70 V; (iii) in the presence of Ni cationic vacancies, OER proceeds via the "hydroperoxide" mechanism (*OH + *H2O -> *2OH -> *OOH -> O-2) with an overpotential of 0.40 V. Our electronic structure and geometrical structure analyses demonstrate that the structural flexibility at the four-coordinated Ni site nearby Ni vacancy, featuring the ability to bind two terminal oxo species, is key to boost the activity. Considering the presence of the active OOH intermediate, our theory thus implies that the ultra-small oxide nanoclusters with ample cation vacancies could be a paradigm in catalyst design for oxidation reactions.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400019

In biology, respiration uses O-2 reduction as a thermodynamic sink, whereas fuel cells pair the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H2O as a proton dependent half-reaction to the oxidation of chemical fuels. Catalytic ORR processes mediated by molecular inorganic species continue to garner interest as models for heterogeneous systems. The ability to directly observe, quantify, and synthesize relevant intermediates from proposed reaction mechanisms renders molecular species readily optimizable, relative to the distribution of active sites within the nanoscale and mesoscale morphologies of heterogeneous systems. The development of next-generation cathode materials to displace platinum (Pt) for ORR will require improvements in the fundamental understanding of how O-2 behaves as a substrate, which well-defined homogeneous systems are uniquely positioned to provide. This Perspective provides a summary of recent advances in the area of homogeneous catalytic O-2 reduction, with a particular emphasis on improvements in activity and selectivity aided by mechanistic understanding.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400027

The exotic and robust metallic surface states of topological insulators (TIs) are theoretically predicted to enhance surface catalytic activity of overlaying catalysts, but no experimental evidence for TIs directly used as electrocatalysts has ever been reported. In this work, we fabricated the TI thin films of Bi2Te3 with different thicknesses using the molecular beam epitaxy method, and found that these thin films exhibit high electrocatalytic activity in HER. The 48 nm Bi2Te3 thin film has the best performance, which is attributed to its largest active area arising from the spiral growth mode of triangular domains as revealed by atomic force microscopy imaging. Importantly, our theoretical calculations reveal that while pure Bi2Te3 is not a good electrocatalyst, the Bi2Te3 thin films with partially oxidized surfaces or Te vacancies have high HER activity. The existence of the corresponding surface oxides on the Bi2Te3 thin films is supported by our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. We have also made a direct comparison between a Bi2Te3 and a Bi2Te3:Fe thin film on their magneto-transport properties and HER performances. Particularly, this work demonstrates that the topological surface states play a key role in enhancing the HER performance. Our study offers a direction to design cost-effective electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400028

Catalytic reactions using furfuryl alcohol as a substrate were limited by the formation of solid resins with the product yields showing a strong negative correlation with increasing substrate concentration and maximum yields of 1,4-pentanediol and cyclopentanol being 23 and 41%, respectively. A two-level full factorial design of experiments study with four independent input variables (temp., time, [cat.], [substrate]) and a center point was carried out for the conversion of furfuryl acetate, showing good reproducibility between replicates and no humin formation. This enabled a full statistical analysis of the input variable impact on product distribution and yield. The maximum yields of 1,4-pentanediol and cyclopentanol using furfuryl acetate as a substrate are 68 and 35%, respectively. The decreased self-reactivity of furfuryl acetate versus furfuryl alcohol dramatically increases the yields of target products but still shows a strong negative correlation of the yield of the desired products with increasing substrate concentration.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400029

However, it is known that the addition of a small amount of metal-alkyls has drastic effects on the catalyst performance, and it is one of the strategies adopted in industrial practice to tailor the properties of the polyethylene produced. In this work, we conducted a systematic investigation on the effect of triethylaluminum on the Cr(VI)/SiO2 catalyst, with the ultimate goal to determine the properties of the Cr sites at a molecular level and to correlate them to the properties of the obtained polyethylene. To this aim, we coupled kinetic tests, spectroscopic methods (diffuse reflectance UV-vis-near-infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of probe molecules), and different polymer characterization techniques. We found that, at an Al/Cr ratio of 2:1, only ca. 50% of the original Cr(VI) sites are reduced to a variety of species comprising: (1) Cr(IV) bisalkyl sites, which are probed by carbon monoxide and are the major actors in the polymerization of ethylene, explaining the faster polymerization initiation rate; (2) 6-fold coordinated Cr(III) sites, which are not accessible by probes and whose amount does not correlate with the catalyst activity; and (3) two types of monografted Cr(II) sites, all deriving from the over-reduction of the Cr(IV) bisalkyl sites, having, respectively, weak and strong Lewis acid characters, the former responsible for in situ a-olefin generation (and hence contributing to the enchainment of short polymer branching) and the latter accounting for the formation of the high-molecular-weight polymer fraction. Overall, our results demonstrate that the catalytic performance of the Cr sites depends not only on the oxidation state but rather on a combination of molecular structure, acidic character, and nature of the ancillary ligands. Hence, by tuning the structure and acidity of the Cr sites, it is possible to move from a system that essentially affords oligomers from ethylene to one that affords high-molecular-weight polymers.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400032

Furthermore, the robustness of this methodology is depicted by the late-stage modification of estrone and synthesis of vortioxetine. Remarkably, synthesis of more challenging organic materials with large ring tension under milder conditions and synthesis of some halogen contained diaryl sulfides which could not be synthesized using metal-catalyzed coupling reactions of aryl halogen are successfully accomplished with this protocol.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400033

For the latter class of catalysts, iron-doped nickel oxyhydroxide (Ni1-xFexOOH) has shown promise for replacing precious-metal-based catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2 for alkaline water electrolysis. Recently, we used first-principles quantum mechanics to illuminate the precise roles of Fe and Ni in this compound with respect to the mechanism of oxygen evolution. From periodic density functional theory using a screened-exchange hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we identified that the combined abilities of Fe to form an optimally metastable terminal oxo as Fe(IV)=O and Ni(III)'s relatively facile reduction to Ni(II) yield a very low overpotential OER In pursuit of other dopant(s) that can form other such optimal terminal oxos, here we assess the oxygen evolution mechanism and energetics when alternatively doping the beta-NiOOH((1) over bar2 (1) over bar1) surface, a catalytically active facet, with other first-row TMs, namely, V, Cr, Mn, and Co, and some second-row TMs, namely, Mo, Ru, and Rh. These dopants were chosen because their cations are known to form terminal oxos of varying strengths, and some are known to form oxides that are effective OER catalysts. Rather than finding an alternative dopant better than Fe, this study further confirms the unique chemistry of Fe that brings optimal OER activity. Co is found to be a competitive alternative to Fe, with only 0.07 V higher predicted thermodynamic overpotential. More importantly, this study also reveals the strong influence of Ni(III) on the oxidation state of the dopants, in that most dopants investigated could oxidize spontaneously to their respective high oxidation states, while lattice Ni(III) ion(s) reduce(s) concomitantly to Ni(II). Of note, V, Cr, Mo, Ru, and Rh could easily form +5, +6, +6, +7, and +5 TM-oxo groups, respectively. The enhanced stability of these high-oxidation-state cations due to the Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox render these dopants inactive toward reductive elimination of O-2, except for V, and thus we predict that they will be ineffective OER catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400035

Phosphorus can be presented in the fuel gas or as a pelletizing additive to increase the mechanical strength of the industrial extruded monolithic V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst. Herein, we demonstrated that a 2-fold increase in the intrinsic activity without detriments to N-2 selectivity and anti-H2O/SO2 stability can be achieved by incorporating V2O5WO3/TiO2 with a certain amount of phosphorus, which was generally considered as an inhibitor for such type of catalyst. Phosphorus incorporation enhanced both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites on V2O5WO3/TiO2, and NH3 bound to both sites are involved in the SCR reaction but with different rates. The molecular structure of surface vanadyl species was modulated to be more polymeric (dimer and oligomer content increases from 77% to 90%) by phosphorus incorporation through a spatial effect, during which an interaction between phosphorus and tungsten was observed. This study reveals the promotional effect of phosphorus to V2O5WO3/TiO2 catalyst, which is important for the fundamental understanding and design of vanadium-based catalyst.									31	0	0	0	9	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400037

Here, we report a nonoxide/hydroxide material, atomically dispersed dual-metal single sites (Fe-Co sites) on N-doped carbon support, as a highly active catalyst for CO oxidation. It can greatly lower the temperature for complete CO conversion as low as -73 degrees C with a turnover frequency of 0.096 s(-1). X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra, pulse-adsorption microcalorimetry, and density functional theory studies show that the Fe-Co sites synergistically catalyze CO oxidation facilely following the Langmuir Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism with CO preferentially adsorbing at the Co sites and O-2 adsorbing at the Fe sites. These results, for the first time, reveal that the dual-metal single site on N-doped carbon can efficiency catalyze low-temperature CO oxidation reaction without the involvement of supports, such as oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyl groups.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400038		
J	Lan, Xiaocheng; Wang, Tiefeng								Highly Selective Catalysts for the Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Aldehydes: A Review								ACS CATALYSIS				10	4			2764	2790		10.1021/acscatal.9b04331				FEB 21 2020	2020	The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UAL) to saturated aldehydes (SAL) and unsaturated alcohols (UOL) is an important industrial process for producing fine chemicals. More efforts were made on the selective hydrogenation of C=O to UOL, because C=C hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored over C=O hydrogenation. A crucial step toward high selectivity is the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts. In this Review, the catalyst design for the hydrogenation of UAL to UOL are catalogued into three major strategies, namely, modifying electronic properties, forming electrophilic sites, and involving confinement/steric effect. Research works accomplished in the past decade on the catalyst design for UAL hydrogenation are systematically reviewed using the above strategies. The focus is on the selectivity-enhancing mechanism, methods to perform the chosen strategy, and the factors that influence the mechanism. Density functional theory calculations and catalyst stability are discussed to appreciate the challenges in designing catalysts. In addition, recent advances in the selective hydrogenation of C=C of cinnamaldehyde to hydrocinnamaldehyde are briefly reviewed.									54	1	0	0	1	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400040

In situ X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that cobalt was maintained as CoO under a reaction environment when initial Co3O4 particles on SiO2 were below 8.4 nm. The large metallic Co particles can keep a stable size and phase state, indicating almost unchanged catalytic activity and methane selectivity. In contrast, small metallic Co or CoO particles show a gradual increase in methane selectivity with time on stream. Stable large metallic Co particles can be explained as the dominant surface high-coordinated Co atoms having a weak binding ability for H2O molecules, which are more difficult to be oxidized into CoO. It is believed that CoO rather than metallic Co atoms could interact with Si-OH groups to form inactive cobalt silicate (Co2SiO4), which leads to a higher methane selectivity and drives a decrease in the particle size during the FTS reaction. ZrO2 as a structural promoter highly dispersed on SiO2 was found to give a milder increase in methane selectivity due to fewer chances of Si-OH interacting with CoO species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with CO temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD), NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and Py-IR demonstrate that Co/ZrO2 interfacial sites play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity as the electron accumulation in the interface region not only increases the CO adsorption amount but also promotes the CO dissociation on cobalt sites. At the same time, a higher surface C*/H concentration benefits a lower methane selectivity. ZrO2, which acts as a Lewis acid, can adsorb CO molecules abundantly but weakly by the interaction between Zr4+ cations and O atoms in CO. Especially, for the 15Co(C)/Q15 catalyst with initial CoO particles on SiO2, methane selectivity rapidly increases at an early reaction stage, which originates from easier accessible CoO reacting with Si-OH groups. In addition, both 15Co(C)/Q15 and 15Co(C)/10Zr(I)-Q15 catalysts show the dominant CoO phase, which is active in the FTS reaction. Indeed, the DFT calculations demonstrate that CO activation on the CoO(200) surface via the H-assisted CH2O dissociation pathway exhibits a lower activation energy of 1.21 eV compared to that on the face-centered cubic (fcc) Co(111) surface with an activation energy of 1.42 eV, despite that direct CO dissociation, CHO dissociation, and CHOH dissociation on CoO(200) show higher activation energies. This study provides a prime scientific understanding about regulating catalytic activity and methane selectivity.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400042

The vast majority of studies have been performed in the condensed phase, even though condensed phases introduce complex solvent effects and can promote the leaching of active sites. In response, we have built a custom reactor system to understand H2O2 activation and selective oxidation in the vapor-phase. In this report, we study the epoxidation of cyclohexene with H2O2 over four Lewis-acidic metal oxide catalysts: Ti and Nb grafted on SiO2 and on the Zr based metal-organic framework, NU-1000. The M-SiO2 materials are highly selective to the formation of epoxides and diols, as they can be in the condensed phase, while the NU-1000 based materials are far more prone to overoxidation to CO2, which appears to be connected to their strong reactant adsorption. Apparent activation energies are calculated for all materials when operating in the same kinetic regime, and the heats of cyclohexene adsorption into their pores are then used to directly compare intrinsic enthalpies of activation in the vapor vs condensed phase for the M-SiO2 catalysts. Nb-SiO2 catalysts exhibit similar intrinsic enthalpies of activation in the vapor and condensed phases, whereas the condensed phase transition state in Ti-SiO2 is 24 kJ/mol lower in energy than that of the same material in the vapor phase. These experiments establish another methodology for understanding the various roles of solvent in selective oxidation reactions and studying these reactions under conditions that differ significantly from the thousands of prior studies in the condensed phase.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400043

One important route for the production of DHPS is sulfoglycolytic catabolism of sulfoquinovose (SQ) through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (sulfo-EMP) pathway. SQ is a sulfonated carbohydrate present in plant and cyanobacterial sulfolipids (sulfoquinovosyl diacylglyceride and its metabolites) and is biosynthesized globally at a rate of around 10 billion tons per annum. The final step in the bacterial sulfo-EMP pathway involves reduction of sulfolactaldehyde (SLA) to DHPS, catalyzed by an NADH-dependent SLA reductase. Based on conserved sequence motifs, we assign SLA reductase to the beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (beta-HAD) family, an example of a beta-HAD enzyme that acts on a sulfonic acid substrate, rather than a carboxylic acid. We report crystal structures of the SLA reductase YihU from Escherichia coli K-12 in its apo and cofactor-bound states, as well as a ternary complex YihU center dot NADH center dot DHPS with the cofactor and product bound in the active site. Conformational flexibility observed in these structures, combined with kinetic studies, confirm a sequential mechanism and provide evidence for dynamic domain movements that occur during catalysis. The ternary complex structure reveals a conserved sulfonate pocket in SLA reductase that recognizes the sulfonate oxygens through hydrogen bonding to Asn174, Ser178, and the backbone amide of Arg123, along with an ordered water molecule. This triad of residues distinguishes these enzymes from classical beta-HADs that act on carboxylate substrates. A comparison of YihU crystal structures with close structural homologues within the beta-HAD family highlights key differences in the overall domain organization and identifies a peptide sequence that is predictive of SLA reductase activity.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400044

Surface decoration of nanocatalysts with transition-metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) is an effective strategy to tailor the catalytic selectivity but generally at the expense of activity due to the blocking of active sites. Here, we report that constructing single-site metal oxide modifiers (NiO, CoOx, or FeOx), on supported Au NPs by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can regulate their catalytic selectivity for nitroaromatic hydrogenation. The coverage of single-site metal oxide can be precisely tuned by altering the number of ALD cycles. The Au/TiO2 decorated with five cycles of NiO (Ni: 0.32 wt %) in the style of a single site can efficiently change the product selectivity from azo to azoxy compounds without significantly blocking the surface active sites. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the azoxybenzene bonded to the single-site NiO-decorated Au(111) with a larger adsorption energy, which inhibits the overhydrogenation of azoxybenzene and results in high azoxybenzene selectivity. Our work has demonstrated a general and efficient way to regulate the reaction selectivity of metal nanocatalysts by anchoring single-site metal oxide promoters.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400045

Here, we describe a comprehensive experimental and computational study, which reveals an intricate mechanism of this process. The reaction profile indicated azoarene as the terminal nitrogen intermediate formed from the reduction of nitroarene. The activation of azoarene en route to amidation was probed by kinetics, Hammett plots, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The activation likely involves Ni-catalyzed, ZnCl2-promoted, reductive cleavage of the N=N double bond in an azoarene to form a bridging imido species, which then reacts in a rate-determining step with an ester to give an amide. Besides the nickel catalyst, ZnCl2 has an important influence on the rates and orders of the reaction. DFT computations suggest ZnCl2 stabilizes many of the intermediates in the reaction pathway of azoarene activation, including forming the key Ni-Zn heterobimetallic imido intermediate. The mechanistic insights revealed in this study lay the foundation for the development of synthetic methods employing azoarenes as stable and easily accessible nitrogen sources.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400046

However, plasma must be coupled with appropriate catalysts in order to achieve satisfactory oxygenate selectivities. In this article, the mechanisms underlying plasma-catalytic CO2 + CH4 conversion to three different types of oxygenates (CH3OH, HCHO, and CH3COOH) are discussed along the scales of reaction time (ns to ms) and dimension (nm to mm). Particular emphasis is given to the synergy between plasma-phase and surface reactions. In addition, typical materials (both catalytic and noncatalytic) and experimental setups that can affect the selectivities of oxygenated products are also highlighted.									26	2	0	0	1	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400047

The lytic bond of the subsequent rate-limiting step was very elongated in the X-ray structure (1.61 A), which was proposed to be a consequence of the out-of-plane distortion. Here we use high-level QM and QM/MM calculations to study the intermediate destabilization effect. We show that the intrinsic energy penalty for the observed distortion is small (0.2 kcal.mol(-1)) and that the establishment of a favorable hydrogen bond within X5P-ThDP, instead of enzyme steric strain, was found to be the main cause for the distortion. As the net energetic effect of the distortion is small, the establishment of the internal hydrogen bond (-0.6 kcal.mol(-1)) offsets the associated penalty. This makes the distorted structure more stable than the nondistorted one. Even though the energy contributions determined here are close to the accuracy of the computational methods in estimating penalties for geometric distortions, our data show that the intermediate destabilization effect provides a small contribution to the observed reaction rate and does not represent a catalytic effect that justifies the many orders of magnitude which enzymes accelerate reaction rates. The results help to understand the intrinsic enzymatic machinery behind enzyme's amazing proficiency.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400048	33828899

Benefiting from the facile derivatization of porpholactones, we herein constructed a tunichlorin mimic 6 carrying a beta-hydroxyl group ([mesotetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-2-oxaisobacteriochlorinato] nickel (II)), which exhibits significant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate acceleration of ca. 56-fold compared to its porphyrin analogues. Importantly, in the presence of water, the TOF of 6 is up to 6.1 x 10(4) s(-1) with the lowest overpotential, ranking the best among the catalysts described. Coating catalyst 6 on a Ni foam electrode showed good HER performance in a two-electrode alkaline (1 M KOH) electrolyzer (eta(20) = 540 mV). The functional roles of the beta-hydroxyl group on the acceleration of electron transfer and the formation of the hydrogen bond network with water has been suggested in either chemical or electrochemical reductions and H/D kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), combined with DFT calculations. Interstingly, the DFT model suggested that the formation of the hydrogen bond renders more electron density on the Ni center (rho(Ni) = 0.91) in a one electron reduced intermediate [6(H2O)](-), which helps the stabilization of both one- or two-electron reduced intermediates and dramatically enhances the HER rates.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200054

Unlike the previously reported benzylidene phosphite complexes, the benzylphosphite complexes adopt a cis-dichloro configuration making them latent at ambient temperatures. Irradiation with visible light (420 nm and blue LED) prompts activation of the complexes and induces catalysis of olefin metathesis reactions. One of the complexes, cis-Ru-1, was found to be especially suitable for 3D printing of multilayered polydicyclopentadiene structures with excellent spatial resolutions. Additionally, complex cis-Ru-2 was designed with a chromatic orthogonal "kill switch" based on the 2-nitrobenzyl chemistry, allowing the destruction of the catalyst upon exposure to UV-C light.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200038

Recent reports have shown that Ag can also perform the crucial C-H activation step in several of these functionalizations. However, all of these processes are limited by the wasteful requirement for (super)stoichiometric Ag(I) salts. Herein, we report the development of a Ag/Pd cocatalyzed direct arylation of (fluoroarene) chromium tricarbonyl complexes with bromoarenes. The small organic salt, NMe4OC(CF3)(3), added as a halide abstractor, enables the use of a catalytic amount of Ag, reversing the rapid precipitation of AgBr. We have shown through H/D scrambling and kinetic studies that a (PR3)Ag-alkoxide is responsible for C-H activation, a departure from previous studies with Ag carboxylates. Furthermore, the construction of biaryls directly from the simple arene is achieved via a one-pot chromium tricarbonyl complexation/C-H arylation/decomplexation sequence using (pyrene)Cr(CO)(3) as a Cr(CO)(3) donor.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200045	32201633

In the presence of the bifunctional cyclopentadienone iron tricarbonyl Fe4a-d, the hydrogenation of carbonic derivatives proceeds in good yields with good catalyst productivity. Turnover numbers (TON) of up to 3343, 4234, and 40 for the hydrogenation of CO2, hydrogenocarbonate, and carbonate, respectively, to formate in pure water were achieved.

Detailed mechanistic studies were conducted to assess the feasibility of each elementary step, that is, C(acyl)-N bond oxidative addition, followed by base free transmetallation and reductive elimination. These investigations allowed the structural characterization of palladium(II)-fluoroacyl intermediates derived from C-N bond oxidative addition of an amide electrophile. They also revealed the high reactivity of these intermediates for transmetallation with boronic acids without exogenous base. The mechanistic studies also provided a platform to design a practical catalytic protocol for the synthesis of a diversity of alpha,alpha-difluoroketones, including CF2H-ketones. Finally, the synthetic potential of this fluoroacylation methodology is highlighted in sequential, orthogonal C-Br and C-N bond functionalization of an alpha-bromo-alpha,alpha-difluoroacetamide with a focus on compounds of potential biological relevance.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200055

At present, the prevailing perception is that these serve as both a source of electrons and as a source of Lewis acids that may aid CO2 insertion into the Ni-C bond. Herein, we provide evidence for the in situ formation of organometallic species from the metallic reductant, a step that has either been ruled out or has been unexplored in catalytic carboxylation reactions with metal powder reductants. Specifically, we demonstrate that Zn(O) acts as a reductant and that Zn(II) generates arylzinc species that might play a role in the C(sp(2))-S carboxylation of arylsulfonium salts. Overall, the reductive Ni-catalyzed C(sp(2))-S carboxylation reaction proceeds under mild conditions in a non-amide solvent, displays a wide substrate scope, and can be applied to the formal para C-H carboxylation of arenes.									16	1	0	0	3	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200047

The Pd-N-heterocyclic carbene complex/phosphine/borate systems selectively catalyze the addition polymerization of 5-methylene-2-norbornene and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene with the participation of the endocyclic norbornene double bond, whereas the exocyclic double bond remained intact. The catalysts exhibited extremely high activity and durability: the activity was higher than 1 X 10(8) g(poiymer)/(mol(pd).h) and some catalysts were active at a very high monomer/Pd molar ratio of 2 X 10(7) or at a Pd complex concentration of 5 X 10(-6) mol %. The structure-catalytic activity relationships were established for Pd-N-heterocyclic carbene complexes: the Pd complexes bearing five-membered heterocyclic rings and/or less sterically hindered aryl groups at nitrogen atoms in carbene ligands exhibited the highest activity. The polymerization can be performed in an atmosphere of air and in wet solvents. The resulting polymers are amorphous and high-molecular-weight products consisting of rigid saturated main chains and reactive side groups. Thus, they can be considered as promising intermediates in the production of polymeric materials with high glass-transition temperatures and desired properties by targeted modifications.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200002

The present protocol reveals the potential of the deprotonative phospha-TMM strategy for the synthesis of challenging five-membered carbo- and heterocycles, especially those with spirocyclic entities and quaternary asymmetric stereocenters. The choice of the robust chiral diamidophosphite ligand proved to be very crucial for the desired reactivity in the present transformation.

J	Yang, Guo-Hui; Zheng, Hanliang; Li, Xin; Cheng, Jin-Pei								Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Phosphamides via Atroposelective N-Allylic Alkylation								ACS CATALYSIS				10	3			2324	2333		10.1021/acscatal.9b05443				FEB 7 2020	2020	Axially chiral anilide compounds are an emerging but scarcely investigated class of stereogenic molecules with potential applications as biologically active scaffolds. Because of the lower rotation barriers, the synthesis of these compounds is a challenging task. Furthermore, the status of the limited structure type of chiral anilide constrains the latent capacity of the C-N axis as a chiral source in the application of asymmetric synthesis. Herein, we disclose an efficient protocol for the construction of the rationally designed axially chiral phosphamides via atroposelective N-allylic alkylation reaction of MBH carbonates and phosphamides. The simple hydroquinidine catalyst proves to be most efficient in this artroposelective strategy, delivering the desired axially chiral phosphamides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. In addition, a phosphamide compound, which contains both P-stereogenic center and C-N axial chirality, can be obtained by this method through a kinetic resolution process. Because of the large steric diaryl phosphoryl group, the synthesized axially chiral anilide has a large rotational barrier. As a demonstration, current studied axially chiral ortho-iodine substituted phosphamides could act as efficient chiral hypervalent iodine(III) catalysts for the asymmetric oxidative dearomatization of phenols. Moreover, a speculative model, which can explain the enantiocontrol, was proposed based on the experimental observation and theoretical calculation.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200066

However, the detailed catalytic reaction pathways for PLP-dependent enzymes remain to be explored. Methionine-gamma-lyase (MGL), a promising alternative antitumor agent to conventional chemotherapies whose catalytic mechanism is highly desired for guiding further development of re-engineered enzymes, was used as a representative PLP-dependent enzyme, and the catalytic mechanism for L-Met elimination by MGL was explored at the first-principles quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) level with umbrella sampling. The QM/MM calculations revealed that the enzymatic reaction pathway consists of 4 stages for a total of 19 reaction steps with five intermediates captured in available crystal structures. Furthermore, the more comprehensive role of PLP was revealed. Besides the commonly known role of "electron sink", coenzyme PLP can also assist proton transfer and temporarily store the excess proton generated in some intermediate states by using its hydroxyl group and phosphate group. Thus, PLP participated in most of the 19 steps. This study not only provided a theoretical basis for further development and re-engineering MGL as a potential antitumor agent but also revealed the comprehensive role of PLP which could be used to explore the mechanisms of other PLP-dependent enzymes.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200056	33344000

Herein, we report a distinct photoredox catalytic, visible light mediated neutral radical approach. Selective control of highly reactive acyl radical in the energy barrier surmountable, reversible reaction enables driving the formation of deuterated products when an excess of D2O is employed. The power of the H/D exchange process has been demonstrated for not only aromatic aldehydes but also aliphatic substrates, which have been difficult in transitional metal catalyzed H/D exchange reactions, and for selective late-stage deuterium incorporation into complex structures with uniformly high deuteration level (>90%).									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200059	33623725

Pyrazole, thiophene, furan, and indole underwent exo- and trans-selective annulation. Two strained alkene groups of the resulting products were further manipulated to afford 1-alkylindazoles and ladder polymers. The type of heteroarenes and position of halides along with the choice of ligands and bases were critical to set a preference between C-H annulation and Catellani reactions, which will be useful for the development of Pd-catalyzed, NBE-mediated reactions of heteroarenes.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200013

Single crystalline catalysts based upon the o--alkane complexes [Rh(R2PCH2CH2PR2)(eta(2)eta(2)-NBA)][BAr4F] (R = Cy, Bu-t; NBA = norbornane; Ar-F = 3,S-(CF3)(2)C6H3) are prepared by hydrogenation of a norbornadiene precursor. For the Bu-t-substituted system this results in the loss of long-range order, which can be re-established by addition of 1-butene to the material to form a mixture of [Rh((Bu2PCH2CH2PBu2)-Bu-t-Bu-t)(cis-2-butene)][BAr4F] and [RE((Bu2PCH2CH2PBu2)-Bu-t-Bu-t)(1-butene)][BAr4F], in an order/disorder/order phase change. Deployment under flow-reactor conditions results in very different on-stream stabilities. With R = Cy rapid deactivation (3 h) to the butadiene complex occurs, [Rh(Cy2PCH2CH2PCy2)(butadiene)][BAr4F], which can be reactivated by simple addition of H-2. While the equivalent butadiene complex does not form with R = Bu-t at 298 K and on-stream conversion is retained up to 90 h, deactivation is suggested to occur via loss of crystallinity of the SMOM catalyst. Both systems operate under the industrially relevant conditions of an isobutene co-feed. cis:trans selectivites for 2-butene are biased in favor of cis for the tBu system and are more leveled for Cy.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200034	32296595

Because of the intimate coupling between acidity-relevant enthalpies and temperature-relevant entropies, it has been challenging to locate the optimal reactivity zone for a given reaction. Here, periodic DFT calculations combined with microkinetic modeling were employed to investigate the effect of both acid strength and reaction temperature simultaneously on benzene ethylation reaction in MFI-structured zeolites involving both the concerted and stepwise pathways. The acid strength using the adsorption energy of ammonia as a descriptor was tailored by two strategies of the isomorphic substitution of heteroatoms and the introduction of extra-framework cations. Good scaling relations were established between the enthalpies of involved transition states and intermediates and the descriptor of acid strength. We pioneered the revelation a three-dimensional activity plot varying with the acid strength and reaction temperature. Three regions with diverse kinetic trends and two boundaries signifying the maximum activity were theoretically demonstrated in benzene ethylation. Subsequent kinetic analyses rationalized these intriguing properties and indicated that the rate-limiting step actually changes with the acid strength. The results hold broad implications for understanding Bronsted acid catalyzed reactions and developing robust catalysts in the future.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200001

Herein, we report the kinetics and selectivity of Bronsted acid-catalyzed 1,2-propanediol dehydration in pure water and in aqueous mixtures of the polar aprotic cosolvents gamma-valerolactone, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, tetramethylene sulfoxide, and dimethyl sulfoxide at 433 K. We find that the major product of 1,2-propanediol dehydration is propanal in most mixed-solvent environments with selectivities between 1 and 68 mol %. In contrast, 1,2-propanediol dehydration in aqueous mixtures of dimethyl sulfoxide affords acetone as the major product with up to 48% selectivity with minimal propanal formation. We use classical molecular dynamics simulations to probe these solvent effects by computing the difference between the solvation free energies of 1,2-propanediol and propanal in aqueous mixtures of polar aprotic cosolvents and in pure water. We find that the difference in the solvation free energies is correlated with the rates of propanal formation in all mixed-solvent environments, indicating that the solvent-mediated stabilization of the product state relative to the reactant state translates to increased selectivity toward the same product. Similar agreement between simulated solvation free energies and experimental reaction rates/selectivities is established for the acid-catalyzed dehydration of cis- and trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol and 1,3-cyclohexanediol. Finally, analysis of the solvation environment around 1,2-propanediol shows that dimethyl sulfoxide uniquely competes against water to solvate reactive hydroxyl groups, which causes a change in reaction mechanism in this solvent system that leads to the formation of acetone rather than propanal. These results represent a step toward the computationally efficient screening of solvent systems for acid-catalyzed, liquid-phase processes.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200003

All the aminoacrylate Schiffs base structures in chain A are identical regardless of the substrate used to form them. 4-Hydroxypyridine is also in an identical location, except for F448A TPL, where it is displaced about 1 angstrom due to the increased size of the active site. In chain B, we have found different complexes depending on the substrate. With wild-type TPL, L-tyrosine gave no density, 3-F-L-tyrosine gave a gem-diamine, and L-serine gave a gem-diamine in chain B. S-Ethyl-L-cysteine formed an aminoacrylate in chain B with both wild-type and F448A TPL, but perdeuterated TPL with S-ethyl-L-cysteine formed a gem-diamine of aminoacrylate. The kinetics of aminoacrylate intermediate formation from L-tyrosine and S-ethyl-L-cysteine were followed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry at temperatures from 281 to 320 K and hydrostatic pressures ranging from 1 bar to 1.5 kbar at 293 K. There are large negative values of Delta S+, Delta C-p+, Delta V+, and Delta beta+ for aminoacrylate intermediate formation for L-tyrosine but not for S-ethyl-L-cysteine. Formation of the aminoacrylate intermediates from L-tyrosine and S-ethyl-L-cysteine shows heavy enzyme deuterium kinetic isotope effects with perdeuterated TPL that are strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and may be normal or inverse depending on conditions. These results suggest that conformational dynamics as well as vibrational coupling play a key role in the mechanism of the elimination reaction of L-tyrosine catalyzed by TPL.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200004

Detailed pathways were investigated for two steps: (i) catalyst activation and (ii) ethylene and 1-hexene polymerization. For the catalyst activation step, the C-H activation of Cp-substituents (here, the n-propyl group) has also been studied, which leads to another active site named "metal cyclic active site" in comparison to the conventional active site. Among these sites, the formation of a metal cyclic active site is slower with respect to the conventional active site. Additionally, two different routes have been explored for the catalyst activation, depending on the nature of activators, and observed that [CPh3](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-) is a better activator with respect to B(C6F5)(3). Moreover, complete insertion (primary and secondary) and termination (chain transfer to monomer and beta-H elimination) steps have also been studied for both the active sites. These results suggest that the metal cyclic active site can also produce the ethylene and 1-hexene polymer, which defines the multiple site behavior of metallocene catalysts, which explains the broadening of molecular weight distribution of linear low-density polyethylene-produced metallocene catalysts. Along with hafnocene and zirconocene, the toluene-solvated hafnocene catalyst system has also been investigated for catalyst activation and ethylene polymerization for comparison study. These results indicate that the toluene-solvated hafnocene catalyst system is energetically more facile in comparison to other catalysts. Furthermore, the effect of solvents as well as dispersion interaction on catalyst activation steps has been studied for the (Cp-Pr)(2)M(n-butyl)(2) (M = Hf and Zr) catalyst systems and observed that the dispersion interaction played an important role in the catalyst activation process. In addition to this, the regio- and stereoselective behavior of 1-hexene monomer for the (Cp-Pr)(2)Hf(Me)(2) catalyst has been investigated, and it was found that the metal cyclic active site improves the stereoselective nature of the hafnocene catalyst. Therefore, the current chemical calculations provide insights into the nature of active sites in metallocene catalysts for olefin polymerization.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200005

The CO2 hydrogenation reaction is an ideal model reaction to assess the presented technique due to its high exothermicity. Various dynamic experiments are performed in a newly designed reaction cell with an infrared transmitting ZnSe window. In particular, the gas exchange reactions between CO2 and H-2, the coinjection of the two reactants, and the study of the effect of inert gas addition are investigated. Here, we show that the reaction rate on the surface of a catalyst can be localized in time and space by means of infrared thermography. This opens the way to the precise description of reaction dynamics, in particular for reactions operating in intermitting conditions. Furthermore, we show that the combination of infrared thermography with other analytic techniques such as rapid and quantitative mass spectrometry enables a holistic understanding of the transient reaction phenomena.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200007

While catalysts generally sinter and lose activity after aging at high temperature, here we illustrate that palladium in a core@shell morphology responds very differently. After 800 degrees C aging in oxygen, palladium redisperses into the encapsulating shell. The redispersion is more pronounced, and nearly complete, when palladium is encapsulated by reducible ceria, as opposed to nonreducible silica. This difference is likely due to the availability of lattice oxygen. Through comparisons with polycrystalline ceria nanoparticles, surface decorated with Pd, we show that for favorable restructuring to occur under our simple aging conditions, the process must start from a particular initial configuration, the core@shell. Furthermore, the redispersion of palladium in ceria is accompanied by a change in oxidation state and coordination that inhibits the growth of ceria crystallites in the shell, thereby producing sites that better access the reducibility of the ceria shell support. Together, these effects result in a decrease in the temperature required for 90% conversion (T-90) of carbon monoxide. Our findings demonstrate that thermally induced restructuring of core@shell morphologies under controlled conditions provides a strategy for enhancing low-temperature catalytic activity.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200008

Decarboxylative coupling strategies can be divided into two mechanistic frameworks: decarboxylative homolysis processes that generate radicals and decarboxylative heterolysis processes that generate carbanions. The challenge of both inducing decarboxylation with unmodified substrates and enabling efficient interception by a suitable transition-metal complex has made achieving general approaches to catalytic cross-couplings of carboxylic acids elusive. Thus, more wasteful indirect strategies involving preactivation of the acid unit are more common. This Perspective article highlights recent work in the area of metal-catalyzed ionic decarboxylative cross-coupling reactions of unmodified C(sp(3)) carboxylic acids. In these processes, the carboxylic acid unit serves as a surrogate for nucleophiles normally generated by deprotonation or by the use of organometallic reagents. In many cases, this approach can allow for alkylation reactions under less-basic conditions, improving functional group compatibility, ease of access to starting materials, and inhibit undesirable overfunctionalization of products. Commentary on reaction development, mechanism, and application is provided along with comparisons to related transformations.									27	0	0	0	4	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200009

Numerous efforts have been made to enhance the understanding of the heterogeneous copper-based CO2 reduction mechanisms by computational studies. Here we provide a critical assessment of various proposed scenarios of the initial and post C-C coupling steps that result in either ethylene or ethanol. In silico rationalization of the parameters controlling the product selectivity, such as the catalyst structure and composition (Cu facets, the presence of defective sites and/or subsurface oxygen atoms, or the interplay with a second metal) and the reaction conditions (pH, applied potential, and electrolyte), is provided. A comprehensive scheme combining the proposed pathways is derived, and the issues that are still under debate and require further investigations are highlighted.									71	1	0	0	5	0	72			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200010

For the model reaction, the findings support the corresponding disulfide (PhSSPh) of the arenethiol (PhSH) as the active thiolating source under reaction conditions. Synthesis and reactivity studies along with kinetic measurements support the chemical and kinetic competence of catalytically active well-defined Cu complexes: (phen)Cu-I(O2CC6H4-o-NO2) (2), [(phen)Cu-I(mu-SC6H5)](2) (3), (phen)Cu-I(C6H4-o-NO2) (4), and (phen)Cu-II(O2CC6H4-o-NO2)(2) (5) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline). The presence of an induction period in the stoichiometric reaction of the copper(II) complex (phen)Cu-II(O2CC6H4-o-NO2)(2) (5) with PhSSPh and the absence of an induction period in the analogous stoichiometric reaction of the copper(I) complex (phen)Cu-I(O2CC6H4-o-NO2) (2) suggest that a copper(I) carboxylate is a more likely intermediate than a copper(II) carboxylate. The observation of in situ reduction of Cu-II to Cu-I further supports Cu-I as the primary active catalytic species, and spectroscopic studies also indicate the catalyst resting state to be a Cu-I species. The catalytic reaction exhibits a first-order dependence on [Cu-I] and [2-nitrobenzoic acid] and a zero-order dependence on [PhSSPh] and p(O-2), suggestive of turnover-limiting decarboxylation of a copper(I) carboxylate. Oxygen was found to promote the essential oxidative cleavage of the copper(I) thiolate intermediate [(phen)Cu-I(mu-SC6H5)](2) (3) to regenerate a catalytically active [(phen)Cu-II] (Cu-ox) species with concomitant formation of PhSSPh. On the basis of these findings, a reaction pathway is proposed for the C-S coupling reaction that includes the key Cu-I-based intermediates (phen)Cu-I(O2CC6H4-o-NO2) (2) and (phen)Cu-I(C6H4-o-NO2) (4). The pathway accounts for the role of O-2 in generating the active thiolating source, PhSSPh, as well as enabling catalytic turnover of in situ generated [(phen)Cu-I(mu-SC6H5)](2) (3).									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200011

Herein, we reported efficient heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines over chiral porous polymers integrated with both chiral active sites (VDPEN-RuOTs) and substrate activation sites (TsOH). The porous polymer integrated with TsOH is 10 times more active than that without TsOH in the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline. The volcano curve of TOF with the TsOH/Ru ratio confirms the synergistic catalysis of VDPEN-RuOTs and TsOH. Comparison results with a homogeneous catalytic system imply that the synergy between chiral centers and acidic sites is greatly enhanced in the polymer network. Under optimized conditions, the chiral porous polymer afforded up to 90% ee with 90 h(-1) TOF, which is one of the best solid catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation of quinoline derivatives ever reported. Furthermore, the bifunctional porous polymers realized the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation/reductive amination reaction to obtain benzo-quinolizidines. Our primary results suggest that the incorporation of substrate activation sites near chiral centers is an efficient strategy for the synthesis of high-performance solid catalysts for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200012

Prevention of blocking and deactivation of the reaction resulting from carbonaceous coke formation is a major challenge, with alleviation strategies including exploitation of particle size effects, metal alloying and impurity doping. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the activity, selectivity, specificity, and deactivation of size-selected platinum clusters can be controllably tuned by manipulating the local electronic density of the catalyzing Pt cluster via appropriate choice of the support system. We show that along with interfacial particle-to-support bonding effects, electron transfer and charge balance on the supported subnanometer metal clusters, controlling the catalysts' activity, can be tuned by the local work function of the catalysts' support. Control of this materials property was demonstrated through synthesis of ultrathin amorphous silica, a-SiO2, films on single crystals with differing work functions, Pt(111) or Mo(211), serving as supports for the active subnanometer cluster component. The catalytic control factor introduced here, akin to support doping, allows steering of the chemical catalytic activity and may be used to inhibit undesirable catalyst poisoning and coke formation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200014

Here, we advance the understanding of these critical processes by providing insights into the allosteric mechanism of acid-beta-glucosidase, an enzyme associated with Gaucher disease. Glycosylation, a post-translational modification of proteins, is essential for in vivo catalytic activity and stability of acid-beta-glucosidase. Asparagine 19, a glycosylation site that is located, similar to 30 angstrom from the active site, was observed to be glycosylated with either one or two N-acetyl-glucosamines by X-ray crystallography. In addition, N370S and L444P mutations, located similar to 18 and 30 angstrom, respectively, away from the active site, cause type I Gaucher disease that is common among certain demographic groups. Using multiple microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations, we evaluated the dynamics of the wild-type, glycosylated with one and two N-acetyl-glucosamines at N19 and the N370S and L444P variants of acid-beta-glucosidase. Our results suggest that access to the substrate-binding pocket is controlled by the dynamics of loops surrounding the active site and allosterically regulated. Catalytic residues, E235 and E340, are less localized and sample more conformational states upon glycosylation of acid-beta-glucosidase when compared to the wild-type and N370S variant. Our findings could help explain the allosteric effects of glycosylation on enzyme mechanisms, other disease-causing mutations in acid-beta-glucosidase, and facilitate the design of drugs for the treatment of Gaucher disease.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200015

The challenge for the catalytic oxidation of CH4 is that the catalyst must operate in the exhaust, which contains H2O (5-15 vol %) and SO2 (similar to 1 ppm), and both components cause a severe inhibition of the catalyst. Here, we report that a 2 wt % Rh/ZSM-5 catalyst offers great promise by showing that high methane conversion can be reached at practically achievable conditions and high space velocities also in the presence of H2O and SO2. Rh-based catalysts, which are in the form of Rh2O3 under reaction conditions, become superior to the state-of-the-art Pd-based catalysts in an atmosphere with both H2O and SO2. Although both H2O and SO2 inhibit Pd and Rh catalysts, water is found to have a destabilizing effect on rhodium sulfate that enables a partial decomposition of the sulfate below 400 degrees C. We propose that this partly alleviates the sulfur poisoning of Rh catalysts; wherefore, the combined inhibition from H2O + SO2 is weaker for Rh than that for Pd.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200016

The DFT results indicate that the catalytic cycle is divided into four main processes involving oxidative coupling, insertion, 1,3-alkyl migration, and 1,2-alkyl migration or 1,2-H migration. It is found that a Rh(I) Fischer carbene intermediate, which is derived from the third process 1,3-alkyl migration, selectively determines the formation of the six/five/five tricycle Product 1 or the six/five/four tricycle Product 2, depending on the substitutes on the substrates. The origin of cycloisomerization product selectivity has also been addressed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200017

The promotion of MoS2 by K increases the CO conversion rate and the CH3SH selectivity and is usually linked to the stabilization of the 1T-MoS2 polymorph as compared to the 2H-MoS2 in K-free samples. Sulfided catalysts were characterized using TEM, XPS, and EXAFS. TEM showed that MoS2 particles became larger and more stacked when the K/Mo ratio increased above unity. XPS and EXAFS evidenced the formation of the 1T-MoS2 phase at higher K/Mo ratio in addition to 2H-MoS2. The addition of K to MoS2 led to increased CH3SH productivity due to both increased CO conversion and CH3SH selectivity (T = 300-400 degrees C, P = 10 bar). The performance of the most active catalyst with a K/Mo ratio of 2 was found to be stable, despite the observation that the initially present 1T-MoS2 phase slowly converted to the 2H-MoS2 phase during the reaction at high pressure. There is no correlation between the CH3SH productivity and the amount of 1T-MoS2 in K-promoted MoS2 catalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200018

By employing density functional theory calculations, we investigated the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) activity on binary metal borides, a model system of metal borides. To elaborate the mechanisms, molybdenum borides (Mo2B, alpha-MoB, and MoB2) were first modeled; the results indicate that the crystal structures greatly impact the N-2 adsorption and therefore the electrocatalytic activity. Our electronic structure investigation suggests that boron p-orbital hybrids with dinitrogen pi*-orbital, and the population on p-pi*-orbital determine the N-2 adsorption strength. Therefore, the isolated boron site of Mo2B with less filled p(z)-orbital benefits the activation of N-2 and weaken the triple bond of dinitrogen. This isolated boron sites concept was successfully extended to other metal borides in the form of M2B (M stands for Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ta, W). Mo2B, Fe2B, and Co2B were discovered as the most promising candidates with low limiting potentials due to appropriate adsorption strength of reaction intermediates led by moderate p(z), filling. This work provides insights for designing metal borides as promising eNRR electrocatalysts.									51	3	0	0	0	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200019

Herein, cobalt sulfide (CoSx) nanovesicles decorated with iron sulfide (FeSx) heterophases were successfully synthesized by using a metal-organic framework precursor through a solvothermal method. The obtained CoSx/FeSx exhibited much elevated OER activity as compared to pristine CoSx and even most previously reported cobalt-based electrocatalysts, with the overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. As revealed by operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, the electrocatalytically active species transformation in CoSx nanovesicles could be stimulated by the incorporated FeSx heterophases due to the increased average valence state of cobalt and lowered coordination of cobalt sites. As a result, the electrocatalytically active cobalt oxyhydroxides could be more easily formed on the catalyst surface during OER and thus contributed to the highly improved performance. This real-time spectral and electrochemical insight into the electrocatalytically active species transformation may guide the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting from the viewpoint of electronic structure-electrocatalytic activity relationship.									37	4	0	0	2	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200020

The traditional catalyst of carbon-supported AuCl3 is inclined to be reduced by acetylene and lose its activity during the reaction process. Here, we presented the construction of Au-I-N-3 active sites through single gold atom dispersed on g-C3N4 (Au-1/g-C3N4), which shows robust catalytic performance toward acetylene hydrochlorination. The Au species is shown to have Au' oxidation state, and it is coordinated with three nitrogen atoms of tri-s-triazine repeating units, which is consistent with density functional theory (DFT) modeling and XAFS measurements. Through DFT study, we demonstrate that the Au-I-N-3 sites tend to coordinate with HCl than C2H2 in the initial reaction. The Au-I-N-3 sites cannot be reduced into Au-0 oxidation state easily and thus maintain their activity as stable catalytic active sites. The single-atom-site Au catalyst with nitrogen coordination environment and corresponding electronic state provides an efficient pathway for acetylene hydrochlorination reaction.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200021

In this work, several structures of the dimeric Escherichia coli OPRTase (EcOPRTase) have been determined at high resolution, and kinetic measurements have been carried out to obtain the catalytic rate and Michaelis constants. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out, and structural analysis from the X-ray and MD simulation structures reveals conformational changes related to the flexible catalytic loop that establishes hydrogen bond interactions with the pyrophosphoryl group of PRPP. It is proposed that the OA substrate can be in equilibrium in its tautomeric forms. Starting from the most stable tautomeric form, all the plausible mechanisms have been explored by means of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD simulations using the adaptive string method. The most feasible mechanism consists of the proton transfer from the N1 atom of OA to a water molecule and from the water molecule to the alpha-phosphate O2A atom of PRPP. After that, the nucleophilic attack of the Ni atom of OA to the Cl atom of PRPP proceeds to yield OMP and pyrophosphate. The free energy barrier obtained is in very good agreement with the experimental data reported. Analysis of some relevant distances between key residues and the substrates (OA and PRPP) at the reactant state and transition state (TS) of the rate-limiting step allows us to understand the role of some conserved residues (Lys73, Asp125, Lys103*, Arg99*, and Mg2+ ion) electrostatically stabilizing the TS and preserving the flexible catalytic loop in a closed conformation during the enzymatic reaction.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200022

The NiFe-LDH catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an overpotential of 247 mV and current of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the performance of conventional iridium oxide (IrOx) catalysts. Notably, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis using NiFe-LDH as an anode catalyst exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 74.7% for flowing 1.0 A cm(-2) in 1 M KOH at 80 degrees C.

The Mo2C was modeled by the beta-Mo2C (100) surface, and the Pt/Mo2C interface was modeled by the addition of 12 Pt atoms to the Mo2C (100) surface (12Pt@Mo2C). The potential energy surfaces of the Boudouard reaction were calculated on pure Mo2C, 12Pt@Mo2C, and Pt (111) surfaces. CO dissociation readily occurs on the Mo2C (100) surface, but not on the Pt (111) surface, with the former being exothermic and the latter being endothermic. At the Pt/Mo2C interface, CO dissociation is still exothermic, but with a larger energy barrier. The Boudouard reaction takes place on the Mo2C region, where CO2 is formed from a surface O atom dissociated from one CO molecule in reaction with another CO molecule, leaving one C atom on the surface. C adsorption is preferential on the Pt site in comparison to the Mo site. The supported Pt domains can collect the remaining C atoms, facilitating further CO2 formation on the active Mo sites. A Bader charge analysis shows that the surface metal carbon bond is a mixture of covalent and ionic bonds, whereas the surface metal-oxygen bond is ionic. Electron localization function (ELF) and partial charge density calculations agree well with the Bader charge analysis. These computational results are consistent with experimental observations of the interaction of CO with Mo2C nanotube supported Pt domains in the transient regime under far from equilibrium conditions. The Boudouard reaction is an important side reaction, and the unexpected role found for Pt as a carbon collector, with Mo serving as a disproportionation site, provides a unique vantage point for understanding carbon and coke formation on catalytic materials.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200024

Literature indicates that promoting these particles with sodium and sulfur creates an active Fischer-Tropsch catalyst to produce olefins, while further adding an H-ZSM-5 zeolite is an effective way to obtain aromatics. This research focused on the promotion of iron oxide colloids with sodium and sulfur using an inorganic ligand exchange followed by the attachment to H-ZSM-5 zeolite crystals. The catalyst referred to as FeP/Z, which consists of iron particles with inorganic ligands attached to a H-ZSM-5 catalyst, was compared to an unpromoted Fe/Z catalyst and an Fe/Z-P catalyst, containing the colloidal nanoparticles with organic ligands, promoted after attachment. A low CO conversion was observed on both FeP/Z and Fe/Z-P, originating from an overpromotion effect for both catalysts. However, when both promoted catalysts were washed (FeP/Z-W and Fe/Z P-W) to remove the excess of promoters, the activity was much higher. Fe/Z-P-W simultaneously achieved low selectivity toward methane as part of the promoters were still present after washing, whereas for FeP/ZW the majority of promoters was removed upon washing, which increased the methane selectivity. Moreover, due to the addition of Na+S promoters, the iron nanoparticles in the FeP/Z(-W) catalysts had grown considerably during catalysis, while those in Fe/Z-P(-W) and Fe/Z(-W) remained relatively stable. Lastly, as a large broadening of particle sizes for the used FeP/Z-W was found, where particle sizes had both increased and decreased, Ostwald ripening is suggested for particle growth accelerated by the presence of the promoters.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200026	32064142

We demonstrate that the reductive exsolution of metallic Ru from fluorite-type solid solutions Sm2RuxCe2-xO7 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4) yields catalysts with high activity and remarkable stability for the DRM. The catalysts feature Ru(0) nanoparticles about 1-2 nm in diameter that are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the resulting oxide support. The exsolved material was investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS at Ru, Sm, and Ce K-edges), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. In situ XAS-XRD experiments revealed that the exsolution of metallic ruthenium is accompanied by a rearrangement of the oxygen vacancies within the lattice. The catalysts derived through exsolution outperform (stable over 4 days) the reference catalysts prepared by wetness impregnation and sodium borohydride reduction. The superior performance of the exsolved catalysts is explained by their high resistance to sintering-induced deactivation owing to the stabilizing metal-support interaction in this class of materials. It is also demonstrated that the Ru nanoparticles can undergo redissolution (in air at 700 degrees C)-exsolution cycles.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200027

The amidase activity of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) on two different substrates has been studied by theoretical quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, supported by experimental kinetic measurements. The aim of the study is to understand the substrate promiscuity of CALB in this secondary reaction and the origin of its promiscuous catalytic activity. The computational results predict activation free energies in very good agreement with the kinetic data and confirm that the activity of CALB as an amidase, despite depending on the features of the amide substrate, is dictated by the electrostatic effects of the protein. The protein polarizes and activates the substrate as well as stabilizes the transition state, thus enhancing the rate constant. Our results can provide guides for future designs of biocatalysts based on electrostatic arguments.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200028

However, the catalytic asymmetric hydrofluorination remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we describe a palladium(II)-catalyzed enantioselective hydrofluorination of alkenylarenes, by employing sulfoxide phosphine (SOP) as a chiral ligand, triarylphosphine as a secondary ligand, Selectfluor as a fluorine source, and trihexylsilane as a hydride source. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a range of chiral benzyl fluorides bearing different functional groups are obtained in good yields (up to 80%) with high enantiopurity (having an enantiomeric ratio of up to 94:6). Some mechanistic insight of this reaction is obtained using in situ one-and two-dimensional H-1-P-31 HMBC nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a catalytic cycle is proposed.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200030

We identify three mechanistic scenarios involving one or two catalytically active metal centers in the activation of carbon dioxide and use density functional theory to map out the energy landscape for each of the mechanistic steps. Experimentally determined second-order kinetics in CO2 consumption, the formation of CO and CO32- together with an observed order in catalyst of 0.5 determined by cyclic voltammetry using the Bures normalized timescale method, suggest a turnover-limiting CO32- loss through the scission of a bimetallic species. Faradaic efficiencies for the reduction of CO2 to CO of 86 +/- 4% are observed. Given the reaction mass balance, we estimate a Faradaic efficiency from the conversion of CO2 to CO32- of 93 +/- 4%. Our combined experimental-theoretical approach suggests that two sequential CO2 insertions are followed by a rearrangement to produce carbon monoxide and carbonate from two molecules of CO2 at singly reduced catalyst molecules. The disproportionation reaction reported herein combines the power of catalytic CO2 conversion with sequestration and provides a new chemical avenue for the conversion of carbon dioxide.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200031

Herein, we report the design of metal-free C3B/C3N heterostructure through constructing a p-n heterojunction as a potential direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting by combining first-principles and excited state dynamics simulations. Our calculations show that the strong interlayer interaction in C3B/C3N p-n heterostructure provides a large built-in electric field with about 0.4 V/angstrom and strong interface nonadiabatic coupling which significantly accelerates the recombination of carriers with weak redox capacity (similar to 0.5 ps) and retards the lifetime of carriers with strong redox capacity (similar to 4 ps). Meanwhile, the B atoms, serving as Lewis acid sites, are good catalytic centers to trap water molecules. The hydrogen reduction reaction and complex four-electronic water oxidation reaction can happen smoothly on the C3B and C3N surface, respectively, without additional overpotential and cocatalyst. This work not only provides a potential metal-free direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting, but also paves the way to rational design high-performance direct Z-scheme photocatalysts.									37	4	0	0	3	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200033

However, due to a wide range of possible defect structures formed during material synthesis, the identification and fabrication of precise active sites remain a challenge. Here, we report a graphene edge-based electrocatalyst for two-electron ORR-nanowire-templated three-dimensional fuzzy graphene (NT-3DFG). NT-3DFG exhibits notable efficiency [onset potential of 0.79 +/- 0.01 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], high selectivity (94 +/- 2% H2O2), and tunable ORR activity as a function of graphene edge site density. Using spectroscopic surface characterization and density functional theory calculations, we find that NT-3DFG edge sites are readily functionalized by carbonyl (C=0) and hydroxyl (C-OH) groups under alkaline ORR conditions. Our calculations indicate that multiple functionalized configurations at both armchair and zigzag edges may achieve a local coordination environment that allows selective, two-electron ORR We derive a generalized geometric descriptor based on the local coordination environment that provides activity predictions of graphene surface sites within similar to 0.1 V of computed values. We combine synthesis, spectroscopy, and simulations to improve active site characterization and accelerate carbon-based electrocatalyst discovery.									29	1	0	0	2	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200035

The photochemical single-electron reduction of imine derivatives to generate a-amino radical intermediates has emerged as a powerful umpolung strategy for opening up underexplored routes to such amine motifs. Furthermore, these radicals have been shown to engage in a wide variety of chemistry, including radical-adical coupling, addition to electrophiles, and reductive amination chemistry. The concept has also begun to see application to iminium ion intermediates and the extension to enantiocontrolled C-C bond formation.

However, most defects cannot be purified or their numbers gauged, making them too complex to explore the hidden catalytic mechanism. A twin boundary, with well-defined symmetric structure and high electrocatalytic activity, is an elegant one-dimensional model catalyst in pursuing such studies. Here on polished Cu electrodes, we successfully synthesized a series of copper twin boundaries, whose density ranges from 0 to 10(5) cm(-1). The CH4 turnover frequency on the twin boundary atoms is 3 orders higher than that on the plane atoms, and the local partial current density reaches 1294 mA cm(-2), with an intrinsic Faradaic efficiency of 92%. An intermediate experiment and density functional theory studies confirm the twin boundary's advantage in converting the absorbed CO* into CH4.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200037

Unlike a potentially labile alkenyl thiol, an alkenyl thioester is stable and easy to prepare. Powerful catalysis via a cobalt hydride hydrogen atom transfer and radical-polar crossover mechanism enabled simultaneous cyclization and deprotection. The substrate scope was expanded by extensive optimization of the reaction conditions and tuning of the thioester unit. This is a rare instance of thioesters showing nucleophilic behavior.

Nevertheless, a relatively harsh reaction condition (>380 C, 1.0 MPa) led to producing large amounts of CO2 (>40%) and gave a low olefin/ paraffin (O/P) ratio (<10) as a result of significant promotion of water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and overhydrogenation of olefins. In this context, attempts are made here to develop a highly active low-temperature composite catalyst. It was found that a zinc-cerium-zirconium solid solution (ZnxCe2-yZryO4) and a SAPO-34 mixture showed CO conversion, light olefin selectivity in hydrocarbons, and O/P ratios of about 7%, 83%, and 23, respectively, at 300 degrees C and 1 atm. More interestingly, this catalyst showed CH4 selectivity and CO2 emission lower than 5 and 6%, respectively. A combination of experimental, in situ spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation results reveals that doping Ce in ZnxZr2.0O4 greatly inhibits the WGS reaction by increasing the formation energy barrier of carboxylate intermediate species, but increases surface oxygen vacancy concentration of the composite through formation of a solid solution, and as a consequence, improving the catalytic activity for conversion of syngas at mild conditions by enhancing the interaction of CO with the catalyst, which elongates the C-O bond of the HCO* species.									24	3	0	0	0	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200040

In principle, various chemicals can be sustainably produced through (photo)electrochemical reduction using water as a cheap and clean electron source. However, oxidation of water is a challenging task that results in low energy efficiency and reliability issues for the practical application of power- and solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Here, we show that various biomasses including lignin can be used as alternative electron sources. Electrons can be readily extracted from biomass using phosphomolybdic acid as a catalyst for oxidative depolymerization of biomass and an electron mediator at a much lower potential (0.95 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) than water using best-performing but expensive catalysts (1.5-1.6 V). In particular, value-added chemicals such as CO and vanillin are produced as by-products upon oxidative depolymerization of lignin. As a result, this approach allows efficient (photo)electrochemical production of hydrogen with a Faradaic efficiency close to unity at acidic pHs and brings additional economic benefits from by-products.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200041

The combination of a copper catalyst and chiral NHC ligand was efficient for the generation of enantioenriched secondary alpha-borylorganocopper species via addition of a Cu-Bpin (= pinacol boronic ester) species to alkenyl boramides. Subsequent stereospecific cross-coupling of such organocopper nucleophiles with aryl bromides successfully proceeded with a palladium-XPhos catalyst. Using 1,2-disubstituted borylalkenes containing a 1,8-naphthalenediaminatoboryl (Bdan) group produced the corresponding anti-diborylalkanes as a single diastereomer with good enantioselectivity up to 96.5:3.5 er, and subsequent oxidation generated the corresponding anti-1,2-dihydroxyl compounds.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200042

In this work, a facile co-precipitation method, followed by thermal postsynthetic treatment in N-2/air, was developed to synthesize molybdenum-doped alpha-Mn2O3 materials (Mn2O3:1.72%Mo, Mn2O3:2.64%Mo, Mn2O3:32.23%Mo, and Mn2O3:49.67%Mo) as low-cost water-oxidizing electrocatalysts. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) investigations showed the presence of strong distortions in the molybdenum-doped alpha-Mn2O3 host lattice (Mn2O3:2.64%Mo) and an average oxidation state of Mn-2.84. Several test assays demonstrated that these structural features significantly promote the OER activity. Mn2O3:2.64%Mo was found to exhibit very good activity among the series in cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN)-assisted water oxidation with a maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 585 mu mol O-2 m-(2) h(-1), which is a 15-fold improvement of the pure alpha-Mn2O3 activity and higher than the value of the previously reported benchmark Mn-based catalyst, birnessite. The optimized catalyst (Mn2O3:2.64%Mo) excelled through a low onset potential (300 mV) and a promising overpotential of 570 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is only 20 mV above that of the noble metal benchmark RuO2 electrode and competitive with that of the most active Mn-based OER catalysts reported to date. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies demonstrated that the catalytically active surface area of Mn2O3:2.64%Mo is much higher than that of alpha-Mn2O3 for the OER at the applied potential. In addition, stability during 30 h without degradation was achieved, which exceeds that of a wide range of current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Our study provides a facile and effective approach for the preparation of economical and high-performance manganese-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200043

However, understanding the role of defects, such as oxygen vacancies, in controlling photocatalytic activity remains a challenge. Here, we report the use of chemically triggered fluorogenic probes to study the spatial distribution of active regions in individual tungsten oxide nanowires using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. The nanowires show significant heterogeneity along their lengths for the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals. Through quantitative, coordinate-based colocalization of multiple probe molecules activated by the same nanowires, we demonstrate that the nanoscale regions most active for the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals also possess a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies. Chemical modifications to remove or block access to surface oxygen vacancies, supported by calculations of binding energies of adsorbates to different surface sites on tungsten oxide, show how these defects control catalytic activity at both the ensemble and single-particle levels. These findings reveal that clusters of oxygen vacancies activate surface-adsorbed water molecules toward photo-oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals, a critical intermediate in several photocatalytic reactions.									19	1	0	0	5	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200044

The individual components (nanoparticles, chlorozincate-based Lewis-acid, ionic liquid, support) of the catalytic system are assembled using a molecular approach to bring metal and acid sites in close contact on the support material, allowing the hydrogenation of O-containing heteroaromatic rings while keeping the aromaticity of C6-rings intact. The chlorozincate species were identified to be predominantly [ZnCl4](2-) anions using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and are in close interaction with the metal nanoparticles. The Ru@SILP-[ZnCl4](2-) catalyst exhibited high activity, selectivity, and stability for the catalytic hydrogenation of a variety of substituted benzofurans, providing easy access to biologically relevant dihydrobenzofuran motifs under continuous flow conditions.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200048

Activity, Selectivity, and the Importance of the Pt Atoms Arrangement								ACS CATALYSIS				10	3			2131	2137		10.1021/acscatal.9b04805				FEB 7 2020	2020	Herein we investigated the effect of the adsorption of Bi and Pb on polycrystalline platinum (Pt-p) on the electrooxidation of glycerol (EOG) in alkaline media by combining electrochemical, spectroscopic (in situ FTIR), and analytical (online HPLC) techniques. Besides, we used single crystal Pt electrodes to understand the effect of the modification of Pt-p in terms of the atomic arrangements on its surface. We found that the activity of Pt-p increases in the presence of Pb (Pt-p-Pb), which acts by suppressing the pathways with complete C-C bond breaking (to produce carbonate) and enhancing the production of glycerate, formate, tartronate, and glycolate. We also found that Pt(100) and Pt(111) are affected by the adsorption of both adatoms. However, the modification of Pt(110) explains the results obtained with Pt,. This basal plane is highly activated by Bi and Pb and its behavior is similar to those of Pt-p-Bi and Pt-p-Pb, respectively. These results permit the conclusion that the adatoms acts mainly by activating Pt atoms with low coordination, which generally binds the adsorbates more strongly and, in consequence, suffers more from poisoning. The adatoms act by preventing the formation of multiple bonded intermediates, likely through a combination of a third body effect and also to a change in the electronic configuration at the surface of the catalyst. We propose in this work that the higher promotion of the EOG by the adatoms in alkaline media is due to a stabilization of the negatively charged intermediates by the Coulombic interaction with the positively charged adatoms.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200049

The catalysis was either driven in alkaline solution by a visible light sensitizer or in hydroxide (OH-) containing acetonitrile solution using the one-electron oxidized cubane as the sole source of charge. The mu-peroxido structure of the intermediate was established by O-18 isotopic labeling, and its catalytic relevancy and role in the O-2 evolving cycle were revealed by the kinetic relationship with decreasing cubium ([Co4O4](+)) and recovery of the Co4O4 complex.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200050

As the decarboxylation of fatty acids to alkanes is an important transformation in the production of bio hydrofined diesel (BHD) and jet fuel, we herein report the development of a highly active and reusable Rh nanoparticle catalyst supported by a silicon nanowire array (SiNA-Rh) and its application in the decarboxylation of fatty acids to alkanes under mild conditions. More specifically, SiNA-Rh (500 mol ppm) selectively promoted the hydrogenative decarboxylation reaction at 200 degrees C under microwave irradiation (similar to 40 IAT) in a H-2 atmosphere (10 bar) to afford the corresponding alkanes in high yields selectively. The only coproduct observed was carbon monoxide, an important and essential staple for the chemical industry. Importantly, carbon dioxide formation was not observed. Moreover, the aldehydes were efficiently converted to alkanes by SiNA-Rh, and this catalyst was reused 20 times without any loss in catalytic activity. Finally, to investigate the effects of microwave irradiation on the enhancement of this chemical transformation based on the Si nanorod structures present in the SiNA-Rh catalyst, the effect of the microwave electric field and magnetic field in the microwave to the reaction was experimentally investigated, and the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity around the surface of the Si nanostructure was simulated using the finite element method.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200051

Although many experimental and theoretical efforts have been reported, most of the studies focused on the initial cyclization while the subsequent cascade carbocation rearrangement and deprotonation were ignored, which determine the regio- and stereochemistry of the final product lanosterol associated with the function-related structure domains of cholesterol and its relatives. Herein we continue our previous works on the cyclization (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 8693-8696); the mechanistic details of the remaining part of lanosterol biosynthesis, involving three hydride shifts, two methyl shift and one deprotonation, were investigated by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We obtained the complete free energy profile for lanosterol biosynthesis, which is thermodynamically and kinetically reasonable for the sole formation of the desired product with byproducts effectively avoided. We identified some key factors such as electrostatic interactions and CH center dot center dot center dot pi interactions that facilitate migration of the carbocation. We also identified the direct deprotonation precursor, intermediate I, which has been controversial in previous studies. More importantly, we found that the enzyme mediates the energy transfer from the initial cyclization to the subsequent rearrangements through the electric field of the active pocket, which guarantees the fidelity of the enzyme catalysis.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200052

By combining density functional theory (DFT) with supervised machine learning, we predict the CO and hydrogen (H) adsorption energies of all surface sites on the (1 1 1) surfaces of the disordered CoCuGaNiZn and AgAuCuPdPt HEAs. This allows an optimization for the HEA compositions with increased likelihood for sites with weak hydrogen adsorption to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen and with strong CO adsorption to favor the reduction of CO. As opposed to the construction of specific arrangements of surface atoms, our approach makes the desired surface sites more frequent through an increase in their probability. This leads to the unbiased discovery of several catalyst candidates for which selectivity toward highly reduced carbon compounds is expected and of which some have been verified in the literature.									55	1	0	0	3	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200053

The rutile phase of TiO2 was found to be inactive due to its relatively low reducibility and surface area. The anatase phase, however, was active. Also, a mixture of anatase and rutile, with an excess of rutile, favored the formation of octene isomers during the oxidative activation of alkane. The favorable activity of TiO2 with an excess of the rutile phase was attributed to its enhanced redox properties brought about by the disorder of the TiO2 lattice at the anatase rutile junction.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200057

Generally, their high surface areas, size, shape, porosity, and the possibility of incorporating additional moieties through chemical functional designs are believed to be essential for enriching the catalytic activity of carbon-containing materials. Lately, the new field of single-atom catalysts (SACs) has emerged as the finest alternative for not only homogeneous but also heterogeneous catalysts used in various kinds of catalytic applications. Among a variety of SACs, carbon-based SACs are widely investigated catalysts because of their extraordinary features such as tunable morphologies, ordered porosity, and effortless immobilization through various metals (noble and non-noble), making them highly efficient single-atom catalysts for numerous important catalytic applications. Herein, we intend to report on the progress achieved in researching carbon-based single-atom catalysts, including primarily metals such as Co, Cu, Zn, Pd, Ni, Pt, among others, embedded in carbon matrices and applied to applications in organic catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis. It is important to point out that the main focus of this Review is directed to the activity and applications of single atom catalysts, which are discussed in detail; thus, characterization and rationalization are excluded. Finally, we provide a future perspective on the development and progress made on a carbon-based single metal atom for catalysis.									113	1	0	0	6	0	113			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200060

Recent revolutions made in data science could have a great impact on traditional catalysis research in both industry and academia and could accelerate the development of catalysts. Machine learning (ML), a subfield of data science, can play a central role in this paradigm shift away from the use of traditional approaches. In this review, we present a user's guide for ML that we believe will be helpful for scientists performing research in the field of catalysis and summarize recent progress that has been made in utilizing ML to create homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The focus of the review is on the design, synthesis, and characterization of catalytic materials/compounds as well as their applications to catalyzed processes. The ML technique not only enhances ways to discover catalysts but also serves as a powerful tool to establish a deeper understanding of relationships between the properties of materials/compounds and their catalytic activities, selectivities, and stabilities. This knowledge facilitates the establishment of principles employed to design catalysts and to enhance their efficiencies. Despite such advantages of ML, it is noteworthly that the current ML-assisted development of real catalysts remains in its infancy, mainly because of the complexity of catalysis associated with the fact that catalysis is a time dependent dynamic event. In this review, we discuss how seamless integration of experiment, theory, and data science can be used to accelerate catalyst development and to guide future studies aimed at applications that will impact society's need to produce energy, materials, and chemicals. Moreover, the limitations and difficulties of ML in catalysis research originating from the complex nature of catalysis are discussed in order to make the catalysis community aware of challenges that need to be addressed for effective and practical use of ML in the field.									88	2	0	0	2	0	89			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200061

Calcination of Na6V10O28/SiO2 in air at 600 degrees C leads to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8, interacting with the silica support, and the metastable polymorph of sodium metavanadate, beta-NaVO3. The formation of beta-NaVO3 at this temperature is unexpected as beta-NaVO, supported on silica and calcined at the same conditions transforms into alpha-NaVO3. At 450 degrees C (temperature of the ODP reaction) in an inert atmosphere, Na6V2O28/SiO2 transforms predominantly to the reduced phase alpha'-NaV2O5 that displays poor activity in ODP. However, the deactivated material recovers the high activity of calcined Na6V10O28/SiO2 after ca. 3 h time on stream (TOS) or after 1 h in air (450 degrees C). This observation is consistent with the proposed link between the high catalytic activity in ODP and the reducibility of a V phase as neither the catalytic performance nor characteristic Raman bands of alpha-NaVO3/SiO2 and [VO4]/SiO2 change significantly in an inert atmosphere at 450 degrees C. Vanadium K-edge operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and in situ Raman mapping show that the oxidation of alpha'-NaV2O5 to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8 and beta-NaVO3 occurs under ODP conditions within several minutes. In contrast, the initial activity recovers within hours (depending on the conditions), and it is explained mostly by slow redispersion of the Na1+xV3O8 phase on SiO2.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200064

The steady-state kinetics shows that SCR reactions involving NO2 proceed much more rapidly than those of NO. Data from in situ IR combined with online mass spectrometry under transient conditions demonstrate that Bronsted acid sites (BASs) promote the reaction of NO2 with NH3 to form N-2, H2O, and NH4NO3 at low temperatures (50-150 degrees C). In combination with DFT results, these data suggest that NO promotes the reduction of NH4NO3 to NRINO2, which then decomposes into N-2 and H2O. Therefore, the accumulation of NH4NO3 in the zeolite is inhibited by NO. Furthermore, when NO is absent, NH4NO3 decomposition into N2O and H2O occurs only at high temperatures (>200 degrees C). A comparison of H-AFX and Cu-AFX implies that Cu sites are not active for the reduction of NO2 by NH3 and that BASs are responsible for the NH3-SCR reactions involving NO2.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200067

Several effects, such as strong local electromagnetic fields, increased electron and lattice temperatures, or the transfer of nonthermal charge carriers, could contribute to the reaction rate enhancement. In order to understand plasmon-enhanced catalysis and to enable plasmonic platforms, a distinction between the different underlying effects is required. We investigate the electrochemical model reactions oxidative hydroxide adsorption and glucose oxidation and deconvolve the enhancement processes via their dependence on the excitation wavelength. We observe that nonthermal effects contribute significantly to the plasmonic enhancement.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200068

The state of this automation and the degree to which it may contribute to speeding up development of catalysts are the subject of this Perspective. We also consider the main challenges associated with automated catalyst design, in particular the generation of promising and chemically realistic candidates, the tradeoff between accuracy and cost in estimating the catalytic performance, the opportunities associated with automated generation and use of large amounts of data, and even how to define the objectives of catalyst design. Throughout the Perspective, we take a cross-disciplinary approach and evaluate the potential of methods and experiences from fields other than homogeneous catalysis. Finally, we provide an overview of software packages available for automated in silico design of homogeneous catalysts.									45	0	0	0	4	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200069

However, the integration of colloidal metal NPs and catalyst supports remains challenging. We report a general protocol, antisolvent-induced adsorption, to deposit colloidal metal NPs onto a broad range of catalyst supports with great uniformity. The choice of antisolvent is dependent on the type of ligand and solvent employed in metal NP synthesis. This protocol may provide a bridge between the fields of colloidal science and heterogeneous catalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200070

Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attempted as ODS catalysts. However, the studies found that most of the MOFs were less active in ODS reactions mainly due to the lack of defect sites in the structure. Therefore, the synthesis of MOFs with defect sites has been pursued. Herein, porous titanium terephthalate with rich defect sites can be prepared with the assistance of acetic acid by the solvothermal method. The obtained material exhibited not only extraordinary ODS activity for the removal of DBT (87.1 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) in model oil at room temperature but also simultaneously the strong ability of separating the sulfone product from the oil phase with a total sulfur removal content of 117 mg S/g catalyst when the concentration of 500 ppmw S in model oil was used. Such good catalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the creation of rich defect sites, high surface area, and the exposure of abundant active sites in the structure of the porous titanium terephthalate.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200071

Herein, we report a combined computational and experimental study on the mechanism and catalytic activity of the ylide-substituted phosphine Cy3P-C(Me)PCy2 (keYPhos, L1) in C-N coupling reactions including a comparison with the established and often-applied phosphines (Cy)JohnPhos (L2) and P(tBu)(3) (L3). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with the possible isolation of several intermediates within the catalytic cycle demonstrate that L1 readily forms low-coordinated palladium complexes [such as L1.Pd(dba)], which easily undergo oxidative addition and subsequent amine coordination as well as reductive elimination. Due to the possible opening and closing of the P-C-P angle in L1, the steric bulk can be adjusted to the metal environment so that L1 retains its conformation throughout the whole catalytic cycle, thus leading to fast catalysis at room temperature. Comparative studies of the three ligands with Pd(2)dba(3) as a Pd source show that only L1 efficiently allows for the coupling of aryl chlorides at room temperature. DFT studies suggest that this is mainly due to the reluctance/inability of L2 and L3 to form the catalytically active species under these reaction conditions. In contrast, the YPhos ligand readily forms the prereactive complex and undergoes the first oxidative addition reaction. These observations are confirmed by kinetic studies, which indicate a short induction period for the formation of the catalytically active species of L1, followed by fast catalysis. This behavior of L1 is due to its unique electronic and steric properties, which support low activation barriers and fast catalyst generation.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700008	32030314

The reactions effectively deliver alpha-alkylated ketones and alpha-alkylated N-acyl ketimines, and it is difficult to prepare the latter by other methods in a stereoselective manner. The alpha-alkylated N-acyl ketimine products can be further subjected to chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric reduction with Hantzsch ester to deliver chiral N-acyl-protected alpha-arylated aliphatic amines in high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee, thus providing a method for facile synthesis of chiral alpha-arylated aliphatic amines, which are of importance in medicinal chemistry research. The N-acetyl ketimine product also reacted smoothly with various types of Grignard reagents to afford sterically bulky N-acetyl alpha-tertiary amines in high yields. Theoretical studies in combination with experimental investigation provide understanding of the reaction mechanism with respect to the dual ligand effect and the irradiation effect in the catalytic cycle. The reaction is suggested to proceed via a hybrid alkyl Pd(I)-radical species generated by inner-sphere electron transfer of phosphine-coordinated Pd(0) species with alkyl bromide. This intriguing hybrid alkyl Pd(I)-radical species is elucidated by theoretical calculation to be a triplet species coordinated by three phosphine atoms with a distorted tetrahedral geometry, and spin prohibition rather than metal-to-ligand charge transfer contributes to the kinetic stability of the hybrid alkyl Pd(I)-radical species to impede alkyl recombination to generate Pd(II) alkyl intermediate.									20	0	0	0	8	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700037

An 8-aminoquinoline auxiliary was utilized to increase the reactivity of the alkene and control the regioselectivity via the formation of thermodynamically favored five-membered palladacycle intermediate. 3-Alkene carboxamides bearing a C4-substituted alkene group reacted with a variety of terminal alkynes in the presence of an ortho-phenyl benzoic acid promoter, yielding ?-alkynylated products with high yields and regioselectivity. 3-Butenamide underwent a three-component coupling reaction with internal alkynes and carboxylic acids to give vinyl ester products. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the intramolecular migratory insertion of alkynyl or vinyl palladium species into the C=C bond is responsible for the gamma-selective alkynylation or alkenylation of the alkene group.									22	0	0	0	5	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700003

While Feu dependent enzymes are often oxygen sensitive, variants of this halogenase could be screened in lysates under aerobic conditions. The developed biocatalysts offer a route to mild, late-stage chlorination on milligram scale of non-natural hapalindoles containing a ketone instead of an isonitrile functionality, thereby unlocking them for preparative biocatalysis.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700031

The practicability of this reaction was validated in the straightforward synthesis of axially chiral biaryl monophosphine ligand and demonstrated by a 100-g-scale synthesis.

A variety of relatively large heterocycles 3 featuring a stereogenic trifluoromethylated carbon center, an amino group, as well as an alkenyl and a carbonate moiety were obtained. An X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed a unique 3D architecture of the products that affords an attractive chemical space. Whereas the method can be applicable for nonfluorinated substrates, the trifluoromethyl group plays a vital role in this unexpected Pd-catalyzed nondecarboxylative ring expansion.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700051

Group 6 molecular compounds remain underexplored in this context relative to other transition metals. Here, we present a molecular chromium complex with a 2,2'-bipyridine-based ligand capable of selectively transforming CO2 into CO with phenol as a sacrificial proton donor at turnover frequencies of 5.7 +/- 0.1 s(-1) with a high Faradaic efficiency (96 +/- 8%) and a low overpotential (110 mV). To achieve the reported catalytic activity, the parent Cr(III) species is reduced by two electron equivalents, suggesting an approximate d(5) active species configuration. Although previous results have suggested that low-valent species from the Cr/Mo/W triad are nonprivileged for CO2 reduction in synthetic molecular systems, the results presented here suggest that reactivity analogous to late transition metals is possible with early transition metals.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700019

Unlike the typical P450 enzymes for hydroxylation, CYP121 is believed to behave like a peroxidase and conduct radical-mediated C-C bond formation. Here, we probe whether the phenolic hydrogen of the substrate is the site of the postulated hydrogen atom abstraction for radical formation. We synthesized a singly O-methylated substrate analogue, cYF-4-OMe, and characterized its interaction with CYP121 by ultraviolet-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography. We found that cYF-4-OMe can function as a substrate of CYP121 using the established assay via the peroxide shunt. Analysis of the enzymatic reaction revealed an O-demethylation of cYF-4-OMe instead of cyclization, yielding cYY and formaldehyde. A hydroxylated substrate, cYF-4-OMeOH, is expected to be the intermediate product, which was trapped and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. We further determined that the deformylation reaction of cYF-4-OMeOH proceeds via an alkyl-oxygen rather than aryl-oxygen bond cleavage by the O-18-labeling studies. Finally, the pH dependence catalytic study on the native substrate and the methoxy analogue further supports the mechanistic understanding that the hydrogen atom abstraction is the critical first oxidation step exerted by a heme-based oxidant during the cyclization reaction of cYY. The switch in catalytic activity reveals the power of CYP121 as a P450 enzyme and provides insight into the peroxidase-like catalytic mechanism.									8	1	0	0	3	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700067	32391185

Because the wild-type enzyme is limited to acetic and propionic derivatives as the substrate, variants were designed to extend the substrate scope of this enzyme. By rational protein engineering, the key residue in the active site was identified which can be replaced to allow binding of bulkier acyl moieties.

Here, an important piece of progress is demonstrated for the oxidative coupling of methane. A high-throughput screening instrument is developed for enabling an automatic performance evaluation of 20 catalysts in 216 reaction conditions. This affords an oxidative coupling of methane dataset comprised of 12 708 data points for 59 catalysts in three successive operations. Based on a variety of data visualization analysis, important insights into catalysis and catalyst design are successfully extracted. In particular, the simultaneous optimization of the catalyst and reactor design is found to be essential for improving the C-2 yield.

However, the leaching of active metals (e.g., Co, Rh) during the hydroformylation reaction seriously hinders the development of heterogeneous catalysts. Suppressing metal leaching with the use of an effective protectant is a possible solution to this problem. In this work, Co leaching was suppressed by the addition of suitable protectants (e.g., citric acid, oxalic acid, and formic acid), thus providing a stable heterogeneous catalytic system. In situ Fourier transform infrared proved that toluene and 1-hexene can promote the solvation of Co carbonyls because of the solvent effect. In contrast, formic acid can be converted to formate species (HCOO) on the surface of Co and effectively suppress the formation of Co carbonyls. Theoretical calculations further proved that high CO coverage on the surface of Co leads to the formation of Co carbonyl species. Furthermore, carboxyl radicals resulting from the dissociation of the O-H bonds of organic acids exhibit strong adsorption on the surface of Co. The intrinsic role of the protectants in suppressing metal leaching is attributed to the decreased CO coverage on the surface of Co by competitive adsorption.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700001

However, no direct observation of the impact of the mass transport on the adsorbed CO coverage on Cu, and in turn the CORR activity, has been reported because of the lack of suitable experimental techniques. In this work, we employ operando surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy with and without stirring to investigate the CO binding sites at potentials relevant to the CORR and correlate with reactivity studies. The significant loss in CO peak intensity observed in the spectra at below -0.6 V without stirring highlights the importance of including forced convection in spectroscopic studies to obtain information representative of typical reaction conditions. Despite roughly 1 order of magnitude lower CO coverage on Cu at -0.7 V without stirring, as compared to the case with stirring, the relative distribution of CORR products does not change appreciably, suggesting that adsorbed CO on Cu exists in patches rather than distributing uniformly.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700004

Although it has been reported that the addition of La to Al2O3 results in improved thermal stability to retain high specific surface areas, its effect on the catalytic reduction of NOx (DeNO(x)) has not been studied systematically. Herein, we describe the role of La in La/Al2O3-supported Pd catalysts (Pd/La/Al2O3) for TWC reactions. For that purpose, we employed various in situ spectroscopic studies, including infrared (IR), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The obtained results revealed that Pd-0 species supported on La/Al2O3 are more electron-deficient compared to those on pristine Al2O3 without La(Pd/Al2O3). Kinetic studies using powdered catalysts revealed that the addition of La suppresses the poisoning effect by CO during the DeNO(x) reactions. In addition to the catalytic tests with powdered catalysts, monolithic honeycomb forms of the catalysts were prepared and employed for TWC reactions, which showed that Pd/La/Al2O3 exhibits higher DeNO(x) activity than Pd/Al2O3. In this study, we also reexamined the effective loading amount of La, which has traditionally been similar to 3-5 wt % of La for TWC processes in order to retain the high specific surface area of the La/Al2O3 supports. Our investigations showed that an increased La loading (15 wt %) is even more effective for the DeNO(x) reactions tested in this study due to the higher reactivity toward NO and the greater suppression of the poisoning effect of CO. The developed catalyst Pd/La(15)/Al2O3 has also been tested in a commercial vehicle and has been evaluated on a practical driving mode test cycle (LA-4; city cycle of U.S. Federal and California), where it showed a better catalytic performance than the conventionally used Pd/La(3-5)/Al2O3 catalysts. Our study suggests that the loading amount of La in Pd/La/Al2O3 catalysts needs to be adjusted depending on the application systems, considering not only the support stability (surface areas) but also the promotional effect in the TWC process.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700009

However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in mBiVO(4) have impeded the improvement of its photocatalytic performance and stability. Therefore, important issues are increasingly focused on fine-tuning the physicochemical properties of mBiVO(4) at the atomic level based on facet-engineered surface and interface design to optimize its selectivity and activity. Herein, the review begins with the fundamental aspects of mBiVO(4) semiconductor, including crystal structure, optical properties, electronic structure, and photocatalytic principles. Then the synthetic methods based on surface and interface design that develop to tailor the facet of mBiVO(4), along with the discussion of the mechanisms for facet-dependent photocatalytic performance, are presented. Most importantly, the latest advances in facet engineering that have been performed to regulate the surface of single mBiVO(4) and to design the interface structures that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reaction for mBiVO(4)-based composites are encompassed. Moreover, the photocatalytic application achievements with mBiVO(4) as photocatalysts in energy conversion and environmental remediation are also summarized. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and future research directions for this emerging frontier are discussed.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700010

Late-transition-metal-catalyzed intermolecular couplings of nucleophiles and 1,3-dienes in hydrofunctionalization reactions have quickly emerged as a compelling approach to these and related compounds. In this Perspective, we illustrate how these intermolecular diene hydrofunctionalizations have provided an avenue to complex, highly desirable chemical space that is not readily accessed by other technologies. We also aim to provide some insight into the varying mechanistic pathways and nuances of these myriad reactions to help inform future reaction and catalyst design.									37	2	0	0	13	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700011

However, due to the inertness of N equivalent to N covalent triple bonds, this process remains a huge challenge to achieve a high yield rate of NH3. In this work, we designed an effective approach to promoting N-2 activation by introducing oxygen vacancies into LaCoO3. In N-2 electroreduction, LaCoO3 with oxygen vacancies (denoted as V-o-LaCoO3) exhibited a Faradaic efficiency of 7.6% for NH3 at -0.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Notably, at -0.7 V versus RHE, the yield rate for NH3 of V-o-LaCoO3 reached 182.2 mu g(NH3) mg(cat)(-1). h(-1), which was 2.8 times higher than that (65.3 mu g(NH3) mg(-1) h(-1)) of pristine LaCoO3. To the best of our knowledge, the yield rate for NH3 of V-o-LaCoO3 approaches the activities of the state-of-the-art catalysts toward N-2 electroreduction. Density functional theory calculations revealed that enhanced activation of N-2 over V-o-LaCoO3 originated from the increased charge density around the valence band edge via the introduction of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the analysis of the thermodynamic limiting potentials for N-2 reduction and H-2 evolution demonstrated the higher selectivity for N-2 electroreduction over V-o-LaCoO3 relative to pristine LaCoO3.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700012

However, during the preparation of single-atom catalysts, some metal nanoparticles (NPs) are inevitably generated, which suffer from low selectivity in CO2RR. In this regard, complex postprocessing solution treatments are usually conducted to remove metal NPs using acid. Herein, we fabricated Ni(NC)-based catalysts composed of single Ni atoms and Ni NPs, both of which feature local Ni-N coordination via a simple Ni-metal organic framework (MOF)-assisted strategy. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements, nitrogen species in N-doped carbon have been demonstrated to be coordinated with surface nickel species to form Ni-N motifs, which makes Ni at a low-valent state for efficient CO2RR. Consequently, the catalyst exhibited high performances toward CO2RR with CO Faradic efficiencies (FECO) maintained over 90% from -0.65 to -0.90 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). More importantly, the FECO of 99% could be obtained at a considerable current density (j) of -160 mA cm(-2) in a flow cell configuration. These findings suggest that regulating the surface environment of Ni species can activate the original inert reaction sites into active reaction sites, providing a promising avenue to design high-performance electrocatalysts for CO2RR.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700013

Structure-activity correlations reveal polymorphic changes of the rhombohedral LaNiO3 structure first into cubic LaNiO3 and further into transient oxygen-deficient triclinic LaNiO2.7 and monoclinic LaNiO2.5. These changes occur up to 620 degrees C and already cause considerable DRM activity. Another intermediate structure, the Ruddlesden-Popper phase La2NiO4 with moderate DRM activity, is formed in parallel with the decomposition of monoclinic LaNiO2.5. The decay of La2NiO4 directly goes along with the appearance of crystalline metallic Ni and monoclinic La2O2CO3 and a drastic enhancement of DRM activity. The formation of monoclinic La2O2CO3 and decomposition of La2NiO4 proceed exactly alike up to 670 degrees C with the accumulation of metallic Ni. At 670 degrees C and up to 750 degrees C, monoclinic La2O2CO3 is directly transformed into hexagonal La2O2CO3, and no further Ni exsolution is observed. Only above 750 degrees C, hexagonal La2O3 is observed and apparently formed directly from a drastically accelerated decomposition of monoclinic La2O2CO3 alongside another small increase in metallic Ni. Our direct structure-activity correlation unambiguously shows that the active phase in DRM is a mixture of metallic Ni in contact with monoclinic La2O2CO3. The roles of the latter phase are twofold: acting as the CO2-activated species and stabilizing the metallic Ni particles. Naturally, this implies a perfect carbon removal ability of the metallic Ni/La2O2CO3 interface, which directly relates to an enhanced coking resistance and, most probably, long term stability. Heating LaNiO3 in hydrogen yields a similar sequence of structural transformations with the striking difference of the missing transient La2NiO4 structure, corroborating its crucial role in the formation of the DRM-active Ni/monoclinic La2O2CO3 interface. The final structural fate is a metallic Ni/hexagonal La2O3 phase mixture. Exemplified for the DRM reaction and the initial LaNiO3 structure, only the knowledge about the sheer complexity of the structural dynamics allows the unequivocal assignment of participating structures and phases to their respective catalytic performance, and therefore, allows definite conclusions about the formation and the properties of the final active phase.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700015

Vulcan XC-72-supported Pt(3 wt %)Au(3 wt %)Sn(10 wt %) is used as a reference (PtAuSn/C). For a better understanding of the reaction mechanism, in situ techniques such as electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) are employed. We show that PtAuSn/W2C has a higher electrocatalytic performance than PtAuSn/C, with a CO2 conversion efficiency of 6.5% detected at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at room temperature with on-line quantitative EC-MS measurements. FTIR spectra analysis and EC-MS during the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) show C-C bond breaking at the admission potential (0.05 V-RHE) and an onset potential for the CO2 formation at E >= 0.20 V-RHE. The CO tolerance of Pt nanoparticles in PtAuSn/W2C is improved by the presence of oxide species on W2C through a bifunctional mechanism, as well as the electronic charge transfer from the W2C support to the metallic nanoparticles through an electronic effect.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700016

However, its applicability in the evaluation of multireactant systems is frequently not justified. Here, we derive figures of merit for multireactant enzyme mechanisms based on the stabilization of the transition states and the kinetic Haldane equilibrium relationships. For most bimolecular reactions, the ratio of k(cat)/KiAKB (where K-iA is the dissociation constant of A and K-B is the Michaelis constant of B) is best suited for comparing enzyme performance, especially at nonsaturating reactant concentrations. The value of this parameter for assessing the performance of a series of oxidoreductase mutants is demonstrated. Figures of merit for other common enzymatic mechanisms are derived, which enable a theory-based approach for comparing steady-state catalytic performances of enzymes with multiple reactants.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700017

Here, electronic, geometric, and interfacial phenomena associated with this peculiar effect are investigated. Generating mixed In-Zr oxides by coprecipitation does not improve performance, excluding a primary role of electronic parameters. Because even only 1 mol % of indium stabilizes the metastable tetragonal phase of zirconia, the relevance of its crystalline structure is explored in impregnated solids. Both tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 permit epitaxial growth of In2O3, but a more pronounced lattice mismatching leads to a lower dispersion of the oxide on the second, which is observed in the form of subnanometric islands on the carrier, and to more pronounced tensile forces. The latter triggers the formation of a surplus of oxygen vacancies only in this system, which is in line with its greatly enhanced indium-specific activity. Hence, a deposition synthesis method is essential to unlock the role of monoclinic zirconia. According to kinetic analyses, the monoclinic ZrO2-based catalyst can also better activate both reactants, likely because of a superior character of oxygen vacancies on supported In2O3 and a direct contribution of zirconia to CO2 activation on its own oxygen vacancies, which was investigated in comparison with In2O3 supported on alumina and ceria. Elucidating the nature of the active sites at the phase boundary and the impact of the defect chemistry of zirconia are identified as aspects to be prioritized in upcoming studies to shed further light on interfacial effects in this relevant catalytic system.									47	5	0	0	3	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700018

Nevertheless, its wide applications are always restricted by slow dynamics and limited durability. This paper reports a type of Mn-doped RuO2 nanocrystals for boosting the OER catalytic performance in acidic media. The catalyst (named Mn-RuO2) is prepared through annealing of Ru-exchanged Mn-based derivative at 300 degrees C. Such Mn-RuO2 exhibits excellent acidic OER activity, with an overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a stability of 5000 cycles in the presence of sulfuric acid (0.5 mol/L). Both structural characterization and theoretical analysis show that the Mn doping in RuO2 can tune the d-band center of Ru active sites and lower antibonding surface-adsorbate states, which leads to a decreased free energy of the rate-determining step, ultimately enhancing the intrinsic activity of RuO2.									57	2	0	0	2	0	58			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700020

They catalyze a variety of transformations, including enantioselective intermolecular cyclopropanations. This study is focused on understanding the kinetics of the rhodium-catalyzed cyclopropanation, and this information was used to develop conditions for conducting the reactions with very low catalyst loadings. The enantioselective cyclopropanation of styrenes can be conducted with a catalyst loading of 0.001 mol % and still maintain high levels of enantioselectivity (86-99% ee). A triarylcyclopropanecarboxylate (TPCP) catalyst, Rh-2(p-Ph-TPCP)(4), was the optimum catalyst for maintaining high enantioselectivity with very low catalyst loading.

Accordingly, a facile solvothermal method involving Cu and Pd composition migrations is developed in this study, to synthesize highly uniform and small-sized nanospheres (NSs) possessing the special structures of composition-graded (CG) Cu1Pd1 and surface-doped (SD) Ir-0.03 which are evenly anchored onto N-doped porous graphene (NPG) as a high-performance EOR electrocatalyst ((Cu1Pd1)-Cu-CG/Ir-SD(0.03) NSs/NPG). Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations, electrochemical analyses, and first-principles calculations reveal that, benefiting from the NPG-imparted mass-transfer and oxygen-reduction effects, the CG-SD structural and size morphology effects of the NS, as well as the Cu- and Ir-induced bifunctional, geometric, and ligand effects, (Cu1Pd1)-Cu-CG/Ir-SD(0.03) NSs/NPG exhibits not only ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity and highly efficient noble-metal (NM) utilization, showing 7105 and 6685 mA mg(-1) in Pd- and NM-mass-specific activity (MSA), respectively, which are 15.8 and 14.9 times those of commercial Pd/C, but also satisfactory electrocatalytic durability, retaining respective 28.1- and 19.2-fold enhancements in Pd-MSA compared to the commercial Pd/C, after 1 h chronoamperometric and 500-cycle potential cycling degradation tests. This study not only provides an effective and versatile synthetic strategy to prepare the NM-efficient metal-based nanomaterials with the special CG and SD structures for various electrocatalytic and energy-conversion applications, but also proposes some insights into the composition- and structure-function relations in EOR electrocatalytic mechanism for rationally designing highly active and durable EOR electrocatalysts.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700022

In this research, a simple and high-efficiency hard template method has been successfully developed by adopting carbon nanoparticles obtained from carbonation of polyethylene oxide and urea. The abundant -C-O-C- groups on the surface of carbon nanoparticles provide the high hydrophilicity (from -C-O-C- to -C-O-H) in the alkaline synthetic gel solution, which promotes the synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite and the aluminum condensation in the silica framework to improve the Bronsted acidity. The as-synthesized hierarchical zeolites exhibited two sets of channel systems: micropores (similar to 0.55 nm) are from the MFI framework network, and mesopores (similar to 12.5 and similar to 34.5 nm) result from carbon nanoparticles of 10-40 nm in size, respectively. The hierarchical ZSM-5 with minimized extraframework aluminum species showed catalytic performance with high ethanol conversion (100%) and high stability (lifetime above 30 h) in the ethanol to olefins conversion. Importantly, the diffusion efficiency in ZSM-5 with mesoporous size was remarkably improved, compared to the catalyst with mesoporous size similar to 12.5 nm. As the benzylation of mesitylene with benzyl alcohol, the ZSM-5 (similar to 34.5 nm) sample showed the highest conversion in benzyl alcohol (82.0%) and selectivity in 2-benzyl-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (74.3%).									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700023

Altered PHF8 activity is linked to genetic diseases and cancer; thus, it is an interesting target for epigenetic modulation. We describe the use of combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the mechanism of PHF8, including dioxygen activation, 2OG binding modes, and substrate demethylation steps. A PHF8 crystal structure manifests the 2OG C-1 carboxylate bound to iron in a nonproductive orientation, i.e., trans to His247. A ferryl-oxo intermediate formed by activating dioxygen bound to the vacant site in this complex would be nonproductive, i.e., "off-line" with respect to reaction with NE-methylated K9. We show rearrangement of the "off-line" ferryl-oxo intermediate to a productive "in-line" geometry via a solvent exchange reaction (called "ferryl-flip") is energetically unfavorable. The calculations imply that movement of the 20G C-1 carboxylate prior to dioxygen binding at a five-coordination stage in catalysis proceeds with a low barrier, suggesting that two possible 2OG C-1 carboxylate geometries can coexist at room temperature. We explored alternative mechanisms for hydrogen atom transfer and show that second sphere interactions orient the NE-methylated lysine in a conformation where hydrogen abstraction from a methyl C-H bond is energetically more favorable than hydrogen abstraction from the N-H bond of the protonated NE-methyl group. Using multiple HAT reaction path calculations, we demonstrate the crucial role of conformational flexibility in effective hydrogen transfer. Subsequent hydroxylation occurs through a rebound mechanism, which is energetically preferred compared to desaturation, due to second sphere interactions. The overall mechanistic insights reveal the crucial role of iron-center rearrangement, second sphere interactions, and conformational flexibility in PHF8 catalysis and provide knowledge useful for the design of mechanism-based PHF8 inhibitors.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700024	31976154

Apart from classical rational design and directed evolution approaches, machine learning methods have been increasingly applied to find patterns in data that help predict protein structures, improve enzyme stability, solubility, and function, predict substrate specificity, and guide rational protein design. In this Perspective, we analyze the state of the art in databases and methods used for training and validating predictors in enzyme engineering. We discuss current limitations and challenges which the community is facing and recent advancements in experimental and theoretical methods that have the potential to address those challenges. We also present our view on possible future directions for developing the applications to the design of efficient biocatalysts.									41	4	0	0	22	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700025

The catalytic behavior of these materials is governed by the size and shape of the surface "ensembles" of PGM atoms. Therefore, establishing a means of control over the topological architecture of highly dilute alloy surfaces is crucial to optimizing their catalytic performance. In the present work, we use on-lattice Monte Carlo simulations that are parameterized by density functional theory-derived energetics to investigate the surface aggregation of PGM atoms under vacuum conditions and in the presence of CO. We study several highly dilute alloy surfaces at various PGM loadings, including Pd/Au(1 1 1), Pd/Ag(1 1 1), Pt/Cu(1 1 1), Rh/Cu(1 1 1), Ir/Ag(1 1 1), and Ni/Cu(1 1 1). Under vacuum conditions, we observe a thermodynamic preference for dispersion of PGM as single atoms in the surface of the coinage metal host, on all examined alloy surfaces except Ir/Ag(1 1 1), where Ir atom aggregation and island formation is preferred. By evaluating the alloy surface structure in the presence of CO, we determine that the size and shape of PGM ensembles can be manipulated by tuning the partial pressure of CO (P-CO) on the Pd/Au(1 1 1), Pd/Ag(1 1 1), Ir/Ag(1 1 1), and Ni/Cu(1 1 1) surfaces. In contrast, we determine that Pt/Cu(1 1 1) and Rh/Cu(1 1 1) highly dilute alloys are unresponsive to changes in P-CO with Rh and Pt dispersing as isolated single atoms within the host matrix, irrespective of gaseous composition. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to fine-tune the surface architecture of highly dilute binary alloys for optimized catalytic performance.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700026

For instance, transition metal oxide-based catalysts film has an optimum coating thickness due to the charge transport limitation. In this article, we investigated the charge transport behavior at the interface between the catalysts and the underlying substrate, which has been less investigated than the two other charge-transporting interfaces, that is, the catalysts surfaces and the inner catalysts film. We observed that Mn3O4 nanocatalysts exhibited different oxygen-evolving performances depending on the underlying substrate, and this activity trend was correlated with the work function of the substrate. We analyzed the work function dependency based on the energy band structure at the catalysts substrate interface and determined that the substrates with low work functions formed high Schottky barriers, disturbing the interfacial charge transport. On the basis of this understanding, we demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Mn3O4 nanocatalysts film can be significantly enhanced using industrially important Ti substrates that have a thin buffering interlayer with the proper work function.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700027

After the pioneering studies of Fryzuk, who described the noninnocent behavior of the amine-based aliphatic pincer ligands, and of Milstein, who discovered the dearomative cooperation mechanism in pyridine-based pincer systems, this concept also became prevalent in the context of pincer complexes. Many excellent reviews have dealt with these aspects of heteroatom-based pincer compounds. Nevertheless, this perspective aims to focus on recent developments in the chemistry and catalytic applications of the carbometalated pincer ligands for which noninnocent behavior is rarely observed, and especially those applications incorporating an appended functionality that can interact with the catalytic center. Combining the concepts of robust carbometalated pincer complexes and cooperative mechanisms highlighted by modulation of the secondary coordination sphere provides a "second wind" for this powerful family of organometallic compounds.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700028

In this study, density functional theory calculations were used to reveal the mechanisms of silver- and scandium-catalyzed alkylation of diazo compounds to construct compounds with tertiary or quaternary carbon centers. The results show that, with a silver(I) salt as the catalyst, the reaction starts with carbenation of silver(I) to afford a Fisher-type silver carbene. Nucleophilic addition of silver carbene complex yields an enolate intermediate, which is followed by annulation/retro-aldol reaction to give a dialkylation product. Meanwhile, scandium(III) salt behaves as Lewis acid to generate free carbene, which is followed by conjugate addition of free carbene to produce an enolate intermediate. Subsequent 1,4-proton transfer to a synthesized monoalkylation product is more favorable than nucleophilic addition process. Computational studies show that formation of mono- or dialkylation products from enolate intermediates results from competition between the nucleophilicity and Bronsted basicity of the alpha-carbon in the enolate intermediate, which is mainly controlled by the transition-metal catalyst. The global nucleophilicity and Laplacian of the electron density were evaluated to reveal factors affecting the nucleophilicity and Bronsted basicity.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700029

Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) are two important platform compounds for asymmetric C-C bond formation. In this study, several artificial ATP-free in vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystems were constructed to produce valuable chemicals via facile synthesis of GA3P and DHAP from starch and pyrophosphate. Six cascade enzymes were used for the biotransformation of starch and pyrophosphate to GA3P or DHAP: alpha-glucan phosphorylase (alpha GP), phosphoglucomutase (PGM), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), pyrophosphate phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK), D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FruA), and triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). These two compounds were then used to produce various chemicals, including 2-deoxy-D-ribose (DR) and rare ketoses. After the optimization of reaction conditions, similar to 23.2 mM DR with a product yield of 96.7% and 15.2 mM D-allulose with a product yield of 95.0% were produced, both achieving near-stoichiometric yields through downstream aldol additions and dephosphorylation reactions in one pot. In addition, more than 80% of the product yields of DR and many rare ketoses, such as D-allulose, L-tagatose, D-sorbose, L-fructose, and D-xylulose, from high concentrations of substrates were obtained, showing high industrial potential. This in vitro biomanufacturing platform may provide a promising and cost-effective approach for biomanufacturing value-added chemicals through asymmetric C-C bond formation in the near future.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700030

The integration of this process with methane partial oxidation in a single cell can eliminate or even reverse the electrical power demands of co-electrolysis, while simultaneously producing syngas at industrially attractive H-2/CO ratios. Nevertheless, this system is rather complex and requires catalytically active and coke tolerant electrodes. Here, we report on a low-substitution rhodium-titanate perovskite (La0.43Ca0.32Rh0.06Ti094O3) electrode for the process, capable of exsolving high Rh nanoparticle populations, and assembled in a symmetrical solid oxide cell configuration. By introducing dry methane to the anode compartment, the electricity demands are impressively decreased, even allowing syngas and electricity cogeneration. To provide further insight on the Rh nanoparticles role on methane-to-syngas conversion, we adjusted their size and population by altering the reduction temperature of the perovskite. Our results exemplify how the exsolution concept can be employed to efficiently exploit noble metals for activating low-reactivity greenhouse gases in challenging energy-related applications.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700032

Some of the natural phenomena in which water plays the role of solvent, reactant, or byproduct find parallels in industrially relevant reactions catalyzed by synthetic heterogeneous catalysts. This review addresses different mechanistic features of catalytic reactions influenced by water. They include modification of reactant (or product) solubility and rate of mass transport; stabilization of reactants, products, and transition states, both in open and confined spaces; and direct participation in the catalytic phenomenon by remote bond polarization, H-shuttling, or acting as a cocatalyst.									45	0	0	0	3	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700034

A potential method to avoid this problem is to deposit single-atom catalysts on the nodes so that the products bind in a more favorable monodentate mode. Such catalytic active sites can be characterized with atomic precision, enabling detailed computational mechanistic studies. Thus, we used density functional theory to perform a comprehensive screening of single-atom transition-metal catalysts, in varying oxidation states, deposited on NU-1000 nodes for the gas-phase hydrolysis of the nerve agent sarin. By calculating the complete reaction pathways for M-NU-1000 systems, we discovered that the highest reaction barrier varies between catalysts, highlighting the need to consider more than a single reaction step when screening a large number of diverse materials. The single-metal catalysts are predicted to exhibit lower product desorption energies than unfunctionalized NU-1000. By comparing their relative turnover frequencies using the energetic span model, we identified several catalysts that are predicted to be more active than the parent MOF for this reaction. Finally, we explored periodic trends and molecular descriptors for their effect on catalytic activity.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700035

We, herein, report one facile calcination approach with ammonium chloride and melamine as the template to synthesize nitrogen modified Nb2O5 nanomeshes material (Nb2O5-N), which exhibits a 37-fold reaction rate larger than its commercial counterpart in photocatalytic oxidation of toluene into benzaldehyde under visible light irradiation. The reactivity is ascribed to an extended absorption spectrum within 700 nm by nitrogen modification.

The hydroxyl group was displaced by O-, S-, and N-centered nucleophiles to provide enantioenriched five-membered tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, and tetrahydrothiophene as well as six-membered tetrahydroquinolines and chromanes in up to a 99% yield and 100% enantiospecificity with water as the only byproduct. Mechanistic studies using both experiments and calculations have been performed for substrates generating 5-membered heterocycles. Rate studies show dependences in a catalyst, an internal nucleophile, and an electrophile, however, independence in an external nucleophile, an electrophile, or water. Kinetic isotope effect studies show an inverse KIE of k(H)/k(D) = 0.79. Furthermore, phosphinic acid does not promote S(N)1 reactivity. Computational studies support a bifunctional role of the phosphinic acid in which activation of both nucleofuge and nucleophile occurs in a bridging S(N)2-type transition state. In this transition state, the acidic hydrogen of phosphinic acid protonates the leaving hydroxyl group simultaneously as the oxo group partially deprotonates the nucleophile. Thereby, phosphinic acid promotes the substitution of the nonderivatized hydroxyl group in enantioenriched secondary alcohols by uncharged nucleophiles with conservation of the chirality from the alcohol to the heterocycle.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700038

Herein, we fabricated different Cu-based catalysts with multiple interfaces by facile reduction of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), aimed at controlling the reaction pathway and product selectivity in the hydrogenation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), an important biomass-based platform molecule. These Cu catalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman, TPR, HAADF-STEM, and in situ XAFS. For Cu/MgAlOx, derived from CuMg5Al2-LDHs, Cu particles were partially encapsulated by a MgAlOx support, thus forming highly intimate Cu-MgAlOx interfaces. On Co@Cu/CoAlOx, derived from CuCoxAl2-LDHs, together with a Cu-CoAlOx interface, partially reduced ultrasmall Co clusters were mounted around Cu particles to form a metallic Co-Cu interface, which is tunable by varying the Cu/Co ratio. As expected, Cu/MgAlO, was only active in C=O hydrogenation to produce 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF) in a 92.7% yield, while Co@Cu/3CoAlO(x) sequentially catalyzed the C=O hydrogenation and C-OH hydrogenolysis to yield as high as 98.5% 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), in sharp contrast to Co@Cu/5CoAlO(x), which further broke the C=C bonds of DMF to yield 83.6% 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF). The dependence of the reaction pathway and product selectivity on the composition and properties of the interface was revealed by identifying various intermediates using in situ IR. Specifically, HMF transformed into an O-bound intermediate on the Cu sites over the Cu-MgAlOx, while the unsaturated interfacial Cu-CoAlOx structure served as dual active sites to form a C,O-bound intermediate, thus leading to different products. In addition, the tunable Cu-Co interfacial sites remarkably influenced the adsorption modes of C=C bonds in the furan ring. This work provides a rationale for controlling the reaction pathway and product selectivity for complicated biomass reactions via the controllable construction of multiple interfaces.									28	2	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700039

This report discloses an ethanol synthesis strategy from syngas (CO + H-2) and syngas-derived dimethyl ether (DME) by a tailor-made catalyst with a macroscopic capsule structure. The macroscopically designed capsule catalyst consisted of a millimeter-sized Cu/ZnO core and a micrometer-sized H-Mordenite zeolite shell. The catalyst preparation process further successfully fabricated a zeolite shell, migrated a few Cu from the core, as the promoter of the shell, to significantly improve the catalyst performance. As the methanol byproduct can be easily recycled to DME as a reactant via a simple dehydration reaction, ethanol selectivity can reach 100% theoretically. It is demonstrated that a space-confined-self-regulation mechanism derived from a macroscopic capsule structure serves as a multifunctional switch to manipulate tandem reactions: arranging reaction steps in a favorable order and depressing side reactions simultaneously. These findings will inspire designing a heterogeneous catalyst with multiple functions, shortening the organic or catalytic synthesis route, and also open an avenue to ethanol synthesis from syngas, as DME is also simply produced from syngas.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700040

The accessible mesoporous structures of both the core and shell significantly facilitate mass transfer and catalyst utilization, improving the synergistic catalytic abilities in cascade reactions. The obtained bifunctional nanocatalysts enabled efficient two-step one-pot cascade reactions of different types: dynamic kinetic resolution of primary amines in organic solvent with high yield and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield and 98% ee) and degradation of organophosphate nerve agent in aqueous solution with high rate constant and turnover frequency number values (0.8 min(-1) and 20 min(-1) respectively).									10	1	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700041

Here, the effect of the support on methane combustion was elucidated using Pd nanoparticles supported on various metal oxides (theta-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, MgO, La2O3, TiO2, SnO2, and Nb2O5). To eliminate the effect of Pd particle size and morphology, uniform Pd particles were synthesized in the liquid phase. Interestingly, the methane combustion activity formed a volcano plot when plotted against the oxide formation enthalpy (Delta H-f(M-O)degrees) of the support. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy, the structure of the Pd nanoparticles on the support in an oxidizing atmosphere was identified. Pd particles on theta-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3, ZrO2 and CeO2 with moderate Delta H-f(M-O)degrees adopted a metal-core oxide-shell structure and showed the highest activities for methane combustion. In contrast, completely oxidized Pd particles were present on MgO and La2O3, which have lower Delta H-f(M-O)degrees and were not very active. Pd metal particles on TiO2, SnO2, and Nb2O5 with higher Delta H-f(M-O)degrees were not effective catalysts for methane combustion.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700042

In this study, a record fructose yield of greater than 50% with selectivity exceeding 80% was obtained from glucose concentration of 10 wt % by adopting a 1-butanol/hydrotalcite catalytic system. In this novel process, Mg2+ leaching from hydrotalcite, which is an important issue when utilizing hydrotalcite for glucose isomerization in aqueous solution, was negligible during the reaction. NMR study confirmed that the absence of deuterium at the C-1 position of the fructose product as well as C-2 position of glucose-2-D clearly supports the base-catalyzed deprotonation of the C-2 position in glucose. Also, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the selective formation of fructose from glucose over hydrotalcite surface in 1-butanol than other solvents. Notably, after glucose isomerization, the highly pure glucose (91%) and fructose crystals (95%) were recovered easily from 1-butanol solvent by subsequent cooling and filtration without requiring chromatographic separation. Therefore, the hydrotalcite/1-butanol catalytic system is simple, inexpensive, and a green process for the high-yield fructose production from glucose when compared with current industrial procedures that rely on enzymatic isomerization reactions and chromatographic separations.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700043

Using inexpensive and nontoxic 4-cyanopyridine N-oxide as the cyano shuttle, the methods provide an efficient approach to prepare aryl cyanides and vinyl nitriles under mild and operationally simple reaction conditions with a broad range of functional group tolerances. In hydrocyanation of alkynes, the method demonstrated good regioselectivity, producing predominantly E- or Z-alkenyl nitriles in a controlled manner and exclusively Markovnikov vinyl nitriles when internal diaryl alkynes and terminal alkynes were applied as the substrates, respectively. The preliminary mechanistic investigation indicated that the C-CN bond cleavage process is promoted by oxidative addition to the nickel(I) complex in the cyanation of aryl halides, and further studies via a series of deuterium exchange experiments indicated that water serves as the hydrogen source for the hydrocyanation of alkynes.									28	1	0	0	9	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700044

The utilization of active oxygen species for the direct conversion of methane to value-added products at moderate temperatures was investigated. The active oxygen sites for the selective conversion of methane were identified by a TPR feature at 220 degrees C. This site is also characterized by an infrared band observed at 1872 and 1892 cm(-1) upon adsorption of NO. These bands are NO stretching vibrations of NO adsorbed on iron oxygen monomeric species, present in the zeolite cages and responsible for selective oxidation. We show that these oxidized species react with methane to form oxygenates but at higher temperatures form molecular oxygen. IR bands of surface methoxy groups were observed in significant concentration in the FTIR spectra and are suggested to be intermediate species of the selective oxidation of methane. Studies using continuous reactors demonstrated that cofeeding of methane and N2O-promoted generation of desired products from methane conversion by N2O over Fe-FER catalyst can be enhanced by optimizing the feed ratio of CH4/N2O. Furthermore, N-2, O-2 and NO were detected as the products of N2O decomposition over Fe-FER catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700045

It is demonstrated that the xenon chemical shift, observed in the porous space of Pt-containing alumina pellets, can be used to monitor the temperature changes under rapidly progressing, nonsteady-state conditions during start-up of the catalytic reaction.

The results demonstrated surface-directed selection of the enzyme environment, where amines with lower enzyme-directed incorporation ratio possess higher activation effects, leading to a strategy of self-optimization of the enzyme microenvironment for better catalytic performances.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700047

An alternative to this process, utilizing carbon dioxide and thus potentially mitigating its environmentally harmful emissions, is dry methane reforming (DMR: CH4 + CO2 -> 2CO + 2H(2)). Both of these reactions are structure sensitive, that is, not all atoms in a catalytic metal nanoparticle have the same activity. Mapping this structure sensitivity and understanding its mechanistic workings provides ways to design better, more efficient, and more stable catalysts. Here, we study a range of SiO2-supported Ni nanoparticles with varying particle sizes (1.2-6.0 nm) by operando infrared spectroscopy to determine the active mechanism over Ni (carbide mechanism) and its kinetic dependence on Ni particle size. We establish that Ni particle sizes below 2.5 nm lead to a different structure sensitivity than is expected from and implied in literature. Because of the identification of CHxDx species with isotopically labeled experiments, we show that CH4 activation is not the only rate-limiting step in SMR and DMR. The recombination of C and O or the activation of CO is likely also an important kinetically limiting factor in the production of synthesis gas in DMR, whereas for SMR the desorption of the formed CO becomes more kinetically limiting. Furthermore, we establish the Ni particle size dependence of carbon whisker formation. The optimal Ni particle size both in terms of activity for SMR and DMR, at 500 and 600 degrees C, and 5 bar, was found to be approximately 2-3 nm, whereas carbon whisker formation was found to maximally occur at approximately 4.5 nm for SMR and for DMR increased with increasing particle size. These results have direct practical applications for tuning of activity and selectivity of these reactions, while providing fundamental understanding of their working.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700048

Single-unit-cell Bi2WO6 monolayers, forming a sandwich-like structure, [BiO](+)-[WO4](2-)-[BiO](+), exhibit promising photocatalytic performance and are an ideal system for isolating subsurface defects. We report the single-step synthesis of Bi2WO6 monolayers rich in stable interior W vacancies and characterize their influence on the physical properties necessary for effective photocatalytic surface reactions. Defect-rich monolayers benefit from enhanced visible-light absorption and photocarrier transport, boosting the solar photocatalytic oxidation of benzylic alcohols by 140% at no cost to selectivity or stability. This work highlights the importance of subsurface defects within surface-driven photocatalytic applications and prescribes a general strategy for their isolated study via 2D compounds exhibiting symmetric surface termination.									44	2	0	0	7	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700049

However, it is challenging to achieve high reaction rates while maintaining good selectivity. Here, we used an H-2 bubble-templated electrodeposition method in a thiocyanate (SCN)-containing aqueous electrolyte to synthesize a hierarchically porous Ag nanofoam (AgNF) with curved Ag surfaces modified by SCN. This AgNF demonstrates excellent performance for CO2 reduction with a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97%. It can maintain over 90% FECO in a wide potential window (-0.5 to -1.2 V-RHE), enabling the maximum CO selective current density of 33 mA cm(-2) and the mass activity of 23.5 A g(Ag)(-1), which are the highest values among recently reported Ag-based electrocatalysts. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytic performance of the AgNF correlates with the density of surface SCN ligands, which exhibit excellent electrochemical stability under negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations suggest that SCN ligands promote the formation of COOH* intermediates by modifying the local electron density at the active sites. Further, the synthesis method is applicable to different catalyst substrates. For example, the AgNF grown on a carbon-based gas diffusion film exhibits an ultrahigh mass activity of 52.1 A g(Ag)(-1) and maintains its high CO selectivity simultaneously, demonstrating excellent potentials for practical applications.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700050

In this work, we systematically varied the composition of the metal nodes (Fe2M) of the MOF PCN-250 and used density functional theory (DFT) to identify promising catalysts for light alkane C-H bond activation. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes was studied using N2O as the oxidant to understand the reactivity of the oxocentered Fe2M nodes found in PCN-250, where the Fe ions are in the +3 oxidation state and M is a metal with the oxidation state of +2. We show that the N2O activation barrier is positively correlated with the oxygen-binding energy at the metal center, and the C-H activation barrier is negatively correlated with this same quantity. For clusters containing early transition metals, oxygen binds strongly, facilitating N2O activation but hindering C-H activation. To validate the DFT predictions, we synthesized and tested PCN-250(Fe2M) with M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni and found that PCN-250(Fe2Mn) and PCN-250(Fe-3) are more active than PCN-250(Fe2Co) and PCN-250(Fe2Ni) in agreement with the DFT predictions, demonstrating the power of DFT calculations to predict and identify promising MOF catalysts for alkane C-H bond activation in advance of experiments.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700052

Both the Nicotiana tabacum 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) and Aspergillus terreus aristolochene synthase (ATAS) belong to FPPC, involve the same reaction pathway, and yield their ultimate main product (aristolochene) with different stereochemistries. The catalytic promiscuity of TEAS and fidelity of ATAS have been observed in previous experimental studies, but the detailed catalytic mechanism is still not clear. Herein, by employing the quantum classical multiscale molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, the complete enzyme catalytic pathways from the substrate to aristolochene and various side products (in TEAS) are investigated and the important mechanism insights are included: (1) the PPi moiety (diphosphate group, released from the substrate) would further act as the general acid/base in both TEAS and ATAS enzyme catalysis, which likely plays a general role in FPPC. (2) The Asp444-TyrS20 dyad acts as an additional general acid/base residue pair to increase promiscuity in TEAS. (3) The enriched aromatic residues are essential for the catalytic fidelity of ATAS. Finally, we further discuss the three critical chemical control factors which are proposed to be responsible for the catalytic promiscuity and fidelity in most FPPC, that is, substrate folding mode, intermediate flexibility, and key residue, owing to the more or less plasticity of the active pocket in various FPPC.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700053

However, high process temperatures and the possibility of coke formation require catalyst modifications to mitigate such effects. One of the emerging approaches to prevent platinum catalyst deactivation is the use of boron additives that have been proposed to prevent coking. Despite such a valuable property of boron, the mechanisms for extending the catalyst lifetime and the decrease in coke formation based on this method are still poorly understood. The type and transformations of boron species on silica surface were investigated as a function of boron introduction, platinum addition, catalyst activation, and catalytic reactivity by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations to uncover the possible role of boron modification in improving the catalytic performance. Catalytic nonoxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane revealed that incorporation of boron improved the catalytic activity (similar to 3x) and stability of Pt/SiO2. The role of boron in enhancing catalytic performance was attributed to facilitating the migration of alkyl groups from platinum catalytic centers to tetrahedrally coordinated boron sites.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700055

A suitable conductive scaffold can play a positive role in enhancing the relevant hydrogen evolution performance. Here we demonstrate that three-dimensional NiCoSe2 nanosheet arrays supported on Ni foam are effective as the conductive scaffold for enhancing the catalytic activity of layered MoS1.5Se0.5 particles. The resulting hierarchical MoS1.5Se0.5/NiCoSe2, hybrid electrocatalyst is highly efficient for hydrogen evolution in acid, yielding geometric current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials as low as 57, 88, and 102 mV with good long-term durability at current densities up to 500 mA cm(-2) over 25 h. To the best of our knowledge, no MoS2-based electrocatalyst can realize both low overpotential affording a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) and good durability at a large current density (500 mA cm(-2)) except this report. In particular, the double-layer capacitance, turnover frequency measurements, and high normalized exchange current density indicate its possibly high intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution in acid. It is among the most efficient earth-abundant catalysts exhibiting a low overpotential and simultaneous good intrinsic activity reported on a three-dimensional architecture thus far.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700056

Here, we present a detailed density functional theory (DFT) mechanistic study on this remarkable reaction. Induced by the Lewis base morpholine (or MOR, the amine substrate), Co-2(CO)(8) disproportionates to [Co(CO)(3)(MOR)(2)](+) and [Co(CO)(4)](-). The active catalyst [Co(CO)(4)](-) undergoes an S(N)2 reaction with the alkyl tosylate substrate to form an alkylcobalt(I) carbonyl intermediate with an inverted configuration at the alpha-carbon. The alkylcobalt(I) carbonyl complex favors CO migratory insertion over beta-hydride elimination. The resulting acylcobalt(I) carbonyl intermediate, along with the MOR and CO substrates, could introduce several pathways for the amide C-N bond formation. The inner-sphere pathways involving Co(I)-bound MOR are ruled out. The outer-sphere pathway in which MOR attacks the Co(I)-bound acyl leads to the amide product and the regenerated [Co(CO)(4)](-). The S(N)2 process is the rate-determining step with the largest energy span (Delta G* = 22.8 kcal/mol). The side reaction of double CO insertion faces a higher selectivity-determining energy barrier and hence is less favorable. This DFT work provides deep mechanistic insights into the Co-2(CO)(8)-promoted chemoselective aminocarbonylation of unactivated alkyl electrophiles, thereby having implications for organocobalt catalysis and transition-metal-catalyzed amide C-N bond-forming reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700057

Ni/Al2O3 displayed a high activity for the complete conversion of CO and CO2 to methane and C2+ hydrocarbons. Moreover, over a discrete and relatively narrow temperature range, the net concentration of light C2+ hydrocarbons was elevated, with the exit stream containing a higher concentration of C2+ species than was present in the feed stream and the product stream being virtually free of carbon oxides. It is found that the addition of manganese can enhance the selectivity toward the production of light hydrocarbons. A series of Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared with different Ni/Mn ratios, were studied. Various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, CO and H-2 chemisorption, in situ nitric oxide adsorption Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (NO-FTIR), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were performed to gain an insight into how the addition of Mn to the primary catalyst enhances the yield of light hydrocarbons. The origin of Mn promotion was demonstrated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed the favorable Mn substitution at the Ni(211) step edge sites under reducing conditions. The affinity of these Mn species toward oxidation stabilizes the CO dissociation product and thus provides a thermodynamic driving force that promotes C-O bond cleavage compared to the Mn-unmodified catalyst surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700059		
J	Zhu, Ran; Chatzidimitriou, Anargyros; Liu, Bowei; Kerwood, Deborah J.; Bond, Jesse Q.				Zhu, Ran/AAO-6811-2020				Understanding the Origin of Maleic Anhydride Selectivity during the Oxidative Scission of Levulinic Acid								ACS CATALYSIS				10	2			1555	1565		10.1021/acscatal.9b04289				JAN 17 2020	2020	Biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) is a green platform chemical, and we have previously reported an oxidative scission pathway that selectively transforms it into maleic anhydride (MA). This reaction is curious because it requires oxidative scission of the terminal (methyl) carbon in levulinic acid, whereas gas-phase methyl ketone oxidations are typically selective toward internal (alkyl) bond scission. In order to probe the origin of this disparity, we consider trends observed during the oxidative scission of ketones, keto acids, and keto acid analogues, and we highlight influences of steric hindrances, a-carbon substitution, and the presence of a secondary carboxylic acid functionality. We further consider the role of cyclic intermediates, namely Angelica lactones, in mediating selectivity during the oxidative scission of levulinic acid. Our kinetic analysis is supported by FTIR spectroscopy, which reveals the formation of hydrogen-deficient surface intermediates prior to the onset of oxidative scission. Finally, we pair short-contact-time selectivity analysis with GCMS and NMR spectroscopy to identify a previously undisclosed reaction intermediate-protoanemonin-that forms during the oxidative scission of levulinic acid and a-Angelica lactone. We conclude that facile oxidative dehydrogenation of beta-Angelica lactone to form protoanemonin is the major driving force for the high selectivity toward methyl scission during levulinic acid oxidation. We also note that protoanemonin is an intriguing polyfunctional molecule that appears well-suited to bio-based production, and we have observed that it can be synthesized in yields from 55% to 75% (albeit at low concentration presently) during periods of transient reactor operation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700061

In the present study, the mechanisms and kinetics of methanol oxidation by the aqueous bioinorganic vanadium haloperoxidase (VHPO) enzyme mimic and the heterogeneous solid oxide supported VO4/SiO2 catalyst operating in the gas-solid reaction are compared in order to address the origin of the different reactivities. The molecular level chemical transformations during methanol oxidation by the aqueous VHPO enzyme mimic, possessing the oxo-peroxo O=VO2(-O-C) functionalities, and heterogeneous supported VO4/SiO2 catalysts, containing isolated vanadyl O=V(-O-Si)(3) sites, were monitored with time-resolved in situ vibrational spectroscopy (Raman and IR). Both catalytic reactions proceed via the same methoxy (V-OCH3) reaction intermediate formed upon methanol chemisorption at the bridging V-O-C/V-O-Si bonds. The difference in reactivity is related to the much lower activation energy for breaking the C-H bond of the V-OCH3 intermediate, the rate-determining step, by the highly reactive vanadium peroxo VO2 sites only present for bioinorganic enzyme mimics and absent from heterogeneous catalysts under reaction conditions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700062

Two neighboring Zr-cus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene. They are formed upon reductive catalyst treatment, and their concentration depends on the strength of interaction among CrOx, ZrO2, and support and on the size of ZrO2 crystallites in CrZrOx. SiO2 weakly interacting with CrOx was found to be a more preferable support than Al2O3- or TiO2-based supports. CrOx species promotes formation of Zr-cus sites and improves their intrinsic activity for the desired reaction. CrOx also contributes to coke formation as concluded from operando UV-vis analysis. Cr20Zr80/SiO2 possessing about 3.9 or 2.5 times lower amounts of chromium or zirconium in comparison with an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 or state-of-the-art Ru/LaZrOx revealed about 2 times higher space-time yield of propene at 30% propane conversion at 550 degrees C. Moreover, this catalyst was durable over 50 dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles lasting 150 h.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700063

To this aim, the reaction with olefin of three-member zirconaziridium metallacycles [Cp2Zr-(eta(2)-CH2-N(R)(2))](+)[X](-) [R = C18H37; X- = MeB(C6F5)(3)(-) (1BN) or B(C6F5)(4)(-) (1BT)], models for tight (t-ISIP, 1BN) and loose (l-ISIP, 1BT) inner sphere ion pair (ISIPs), was studied at different levels of concentration and thus self-aggregation. Both 1BN and 1BT undergo a regioselective insertion of a single a-olefin molecule (1-hexene or 2-Me-1-heptene) into the Zr-C bond to form the corresponding five-member metallacycles outer sphere ion pairs (2BN, 2BT, 3BN, and 3BT), with no evidence for further olefin insertions. Under comparable experimental conditions, where monomeric ion pairs dominate (aggregation number N approximate to 1), the apparent rate constant (k(app)) of 1-hexene insertion into 1BT is about 200 times higher than that in 1BN, in agreement with the weaker strength of cation-anion interaction in the former. For 1BT, k(app) is only marginally affected by the self-aggregation level in all investigated experimental conditions. For example, k(app) = 1.1 M-1 s(-1) (N approximate to 1.1) and 1.3 (N approximate to 4.8) for the insertion reaction of 1-hexene in toluene at 223 K and range from 19 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1) (N approximate to 1.5) to 10 x 10(-3) (N approximate to 39) for the insertion of 2-Me-1-heptene in methylcyclohexane at 258 K. On the contrary, k(app) is markedly dependent on self-aggregation in the case of 1BN. For instance, when 1BN is reacted with 1-hexene in methylcyclohexane at 258 K, k(app) increases more than 1 order of magnitude, from 6 x 10(-3) to 93 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1), upon increasing the aggregation level from N approximate to 1 ([1BN] = 6 x 10(-3) M) to N approximate to 4.6 ([1BN] = 12.8 x 10(-3) M). Although the insertion of 1-hexene in 1BN is faster in the slightly more polar solvent toluene (k(app) = 39 x 10(-5) M, N approximate to 1), the relative reactivity difference between ion pairs and larger ionic aggregates is similar in both solvents (about 4X and 3X increment, on passing from N 1.0 to N 1.6, in methylcyclohexane and toluene, respectively). The addition of an inert external salt with a common counterion (2BN) to solution of 1BN dramatically raises the olefin insertion rate constant: at [1BN] = 6 x 10(-5) M, k(app) increases from 6 x 10(-3) M-(1) s(-1), in the absence of 2BN, to 42 x 10(-3), 90 x 10(-3), and 166 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1) in the presence of 1, 3, and 5 equiv of 2BN, respectively. All of the thermodynamic and kinetic data can be rationalized by taking into account the strength of cation-anion interaction in the two kinds of ion pairs. In t-ISIPs, the cation-anion interaction energy is relatively strong, resulting in a relatively small dipole moment and a little thermodynamic tendency to self-aggregate. However, under conditions where homo (or mixed) ion aggregates form, an additional weakening of the cation-anion interaction occurs, causing a substantial increase of the intrinsic reactivity of each t-ISIP within aggregates.On the other side, the cation-anion interaction is already relatively weak in t-ISIPs and ionic aggregates forms much more easily from the thermodynamic point of view; in this case, however, the extra weakening of cation-anion interaction only marginally alters the overall barrier for olefin insertion in each t-ISIP.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700064

Chemo-enzymatic approaches have previously been shown to enable a step economic access to both enantiomers of this alkaloid, but the scalability of these syntheses is limited. Herein, we report a chemo-enzymatic route to dihydropinidine that is dominated by biocatalytic steps and affords the target alkaloid in excellent stereoisomeric purity (>99% ee and de) and high yield (57% overall) on multigram scale. Our synthesis makes use of a solvent-free, Lewis acid-catalyzed Michael addition and a biocatalytic alternative to Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation, achieved by pig liver esterase (PLE)-catalyzed ester hydrolysis and acidification, and specifically developed for this purpose, to access a key intermediate, nonane-2,6-dione. This diketone is then converted into dihydropinidine by a concurrent one-pot (cascade) biotransformation catalyzed by a transaminase, an imine reductase, and an alcohol dehydrogenase. High yields and excellent regio- and stereoselectivities of the individual transformations render chromatographic purification of intermediates unnecessary and make it possible to carry out the entire sequence with a final hydrochloride precipitation of the target alkaloid as the sole purification step.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700065

The accumulation of Li2CO3 leads to battery degradation and results in a short lifespan. Herein, a carbon nanotube supported Ru/NiO@Ni catalyst (Ru/NiO@Ni/CNT) is synthesized with Ru nanoparticles (similar to 2.5 nm) anchored on the surface of core-shell structure NiO@Ni nanoparticles (similar to 17 nm). We found strong interfacial interactions between Ru nanoparticles and NiO. XRD and XPS analysis revealed that the presence of Ru could protect the Ni species from being deeply oxidized while the NiO species could modify the local electronic structure of Ru, inducing a higher oxidation state. When such a Ru/NiO@Ni/CNT catalyst is used as a cathode in Li-(CO2/O-2 (v:v = 4:1) batteries, a long cycling life of 105 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) with an overpotential as low as 1.01 V was achieved, which is significantly better than 75 and 44 cycles with Ru/CNT and NiO@Ni/CNT catalysts, respectively, and confirms the strong synergetic effect between the Ru and NiO species in the electrocatalytic decomposition of Li2CO3. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electrochemical decomposition of Li2CO3 with the assistance of RuO2 indicates that the formation of O-2 is the rate-determining step. In addition, the formation and decomposition process of Li2CO3 was illuminated at a molecular level by in situ FTIR spectroscopy with Ru/NiO@Ni/CNT catalysts.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700068

The size of the gem-dialkyl substituents affects the C-C-C bond angles within the ligands and consequently the P-M-P ligand bite angles. A combination of solid-state X-ray diffraction (XRD) and density functional theory (DFT) studies has shown that an increase in substituent size results in a distortion of the 6-membered metal-ligand chair conformation toward a boat conformation, to avoid bond angle strain. The influence of the gem-dialkyl effect on the catalytic performance of the complexes in palladium-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-octene has been investigated.

Here, we introduce a strategy for arylsilylation of electron deficient terminal alkenes by combining photoredox-catalyzed silyl radical generation, innate reactivity of silyl radical with alkene, and Ni-catalyzed aryl-alkyl cross-coupling. This cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis operates under mild conditions. It employs readily available alkenes, aryl bromides, and silane as reagents, and it produces useful synthetic building blocks in a modular manner.									20	1	0	0	7	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100084

Moreover, many of the cycloalkane units bear multiple substituents and stereocenters. Therefore, synthetic methods that produce polysubstituted aminocyclobutanes and aminocyclopropanes in a highly diastereo- and enantioselective manner are of importance. Herein, we describe the diastereoand enantioselective synthesis of various types of polysubstituted aminocyclobutanes and aminocyclopropanes through CuH-catalyzed hydroamination of 1-substituted cyclobutenes and cyclopropenes. These strained trisubstituted alkenes exhibit much higher reactivity compared to their unstrained analogues in the initial hydrocupration step of the reaction. Moreover, an interesting reversal of regioselectivity was observed in the hydroamination of 1-aryl-substituted cyclobutenes compared to the cyclopropene analogues. The origins of the enhanced reactivity of strained trisubstituted alkenes as well as the differences in the regio- and enantioselectivity between reactions with cyclobutenes and cyclopropenes were investigated computationally.									18	1	1	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100033	33664986

A phenol-substituted multiboron catalyst with a B-C-B structure outperformed simple arylboronic acids in the condensation of alpha-amino acids with suppressed epimerization of electrophiles. gem-diboronic acid catalysis were compatible with various O, N, and S-functionalized alpha-amino acids bearing N-protecting groups including common carbamates used in peptide synthesis (Boc, Cbz, Fmoc). N-trifluoroacetyl protection enabled an unprecedented catalytic dehydrative peptide synthesis at room temperature. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed carboxylate-binding nature of gem-diboronic acids, orthogonal to the activation of carboxylic acids by arylboronic acids. The distinctive reactivity of the gem-diboronic acids would open prospects for mild catalytic peptide condensation.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100073

Notably, the use of aryl-B(dan) in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction provides a complementary solution to the protodeboronation problems. The base KOt-Bu plays a crucial role for the promotion of these cross-coupling reactions as it enables the formation of a borate salt. This reaction protocol was extended to the one-pot sequential Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of 4-[(pin)B]C6H4-B(dan), wherein the "less reactive" aryl-B(dan) moiety was cross-coupled preferentially.									23	0	0	0	4	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100039

Through molybdenum-thiolate cooperation, the B-H bond of. BH3 is cleaved, affording a Mo(II)-H hydride (1H(BH2)) with the BH2 moiety captured at the S-Mo unit. In the presence of NH3, 1H(BH2) smoothly achieves the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitriles.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100043

Guided by the same concept, we have explored two transformations, namely, a Co-catalyzed cyclo-isomerization reaction and a Fe-catalyzed cyclization/Giese addition reaction. Both reactions involve the generation of a versatile alpha-siloxy radical intermediate via concomitant philicity inversion and radical translocation, which is mechanistically distinct from coupling reactions involving fragmentation/reduction pathways. Synthesis of cyclic silyl enol ethers and sterically congested cyclopentanol derivatives have been thus achieved with high regio- and diastereo-selectivity.									9	1	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100055

During the past decade, directing groups have revolutionized molecular synthesis in terms of ortho-selective C-H activation. In sharp contrast, a selectivity switch that guides the typical ortho- to remote meta-C-H activation has thus far proven elusive. Herein, we describe the realization of such a concept for a robust selectivity control in ruthenium catalysis. The distal C-H transformation was guided by key mechanistic insights into the mild, synergistic action of carboxylates and phosphines in ruthenium(II) catalysis. Our findings allowed remote selectivity in broadly effective late-stage diversification of structurally complex drugs and natural product molecules, tolerating sensitive fluorescent dyes, drugs, lipids, peptides, nucleosides, and carbohydrates.									26	0	0	0	5	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100049

By subtle tuning of the reaction conditions, both benzo- and simple five-membered heteroarenes are suitable substrates under similar but different conditions. The key is the right choice of a silver salt. The detailed mechanistic study discloses that the first C-H/C-H cross-coupling step involves an [Ir-II]-[Ir-IV] catalytic cycle, which needs Ag2O as the oxidant. For the second cyclization step, a radical process takes control in the reactions of benzoheteroarenes and Ag2O is required; however, a C-H cyclization functions in the reactions of simple five-membered heteroarenes involving an [Ir-I]-[Ir-III] catalytic cycle, and AgTFA is necessary.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100024

The method selectively produces secondary amines through a hydrogen borrowing mechanism and is successfully applied to several heterocyclic carbinol substrates. Under the reaction conditions, precatalyst 1 evolves through a series of catalytic intermediates: [(eta(6)-cymene)RuH((PyCH2PBu2)-Bu-t)]OTf (3), [Ru3H2Cl2(CO)((PyCH2PBu2)-Bu-t)(2){mu-(C5H3N)(CH2PBu2)-Bu-t}]OTf (4), and a diastereomeric pair of [Ru2HCl(CO)(2)((PyCH2PBu2)-Bu-t)(2)(mu-(O2CPr)-Pr-n)]X (trans-5, X = Cl; cis-6, X = OTf). The structures of 4 and 6 were established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A study of catalytic activity shows that 4 is a dormant (but alive) form of the catalyst, whereas 5 and 6 are the ultimate dead forms. Electrochemical studies show that 4 is redox active and undergoes electrochemically reversible one-electron oxidation at E-1/2 = 0.442 V (vs Fc(+)/Fc) in CH2Cl2 solution. We discuss the factors that govern the formation of 3-6 and the role of selective ruthenium carbonylation, which is essential for enabling generation of the active catalyst. We also connect these discoveries to the identification of conditions for amination of aliphatic alcohols, which eluded us until we understood the catalyst's complex speciation behavior.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100008

In this study, we rationally engineered a functional peroxidase with a catalytic binding site of guaiacol in a model protein, myoglobin (Mb), by replacing Phe46 with a serine (F46S mutation), together with a distal Tyr in the heme pocket (F43Y mutation). The double mutant F43Y/F46S Mb exhibited an overall catalytic efficiency that exceeds most natural peroxidases and is similar to the most efficient horseradish peroxidase. The catalytic substrate binding site was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy, and inhibition studies, as well as molecular docking simulations. Remarkably, this study reports an artificial peroxidase with an engineered catalytic binding site whose structure was solved both in the absence and presence of the substrate.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100096

To reveal how C-O bond coupling reductive elimination (RE) is stimulated by excited Ni-II [Welin, E. R.; Le, C.; Arias-Rotondo, D. M.; McCusker, J. K.; MacMillan, D. W. C. Science 2017, 355, 380], we report here high-level theoretical modellings based on a combined ab initio protocol (CASSCF, CASPT2, DLPNO-CCSD(T)). In contrast to the experimental proposal of the d-d excited state, we find that the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state is most likely to stimulate the C-O coupling RE. This unprecedented assignment of the reactive excited state not only obviates the known thermodynamic prohibition of C-O coupling by ground state Ni-II, but also matches the experimental triplet energy requisite for energy transfer. In addition, the enhanced RE reactivity in excited Ni-II can be well rationalized by the Ni-III character of the MLCT state. The resolution of this intriguing mechanistic puzzle in the excited-state chemistry of a Ni-II complex underscores the potential of multireference methods in this field.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100001

Because its substrate and product are both transient, the mechanistic insight is currently poor. Here, we decipher the catalytic cycle of onion LFS (AcLFS) by employing crystallography, biochemical assays, and molecular simulations. Crystal structures complexed with solute compounds demonstrate not only the properties of the catalytic site but also a potent binding mode of the labile substrate, a mode which can fulfill the "syn-effect" of the reaction. Mutagenesis analyses identified the key residues in the active site, and the kinetic and energetic backgrounds were specified with computational approaches. We present a rational catalytic mechanism based on the intramolecular proton shuttling that is distinct from the canonical [1,4]-sigmatropic rearrangement reaction. Our investigations both in vitro and in silico provide the mechanistic basis explaining how AcLFS generates the lachrymatory agent in nature and provide insights into the molecular machinery concerning organic labile sulfur species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100003		
J	Farhat, Rida; Dhainy, Jihan; Halaoui, Lara I.								OER Catalysis at Activated and Codeposited NiFe-Oxo/Hydroxide Thin Films Is Due to Postdeposition Surface-Fe and Is Not Sustainable without Fe in Solution								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			20	35		10.1021/acscatal.9b02580				JAN 3 2020	2020	This work examines by electrochemical measurements a hypothesis that low-coordination Fe on the surface (surface-Fe) of NiFe-oxo/hydroxide promotes catalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rather than Fe in the bulk structure (bulk-Fe) even in ultrathin films that are mostly surface. The effect of method of incorporation of Fe in Ni-oxo/hydroxide on the electrochemical behavior and OER activity is interrogated, and the sustainability of OER catalysis at NiFe-oxo/hydroxide is examined in the absence of Fe in solution. Ni(Fe)-oxo/hydroxide ultrathin films of a few monolayers and thicker films of tens of monolayers of Ni(OH)(2) were deposited at anodic bias from potassium borate buffer containing Ni nitrate or Ni and Fe nitrates at a 6:4 Ni:Fe ratio and were conditioned and studied in 1 M KOH containing Fe or purified from Fe. Fe was incorporated in NiFe-oxo/hydroxide during codeposition but removed from solution during conditioning and catalysis, was included postdeposition during conditioning and catalysis in Fe-containing solution, or was incorporated postdeposition by conditioning in Fe-containing solution and then removed from solution during catalysis. Ultrathin and thicker NiOxHy and Ni0.6Fe0.4OxHy films exhibited high OER currents and low Tafel slopes in the range of 40 mV/dec in 1 M KOH after activation that included Fe from solution. However, ultrathin and thicker codeposited Ni0.6Fe0.4OxHy films exhibited low OER currents in Fe-purified KOH, which further decreased with the application of anodic bias, and exhibited high Tafel slopes of ca. 100 mV/dec or higher, in a behavior similar to that of NiOxHy in Fe-free KOH. Fe included postdeposition or surface-Fe is therefore indicated to be responsible for high OER catalysis in ultrathin and thicker NiFe-oxo/hydroxide films. The sustainability of OER catalysis at postdeposition activated Ni(Fe)-oxo/hydroxide still required the presence of Fe in solution. NiOxHy films activated for OER postdeposition in Fe-containing electrolyte did not sustain their high OER catalysis in Fe-free KOH but were deactivated with potential cycling. An exchange that causes surface-Fe to move into higher coordination bulk-Fe is proposed to cause the loss of OER activity of activated NiFe-oxo/hydroxide in Fe-free electrolyte.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100004

Co-phosphate-based bifunctional materials can be a plausible option owing to the enhanced stability imparted by the phosphate group. Inspired by the possibility, we report solution combustion synthesized porous Na2CoPO4F as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Comparable to the existing conventional electrocatalysts, porous Na2CoPO4F exhibits robust bifunctional (ORR/OER) properties. Having F-based chemistry, the dissolution is minimal in an aqueous medium, paving a way for its use as a cathode for the aqueous rechargeable hybrid Na-air battery. Thus, based on the bifunctional catalytic performances and stability in an aqueous medium, this material can be envisaged as a cheap and an efficient catalyst for fuel cell as well as a cathode for metal-air batteries.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100006

It necessitates selective and energy-efficient electrocatalysts-a requirement met today only using noble metals such as gold and silver. Here, we show that the two-dimensional sulfur planes in semimetallic titanium disulfide (TiS2) provide an earth-abundant alternative. In situ Fourier transform infrared mechanistic studies reveal that CO2 binds to conductive disulfide planes as intermediate monothiocarbonate. The sulfur-CO2 intermediate state steers the reduction kinetics toward mainly CO. Using TiS2 thin films, we reach cathodic energy efficiencies up to 64% at 5 mA cm(2). We conclude with directions for the further synthesis and study of semimetallic disulfides developing CO-selective electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100009

Central to this advance is the use of the organic-soluble base, potassium trimethylsilanolate, which allows for a homogeneous, anhydrous cross coupling. The coupling proceeds at a rapid rate, often furnishing products in quantitative yield in less than 5 min. By applying this method, a >10-fold decrease in reaction time was observed for three published reactions which required >48 h to reach satisfactory conversion.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100010	33585070

Using in situ spectroelectrochemistry, we present herein a comprehensive discussion on the structural and morphological evolution of MOFs (zeolitic imidazolate framework-67, ZIF-67) during both cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. Dramatic morphological changes exposing electron-accessible Co sites are evident. The intense conversion from tetrahedral Co sites in ZIF-67 to tetrahedral alpha-Co(OH)(2) and octahedral beta-Co(OH)(2), and the formation of their corresponding oxidized forms (CoOOH), is observed during both the electrochemical treatments. Subsequent oxygen evolution reaction suggests the CoOOH produced from alpha/beta-Co(OH)(2) as the dominating active sites, not the metal nodes of ZIF-67. Specifically, the CoOOH from alpha-Co(OH)(2) is most active (turnover frequency = 0.59 s(-1)) compared to that from beta-Co(OH)(2) (0.06 s(-1)). Our study demonstrates the importance of examining the electrochemical stability of MOFs for electrocatalyst design.									65	0	0	0	4	0	65			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100011

Their activities quite depend on the amount of exposed active sites (e.g., Cu-oxide interfaces), which can be tuned by the particle size as well as porosity. Here, we report an active, selective, and stable Cu@ZrOx catalyst with a three-dimensional (3D) porous framework structure via the in situ reconstruction of size-confined Cu@UiO-66. The optimized CU-0.5-300 catalyst shows a high methanol selectivity of 78.8% at a conversion of 13.1% at 260 degrees C, 4.5 MPa, giving a methanol space-time yield of 796 g.kg(cat)(-1).h(-1). It also shows long-term stability for 105 h in a time-on-stream test. Such good performance benefits from abundant Cu-ZrOx interfaces and a stable 3D ZrOx framework. During the reaction, ZrOx species in situ evolves from the unstable Zr-oxide cluster (the building unit of UiO-66) or amorphous ZrO2 to a stable tetragonal ZrO2 phase, but strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) at Cu-ZrOx interfaces retains. The SMSI enables the formation of Cu+ at the ZrO2 surface, which is strongly associated with the active sites for methanol synthesis. In situ diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy studies reveal methanol synthesis which follows a HCOO-intermediated pathway. It is believed that this work provides an "in situ reconstruction" strategy to fabricate a practical Cu@ZrOx framework catalyst for methanol production.									23	3	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100012

In many studies, TiO2 has been successfully used as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction, but there is still a lack of understanding of its catalytic behavior. In this context, CO2 reduction has been studied on nanoporous TiO2 electrodes in acetonitrile media by means of (spectro) electrochemical methods (ATR-IR and UV-vis). Importantly, the onset of the cathodic Faradaic processes related with CO2 reduction on TiO2 electrodes is located at -0.81 V versus SHE, which is less negative than that observed for metal electrodes under similar conditions. UV-vis spectroelectrochemical results indicate that the electrocatalytic behavior of TiO2 is related to the generation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ sites at its surface and promoted by electrolytes with nonintercalating cations in agreement with recent results on WO3 electrodes. ATR-IR spectroelectrochemical measurements allow for monitoring of the TiO2/solution interfacial state as reduction proceeds. Specifically, IR bands for carbon monoxide and carbonyl groups related with carbonate and oxalate are observed. Additionally, a chromatographic analysis shows CO and oxalate as main products. With controlled water addition (0.5 M), methanol and CO were found to be the main products. Based on these results, a mechanism for CO2 reduction on TiO2 electrodes is presented in which the regeneration of the TiO2 surface by oxide electrodissolution/deposition is a critical step.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100013

Catalytic reactions featuring intramolecular C-H amidation of alkyl carboxamide substrates could provide a straightforward disconnection strategy for beta-lactam synthesis. Herein, we report a streamlined method for asymmetric synthesis of beta-aryl beta-lactams from propanoic acid and aryl iodides via Pd-catalyzed sequential C(sp(3))-H functionalization. The lactam-forming reaction provides an example of Pd-II-catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular C(sp(3))-H amidation reaction and proceeds up to 94% ee. The use of a 2-methoxy-5-chlorophenyl iodide oxidant is critical to control the competing reductive elimination pathways of the Pd-IV intermediate to achieve the desired chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that both steric and electronic effects of the unconventional aryl iodide oxidant are responsible for controlling the competing C-N versus C-C reductive elimination pathways of the Pd-IV intermediate.									22	1	0	0	5	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100014

However, many candidate nonprecious metal catalysts bind hydrogen with similar strengths but exhibit orders-of-magnitude lower activity for this reaction. In this study, we employ electronic structure methods that allow fully potential-dependent reaction barriers to be calculated, in order to develop a complete working picture of hydrogen evolution on platinum. Through the resulting ab initio microkinetic models, we assess the mechanistic origins of Pt's high activity. Surprisingly, we find that the G similar to 0 hydrogen atoms are inert in the kinetically relevant region and that the active hydrogen atoms have Delta G's much weaker, similar to that of gold. These on-top hydrogens have particularly low barriers, which we compare to those of gold, explaining the high reaction rates, and the exponential variations in coverage lead directly to Pt's strong kinetic response to the applied potential. This explains the unique reactivity of Pt that is missed by conventional Sabatier analyses and suggests true design criteria for nonprecious alternatives.									59	0	0	0	1	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100015

In this work, N-doped carbon nanotubes were employed to catalyze the oxidation of styrene (SOR) with tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. We observed a significant enhancement of SOR activity caused by the incorporation of nitrogen dopants when the N content was lower than 3.51% but a decline of activity at higher N contents. At N content up to 7.51%, even worse performance than that on N-doped carbon nanotubes with 0.98% N content was observed. This behavior was rationalized by thorough density functional theory calculations. Different catalytic functions of N-P and N-G were revealed. More significantly, a synergistic effect between N-P and N-G was demonstrated when they are quite close, which is unbeneficial for the catalytic activity due to the very high energy barriers. The finding may pave a way to the rational design of high-performance metal-free carbon catalysts.									18	2	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100016

Its activity is substantially altered by aspirin, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that irreversibly inhibits COX-2 by acetylation of its Ser530 residue. So far, it has been widely accepted that in the aspirin-acetylated COX-2, PGG(2) synthesis is blocked, whereas the acetylated enzyme still catalyzes the formation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 15R-HETE as the main product. However, recent experiments detected residual COX activity in recombinant human acetylated COX-2 with formation of prostaglandins, a surprising result that could not be rationalized. In fact, a complete molecular understanding of aspirin action is still lacking, and contradictory explanations have been given for the formation of the highly controlled stereochemical products. We have combined here molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations to study each step of the aspirin-inhibited catalytic mechanism. Our results confirm that 15R-HPETE (then reduced to 15R-HETE) is the main product of the AA oxidation catalyzed by aspirin-acetylated COX-2, being clearly more favorable than the formation of 15S-HPETE. The 15R-HPETE synthesis is kinetically dominant and inhibits the formation of the (9R, 11R) bicyclo endoperoxides to give PGH(2), which can still be obtained as a minor product, as detected experimentally. Instead, the synthesis of isoprostanes does not happen because it is not kinetically competitive at all with the formation of 15R-HETE.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100017

While ketyl radical reactivity of aldehydes by photoredox has been well-established, herein, we have now revealed a pathway for umpolung addition of aldehydes with or without external reductant. Hence, the reductive alkylations and challenging benzylations of nitrogen heteroarenes (i.e., Minisci reactions) are enabled by the bromide-promoted visible light-mediated photocatalysis. The present protocol offers a mild, viable method for late-stage alkylations and transition-metal-free benzylations of biologically active nitrogen-heteroarene molecules. Mechanistic studies are indicative of a bromide-initiated acyl radical mechanism in the absence of external reductant.									42	2	0	0	8	0	42			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100018

In this work, polynitrogen (N-8(-)) deposited on boron-doped graphene (PN-BG) and graphene (PN-G) was synthesized experimentally by a facile cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. It was further used for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which showed superior activity via a four-electron pathway mechanism. BG was prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. Characterizations over BG substrate, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman specstroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, demonstrated that boron atoms were successfully doped into graphene matrix. The formation of polynitrogen (N-8(-)) on BG was confirmed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption. A larger amount of N-8(-) was obtained on boron-doped graphene than that on graphene. Rotating disk electrode measurements indicated that PN-BG showed higher current density than PN-G catalyst because of the larger amount of N-8(-) on BG. Compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst, PN-B1G has much better methanol tolerance. Kinetics study was also carried out to investigate the ORR pathway. Natural bonding orbital analysis confirmed the mechanism. This work provides a facile strategy to modify graphene structure and efficiently stabilize N-8(-) on a graphene-based matrix.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100019

In particular, the SLIR method can also be used to identify single-atom active sites in heterogeneous catalysis.

Despite common structural features in their dinuclear active site, i.e., a thiolate-rich coordination sphere and CO/CN- ligation, the synergetic way, in which the two metal sites act during catalysis, is specific for each enzyme. With the aim of understanding the role of the nature of the metal (Fe vs Ni), we report on a homodinuclear FeFe complex, a parent of a previously reported NiFe complex, to compare their electrocatalytic activity for H-2 production. The di-iron complex [(CO)-(LFeII)-Fe-N2S2-Fe-II (CO)Cpr (with L-N2S2 = 2,2'-(2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-diyObis(1,1-diphenylethanethiolate and Cp = cyclopentadienyl) has been synthesized and fully characterized. In the solid state, it contains two CO ligands: one bound to the {FeCp} moiety in a semibridging manner and one terminally bound to the {FeLN2S2} moiety. This dinuclear iron complex is thus not isostructural to [(LNiFeII)-Ni-N2S2-Fe-II(CO)Cp](+), which contains a single CO ligand terminally bound to the Fe site. However, at low concentrations in MeCN solutions, the CO ligand coordinated to the {FeLN2S2} moiety is removed and the CO ligand bound to the {FeCp} moiety becomes fully bridging between the two Fe sites. Under such conditions, the di-iron complex displays similar catalytic performances to the parent NiFe complex (a comparable overpotential, i = 730 and 690 mV, and TON = 15 and 16, respectively). Cyclic voltammetry data give direct experimental evidence for an E[ECEC] mechanism, which was also previously proposed for the NiFe complex. However, the structure of the one-electron reduced species, the entry point of the catalytic cycle, slightly differs for the two systems: in [(LNiI)-Ni-N2S2 (CO)(FeCp)-Cp-II], this is valence localized species on the site Ni and the CO ligand bridges the two metal ions, while in [(CO)L(N2S2F)eFeCp], this is a type II-III mixed-valence species with the CO terminally bound to the {FeLN2S2} unit.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100021

We recently demonstrated that certain flavins (FLs) are potent redox photo-catalysts capable of converting Pt-IV anticancer prodrug complexes into Pt-II drugs in the biological environment. Herein, we investigate the mechanism of these artificial photocatalytic reactions employing four different free flavins, namely, riboflavin (Rf), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), tetra-O-acetyl riboflavin (TARF) and lumiflavin (Lf), and the flavoprotein miniSOG (mini Singlet Oxygen Generator), together with a panel of Pt-IV substrates conveniently selected. NMR, steady-state, and time-resolved optical spectroscopy studies highlight that light activation of FLs in the presence of NADH as electron donor (pH 7-7.5) eventually leads to the generation of the reduced FLH- species which catalyzes the Pt-IV-to-Pt-II conversion with turnover frequency (TOF) values ranging between 1.3 and 30 min(-1) and turnover number (TON) values reaching 500. Comparable catalytic efficiency is also found for reactions performed in cell culture medium. Density functional theory suggests that activation via reduction of the Pt-IV complexes may be influenced by H-bonding interactions between the FL catalyst and the metal substrate and confirms that both the isoalloxazine and ribityl moieties of the FLs determine the catalytic efficiency of the process. The FMN-containing miniSOG is a less effective catalyst (TOFs < 5.6 min(-1)) because the formation of the doubly reduced FMNH- competes with an electron transfer reaction involving the protein matrix which quenches the FMN excited state to give a singly reduced FMN center dot-.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100022

This simple strategy features wide functional group tolerance, good reproducibility, and preparative scale utility. The manganese catalyst plays a crucial role in this C-H activation protocol, enabling high selectivity with previously challenging internal alkynes. Furthermore, the synthetic value of the method is highlighted by diverse postsynthesis functionalizations of the final products.									31	0	0	0	6	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100023

However, the rational design of photocatalysts is often hampered by the mechanistic complexity and low modularity of the catalyst structure. Herein, we demonstrate a photophysical study of diverging photocatalytic pathways that guides the design of organic acridinium catalysts to complement polypyridyl transition metal systems. A combined halogen metal exchange/directed ortho-metalation provides reagents for a broad range of modular acridinium catalysts with fine-tuned photophysical and photochemical properties such as excited-state lifetimes, redox potentials, and photostabilities poised to refine organocatalytic photoredox methodology.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100025

We describe herein the development of the reaction, exploration of the substrate scope, and studies on the reaction mechanism. The intramolecular coupling reaction leads to the formation of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanones with a quaternary carbon bridgehead in synthetically useful yields (up to 98%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 er) and good functional group tolerance (>30 examples). Significantly, aryl and alkenyl bromides as well as less reactive triflates are all compatible substrates for this process. The synthetic versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by scale-up synthesis and diverse transformations of the products into valuable building blocks, including quaternary center-containing dihydronaphthalenes, ring-fused indoles and lactones, tetralones, and 6,6,5-tricycles. Mechanistic studies by computational calculations provide insights into the role of benzylamine in accelerating the reaction rate and enhancing the enantioselectivities.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100026

Though these advances in performance have been important for demonstrating the feasibility of the technology, nearly all AEMFCs reported in the literature have required a relatively high loading of platinum group metal (PGM)-based catalysts at both the anode and cathode electrode to achieve even adequate, let alone exemplary, performance. However, in order to take command of the low-temperature fuel cell market, AEMFCs cannot simply reach the same performance as incumbent proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which have had decades of development and investment. AEMFCs must be able to realize their most widely quoted advantage over PEMFCs and be produced at a much lower cost than PEMFCs. In the long run, the most likely pathway to acceptably low cost AEMFCs will involve the deployment of PGM-free catalysts at both electrodes. In this Viewpoint, we will discuss what we believe are the most promising approaches to achieve PGM-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (AEMFC cathode) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (AEMFC anode), as well as provide our perspective on key issues that must be addressed to craft these catalysts into high-performing, durable electrodes.									57	1	0	0	3	0	57			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100027

Here we report the fabrication of Zn-doped NiFeOxHy (Zn;NiFeOxHy) that has advanced electrocatalytic activity and stability in comparison to pure NiFeOxHy in the OER via simple chemical bath deposition and electrochemical activation. The improvement with Zn;NiFeOxHy is due to the Zn2+ dopant, a strong Lewis acid that modulates its electronic property for better intermediate binding for the electrochemical process, resulting in the stabilization of the OER-active phase. This work opens up an opportunity to elucidate the detailed mechanism of NiFeOxHy-based electrocatalysts and improves our understanding of redox tuning through inductive effects, thereby leading to advanced OER catalyst developments.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100028

The whole catalytic cycle has been verified to be a biomimetic approach through the formation of the alloxan hydroperoxide reactive intermediate.

ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			253	264		10.1021/acscatal.9b01925				JAN 3 2020	2020	We use density functional theory calculations to study a group of 213 materials known as MXenes toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia. So far, all computational studies have only considered the NRR chemistry on unfunctionalized (bare) MXenes. In this study, we investigate a total of 65 bare and functionalized MXenes. We establish free energy diagrams for the NRR on the basal planes of 55 different M2XTx MXenes (M = Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W; X = C, N) to span a large variety of possible chemistries. Energy trends with respect to the metal as well as nonmetal constituent of the MXenes are established for both bare and functionalized MXenes. We determine the limiting potentials and find that either the formation of NH3 from *NH2 or the formation of *N2H is the potential limiting reaction step for bare and functionalized MXenes, respectively. We find several Mo-, W-, and V-based MXenes (Mo2C, Mo2N, W2N, W2NH2, and V2N) to have suitable theoretical overpotentials for the NRR. Importantly, calculated Pourbaix stability diagrams combined with selectivity analysis, however, reveal that all bare MXenes are not stable under relevant NRR operating conditions. The only functionalized MXene with the three minimum required properties (i) having a low theoretical overpotential, (ii) being stable under NRR conditions, and (iii) having selectivity toward NRR rather than the parasitic HER is W2CH2, which is a H-terminated MXene. Finally, on the basis of our findings, we explore other routes for improving the NRR chemistry by studying 10 additional MXenes with the chemical formula M3X2Tx and MXenes with other functional groups (T-x = S, F, Cl). This opens up a larger variety and tunability of MXenes to be considered for the NRR.									44	3	0	0	1	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100030		
J	Taitt, Brandon J.; Bender, Michael T.; Choi, Kyoung-Shin								Impacts of the Regeneration Pathways of the Oxoammonium Cation on Electrochemical Nitroxyl Radical-Mediated Alcohol Oxidation								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			265	275		10.1021/acscatal.9b03241				JAN 3 2020	2020	Recent studies investigating the electrocatalytic properties of nitroxyl radicals (e.g. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)) for electrochemical alcohol oxidation have demonstrated that the thermodynamic equilibrium oxidation potential and the steric environments unique to each nitroxyl radical have significant implications for their electrocatalytic abilities for alcohol oxidation. However, as the catalytic cycle of the nitroxyl radical involves not only the production and use of the oxoammonium cation for alcohol oxidation but also the regeneration of the oxoammonium cation from the hydroxylamine, the mechanism and rate of the regeneration of the oxoammonium cation critically affect the overall rate of electrochemical nitroxyl radical-mediated alcohol oxidation. Currently, a detailed understanding of this important aspect is lacking. Herein, the factors that affect the regeneration pathways of the oxoammonium cation are systematically investigated, and the impact that the regeneration pathways have on the overall catalytic activity for electrochemical alcohol oxidation is demonstrated. In this study, 4-acetamido TEMPO and 2-azaadamantane-N-oxyl, which are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of nitroxyl radical derivatives in terms of thermodynamic driving force and steric effects, are used as example nitroxyl radicals. As such, the results and discussion provided in this study can be used as comprehensive guidelines to understand the catalytic activity and regeneration pathways of any TEMPO derivative or polycyclic nitroxyl radical during electrochemical alcohol oxidation.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100031

Starting with the chiral ferrocenyl acetals, 1-[(2S,4S)-4-methoxymethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl]-1',2',3',4',5'-R-5-ferrocenes ((-)-3b, R = Me; (-)-3c, R = Ph; (-)-3d, R = Bn), N-tosylamino and formyl groups were introduced at the 1- and 2-positions of the ferrocene cores in (S)-11b-d with control of the planar chirality. After the reaction with ethynylmagnesium bromide, generated propargyl alcohol derivatives (S)-17 were treated with MnO2 and catalytic tetrabutylammonium iodide to give the planar-chiral pyridones by the iodide-catalyzed cyclization. This method is highly practical with a shorter and higher-yield sequence without using noble metal catalysts. Planar-chiral ferroco-pyridones (S)-2b-d were reacted with various Me3SiNR2 compounds to give a library of ferrocene-fused 4-dialkylaminopyridines ((S)-1, DAAPs) in high yields as single enantiomers by the detosylative amination. The cymantrene-fused DAAPs were also prepared in the same way. The library of chiral DAAPs was examined in the two asymmetric reactions as organocatalysts, and some newly prepared Fc-DAAPs showed better enantioselectivity than the known species.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100034

However, bifunctional catalysts suffer from low productivity due to the inertness of CO2 and high activation energy of C-C coupling. Herein, we report a highly active bifunctional catalyst consisting of a ZnO-ZrO2 aerogel and zeolite H-ZSM-5 for the hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics with 76% selectivity at a singlepass CO2 conversion of 16%. The selectivity of CH4 is lower than 1% at the same time. The space-time yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is as high as 0.24 g g(oxide)(-1) h(-1) under the reaction conditions of 340 degrees C and 40 bar over ae-ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, which outperforms the previously reported catalysts, including modified Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. We demonstrate that the ZnO-ZrO2 aerogel catalyst, which is prepared by a combined sol-gel and subsequent supercritical drying method, not only possesses high surface area but also provides large amounts of oxygen vacancies. The formation rate of the methanol intermediate over ZnO-ZrO2 is dominated by the total amount of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the stable performance of the bifunctional catalyst under industrially relevant conditions suggests promising prospects for industrial applications.									55	5	0	0	2	0	60			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100035

Conventional methodologies to prepare these chemicals, however, suffer from using toxic, corrosive starting materials and/or employing harsh reaction conditions. Recent advances suggest that heterogeneous catalysts are promising to promote the formation of organonitrogen chemicals from cheap and abundant materials. In this Review, we summarize the most recent developments using supported solid catalysts to make organonitrogen chemicals from oxygen-containing feedstock and NH3. We introduce four key transformations including carbonyls/alcohols to amines, alcohols/carbonyls to nitriles, alcohols/nitriles to amides, and alcohols/carbonyls to N-heterocycles. In each section, the function of the catalyst and the structure activity correlations are discussed. Auxiliary factors affecting the performance of the catalysts, such as solvent effect, substituent group effect, and/or reactor design are also reviewed.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100036

However, the exploration of its utility in homogeneous catalysis is currently far less reported. In this work, we have investigated the transferability of the concept of scaling relations to a homogeneous catalysis reaction known as the Buchwald-Hartwig amination (BHA) reaction. The reaction of PhBr with MeNH2 using 37 different Pd-L complexes (L = phosphine ligand) is studied, and scaling relations are established among the reaction intermediates and transition states. Using the scaling relations, we construct volcano plots, which is the plot of the log(rate) vs the descriptor intermediate energy. The insights from the volcano plots agree well with the experimental trends from the literature and give direction toward better catalyst design.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100037

The achievement of excellent activity and high Faradaic efficiency in a wide potential range is critical for mature applications. To this regard, we first employed density functional theory simulations to predict activity of Bi nanotubes and Bi nanosheets to CO2RR and selectivity toward formate. The theoretical thermodynamic analysis of the reaction energetics suggests that the limiting potential for CO2 reduction to HCOOH decreases with the increase of the curvature, suggesting a wider potential window of Bi nanotubes for formate formation. Then, Bi nanotubes with highly curved surface were experimentally prepared, showing a large current density (-39.4 mA cm(-2) at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) for CO2 reduction and a maximum formate selectivity of 97% at -1.0 V vs RHE. More importantly, compared with Bi nanosheets, an appreciable selectivity for formate was achieved on Bi nanotubes in a significantly wider potential window of similar to 600 mV (selectivity > 80%). This research provides not only the CO2RR activity-surface structure relationship of metallic Bi but also an efficient strategy for the rational design of electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity in a wide potential window for CO2RR, which is favorable for compatible application with varied types of photovoltaics and other renewable energy sources.									61	0	0	0	2	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100040

Transition-metal-promoted Mo-based catalysts (M/MoO3/SiO2) showed different selectivity patterns from the transition metal supported on silica (M/SiO2). All molybdenum-based catalysts displayed a similar selectivity pattern, consisting of 15-20% of CH4, 30-40% of C2+ hydrocarbons, and 35-40% of oxygenates. The addition of transition metals to molybdenum oxide promoted the catalytic activity by an order of magnitude. Temperature program reduction indicated hydrogen spillover from the transition metals to molybdenum species. H-2-D-2 exchange rate measurements showed that the addition of the transition metal enhanced the rate of H-2 dissociation on the catalyst. CO chemisorption measurements indicated that transition-metal-promoted molybdenum catalysts consist of a similar amount of strong adsorption sites, which may originate from the reduced transition metal, and weak adsorption sites, which may originate from reduced molybdenum oxides. A dual-site mechanism is suggested in which low-valent molybdenum species dissociate CO and generate CHx groups that are hydrogenated to hydrocarbons or react with adsorbed CO on higher-valent Mo sites to form higher alcohols. Ni, Co, and Ru are able to generate CHx groups and enhance the production of C2+ oxygenates, whereas all of the transition metals studied are able to provide sites for H-2 dissociation and H spillover to molybdenum oxide, leading to further enhancement in catalytic activity compared to MoOx/SiO2.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100041

Ni catalysis of activation of C-H bonds of methane to H-2 and C is well-known. We have tried to control the catalysis of Ni via the addition of second elements and found silica-supported nickel phosphide (Ni-P/SiO2) materials as active catalysts for the DCM reaction at 1173 K. The products included C2H4 (ethylene), C2H6 (ethane), C2H2 (acetylene), C3H6 (propylene), C6H6 (benzene), C7H8 (toluene), and C10H8 (naphthalene). The formation of Ni2P on silica was determined using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Pure Ni2P material without support showed a fine catalytic activity for the DCM reaction. Almost the same activation energies of the Ni2P (249 kJ mol(-1)) and Ni-P/SiO2 catalysts (251 kJ mol(-1)) were obtained in the conversion rate of methane, which were lower than that of SiO2 (365 kJ mol(-1)). This indicated that Ni2P was the activate phase for the DCM reaction. The Ni2P phase activates C-H bonds of methane and converts to ethane. Other higher hydrocarbons were produced from ethane in the gas phase at 1173 K.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100042

Given the high reactivity of alpha-OH carbonyls, the main challenge was control of selectivity in a cascade of parallel and consecutive reactions during reductive amination. The type of solvent and catalyst, preferably methanol and Pd, respectively, are key enabling parameters to achieve high product yields. A kinetic study on product intermediates accompanied with detailed product analysis (MS and NMR) suggested a general mechanistic scheme and validation with density functional theory calculations provided a rational understanding of the solvent effect in terms of energetics and kinetics. Primary alkanolamines (AA) such as 2-(dimethylamino)-ethanol are preferred products, and large excess of the amine reagent is not required to reach almost quantitative yields. Interestingly substoichiometric amine-to-GA ratio allows for high yield of higher (consecutive) AAs such as N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and triethanolamine, for which a peculiar cyclic 5-membered oxazolidinic precursor was analyzed (e.g., for reaction with monomethylamine to MDEA). The shift to diamine-selective (DA) reactions is possible by switching to a two-step one-pot approach. With ethylene glycol as a preferred solvent, high yield of an unsaturated C-2-enediamine precursor is obtained under an inert atmosphere, followed by its metal-catalyzed hydrogenation at elevated temperature to the final DA product such as N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene-diamine. A conceptual model of the catalytic reductive amination routes that allows production of a variety of ethylamines with up to +90 C % yield is thus presented. The successful preparation and sensory assessment of a GA-based diester quat in fabric softener formulations demonstrates the viability of a full bio-based and drop-in production route for high-value chemicals, directly from GA as a platform molecule.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100044

This approach represents a rare example of harnessing challenging tertiary radicals in photoredox/nickel cross-coupling. Oxetanes are often employed in medicinal chemistry as carbonyl or gem-dimethyl bioisosteres, but their accessibility is hampered by the lack of practical synthetic methods. The strategy reported here utilizes a readily available oxetanyl amino acid building block in a cross-coupling manifold to rapidly access oxetane scaffolds with broad functional group tolerance. Computational studies reveal that a catalytic cycle beginning with Ni(0)-Ni(II) oxidative addition, rather than radical addition to Ni(0), is operative for reactions with aminooxetanyl radicals. Consequently, for radical-based photoredox/nickel-catalyzed cross-couplings, the preferred mechanistic pathway has a fundamental dependence on the identity of the radical.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100045

To maximize reactivity toward both entails limiting the catalyst size while maintaining reactivity and avoiding aggregation. Frame-like hollow nanostructures (nanoframes) provide the required open structure with sufficient channels into the interior volume. We demonstrate here the design and synthesis of CoP nanoframes (CoP NFs) by a strategy involving precipitation, chemical etching, and low-temperature phosphidation steps. It results in impressive bifunctional catalytic activities for both HER and OER and consequently enables a highly efficient water electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) driven by a cell voltage of only 1.65 V. The strategy has been generalized for the preparation of nanoframe Co dichalcogenides CoX2 NFs, with X = S, Se, and Te. The results of electrochemical measurements, supported by density functional theory calculations, show that HER catalytic activities for the series follow the sequence: CoP NFs > CoSe2 NFs > CoS2 NFs > CoTe2 NFs.									115	3	0	0	5	0	116			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100046

Highly active transition-metal/metal oxides are considered promising materials for protecting the silicon surface, as they exhibit efficient catalytic properties which can reduce overpotential, thus improving the water splitting efficiency. In this study, electrodeposition, a simple and inexpensive method in comparison to vacuum processes such as atomic layer deposition and sputtering, was used to produce efficient Co-based catalysts on silicon substrates to fabricate photoanodes for the oxidation of water to generate oxygen. Distinctive morphologies of the Co-based catalysts were obtained by changing the types of additives in the precursor solution. The PEC performances of n-Si photoanodes with amorphous CoOx nanowalls (NWs) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) depended on the thicknesses and coverages of the catalysts. A fully covered CoOx NWs/n-Si photoanode exhibited stability higher than that of a partially covered Co NPs/n-Si photoanode. The optimized CoOx NWs/n-Si photoanode exhibited an onset potential of 1.06 +/- 0.01 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a photocurrent density of 23.3 +/- 0.8 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE. A charge injection efficiency of almost 100% at 1.4 V vs RHE and high external quantum efficiency of 90% at 700 nm were achieved. These results show that morphology-controlled transition-metal-based catalysts fabricated by the facile electrodeposition method can be one of the promising pathways for the design of high-performance Si-based photoanodes.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100047

Here, inspired by the principle of galvanic cells, we report a generalized spontaneous strategy involving the growth of Cu on M-c ((-) bulk Cu(s) vertical bar Cu2+(c) vertical bar monolayer Cu/M(s) (+)) and the displacement of Cu by Pt (Cu + PtCl42- = Pt + Cu2+ + 4Cl(-)) to synthesize McPtqms. Exemplified by PdcPtqms, we demonstrate that this method requires no special control, electrochemical equipment, or reducing/stabilizing agents, which allows for the scalable preparation of McPtqms. Meanwhile, it is able to produce homogeneous Pt-qms, leading to high electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. This work paves the way for the practical application of McPtqms in electrocatalytic and related fields.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100048

Herein, dilute PdxAu1-x alloy nanoparticles embedded in raspberry colloid-templated silica (x = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.09) are demonstrated to be highly active and selective for the gas-phase hydrogenation of 1-hexyne, exhibiting higher selectivity than pure Pd at high conversion. The conversion of 1-hexyne remains high even for the very low amounts of Pd in Pd0.02Au0.98. These catalysts are highly resistant to sintering-addressing a long-standing challenge in the use of Au-based catalysts. Clear evidence is presented that the addition of the second hydrogen to the half-hydrogenated intermediate is the rate-limiting step and that the stability of the half-hydrogenated intermediate of the alkyne is higher than the half-hydrogenated alkene, which explains the high selectivity even at high conversions. Moreover, of the three compositions investigated, optimum selectivity and activity are observed for the nanoparticles containing 4% Pd. The apparent activation energy for production of 1-hexene from 1-hexyne is measured to be 38 kJ mol(-1) for the Pd0.04Au0.96 catalysts, which is similar to 14 kJ mol(-1) lower than for pure Pd. The hydrogenation is completely, but reversibly, suppressed by adding CO to the reactant mixture, indicating that the Pd centers are the active sites for reaction. The method of templating used in preparation of the catalysts is highly customizable and versatile. This study demonstrates that the composition of the nanoparticles as defined by the dilution ratio of Pd in Au and by the method used to make the supported catalyst is an important tunable parameter that can be used to optimize activity and selectivity of bimetallic systems.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100050

Presently, Pd-based catalysts have demonstrated good acetylene conversion (X-C2H2), however, at the expense of ethylene selectivity (S-C2H4). In this study, we have employed a systematic approach using density functional theory (DFT) to identify the best catalyst in a Cu-Pt system. The DFT results showed that with a 55 atom system at similar to 1.1 Pt/Cu ratio for Pt28Cu27/Al2O3, the d-band center shifted -2.2 eV relative to the Fermi level leading to electron-saturated Pt, which allows only adsorption of ethylene via a pi-bond, resulting in theoretical 99.7% S-C2H4 at nearly complete X-C2H2. Based on the DFT results, Pt-Cu/Al2O3 (PtCu) and Pt/Al2O3 (Pt) nanocatalysts were synthesized via cluster beam deposition (CBD), and their properties and activities were correlated with the computational predictions. For bimetallic PtCu, the electron microscopy results show the formation of alloys. The bimetallic PtCu catalyst closely mimics the DFT predictions in terms of both electronic structure, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and catalytic activity. The alloying of Pt with Cu was responsible for the high C2H4 specific yield resulting from electron transfer between Cu and Pt, thus making PtCu a promising catalyst for SHA.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100051

Herein, the rhodium phosphide (RhPx) nanospecies as cocatalyst is firmly mounted on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets to realize the improved activity and stability for photocatalytic H-2 production. The maximum H-2 production rate over RhPx/g-C3N4 driven by visible light diplays a 5.6-fold improvement compared with Pt/g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the apparent quantum efficiency of 18.4% is achieved at a fixed wavelength of 420 nm that far exceeds the reported g-C3N4 modified with other single-transition-metal phosphides. Particularly, RhPx/g-C3N4 can maintain consistently stable H-2 production when enduring over 25 cyclic reactions with a total of 100 h. The deep insight into the modification effect of RhPx nanospecies reveals that it dramatically facilitates migration and separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and heightens interaction at the heterointerfaces between RhPx nanospecies and g-C3N4 nanosheets. This contribution extends the broad potential application of transition-metal phosphides as cocatalysts in the photocatalytic conversion from solar to hydrogen energy.									95	3	0	0	15	0	95			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100052

In general, the in situ electrochemical transformations of non-oxide catalysts are faster than those of the corresponding oxides, and they typically display improved OER activity. Although many approaches for tuning the active surfaces of catalysts as well as investigations into their roles in the mechanism of adsorption of OER intermediates have been reported, we still have a poor understanding of the dominant active sites formed during the OER. This review highlights current progress into the in situ electrochemical tuning with non-oxide catalysts (especially chalcogenides and pnictides) and offers a comprehensive summary of approaches for the enhancement of OER activity. We describe the non-oxide catalysts that have exhibited promising OER performance with strong in situ electrochemical tuning. We also discuss the preoxidation peak positions of the catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, we explore the probability of new active surface formation on non-oxide catalysts with modified OER mechanisms and the collections of available in situ and ex situ methods to identify the active sites in real-time. Finally, we discuss the challenges affecting the future detection of the active sites of the most promising OER catalysts.									62	1	0	0	4	0	63			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100053

Transition-metal catalysts, particularly those based on Pd, are effective in removing NO3-/NO2- through reduction to N-2 or NH4+. Pd is regarded as the most effective metal for NO3-/NO2- reduction, and as such, few studies have thoroughly explored the performance of other transition metals as a function of varying reaction conditions. In this work, we investigated the NO2- reduction properties of alumina-supported Rh using Pd as a benchmark, where we varied the bulk solution pH to probe the effect of reaction conditions on the catalytic chemistry. Pd expectedly showed a high reduction activity (289 L/g-surface-metal/min) and a high N2 selectivity (>99% at 20% conversion) at low pH and near inactivity at high pH. Surprisingly, the Rh catalyst, while inactive at low pH, showed moderate activity (22 L/g-surface-metal/min) and high NH4+ selectivity (>90% at 20% conversion) at high pH. Hydrazine (N2H4) was also detected as a reaction intermediate when NH4+ was formed. Microkinetic models built with energetics from density functional theory reveal that Rh catalysts are poisoned by NO* at low pH because of the rapid dissociative adsorption of protonated nitrite (HNO2) under acidic conditions, which was confirmed by in aqua surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. NO* poisoning of the Rh surface lessens at increased solution pH because NO2- does not dissociate as readily compared to HNO2, which explains why Rh exhibits higher activity in basic solutions. The microkinetic models further elucidate the competition between N2H4 and NH3/NH4+ formation as a function of pH, where we find that hydrogen surface coverage dictates product selectivity. These results update the common view that only Pd-based catalysts are effective for NO2- reduction and suggest unexplored avenues for nitrogen chemistry.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100054

This study investigates the performance of various noble metals supported on different carriers to identify important parameters for the design of selective catalytic systems. Iridium emerges as the most active and selective metal, and the performance is shown to be strongly influenced by the choice of carrier. Specifically, when supported on TiO2-rutile (TiO2-r), a 2-fold increase in the reaction rate and unprecedented CH3Cl selectivity (<= 95%) are observed, outperforming carriers such as SiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, CeO2, and MgO, as well as TiO2-anatase, which all exhibit comparable activity and selectivity patterns (<= 38% CH3Cl). Moreover, Ir/TiO2-r displays a lower deactivation rate (<= 2.5 times) with respect to other supported systems. Microscopy analysis reveals that the epitaxial growth of IrO2 on TiO2-r impacts the size and morphology of the metal nanostructures obtained upon reduction compared to those formed on other carriers. These epitaxially directed nanostructures suppress the undesired over-hydrogenation of CH3Cl to methane. Kinetic analyses evidence a lower reaction order with respect to H-2 pointing toward mechanistic differences as the origin of the enhanced performance. Finally, the higher stability of the epitaxially directed nanostructures derived from the stronger metal-support interaction is shown to impede sintering, the main deactivation mechanism over standard nanoparticle-based systems; instead, activity losses are linked to increased chlorine uptakes.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100057

In this study, site-specific chemical labeling on Pt stepped surfaces was achieved by attaching the (CO)-C-13 species exclusively on the top side of the (110) steps, while making all of the (111) sites available. The catalysts were then employed in a spectro-electrochemical study of the electro-oxidation of methanol and ethanol. The onset potentials for the formation of (CO2)-C-13 and (CO2)-C-12 revealed the existence of two channels of carbon dioxide formation, separated by about 0.22 V, on the same Pt surface. The active sites with lower overpotential requirement (or lower energy input) for activation of the reaction pathway of CO2 formation resided on the (111) terraces. On the other hand, the active sites with higher overpotential requirement (or higher energy input) for activation of the reaction pathway for electro-oxidation of (COads)-C-13 species to (CO2)-C-13 were at the top of the (110) steps. The findings revealed the identities of the most active sites and least active sites involved in the formation of CO2 during the electro-oxidation of alcohols. On Pt surfaces, the complex interplay involving the steps on the surface favors activation of the pathways for COads oxidation on the (111) terraces, rather than promoting reaction steps directly on the steps themselves.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100058

Doping with guest cations possessing different oxidation states such as Ag can change the chemistry of conventional transition metal oxides and hydroxides, generating unexpected electrocatalytic performances. However, Ag dopants have been found to easily segregate at the surface of electrocatalysts, which induces deactivation. Here, we fabricated Ag-doped CoOOH nanosheet arrays using electrochemical deposition, followed by a simple electrochemical diffusion approach. Surprisingly, we revealed, through atom probe tomography (APT), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) that Ag atoms are homogeneously distributed without any detectable segregation. The Ag-doped CoOOH exhibits enhanced OER performance in terms of overpotential, both experimentally (256 mV) and theoretically (60 mV). The homogeneously distributed Ag dopants facilitate the phase transformation from Co(OH)(2) to the active phase of CoOOH. Calculations show that Ag doping enhances phase stability of CoOOH and exposed Ag dopants act as active sites by releasing -OH adsorbates.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100060

These enzymes catalyze the cofactor-independent acylation of monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG) to diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and phloroglucinol (PG) and have been demonstrated to have a wide substrate scope, making them valuable for potential applications in biocatalysis. Herein, we present a detailed reaction mechanism of PpATase on the basis of quantum chemical calculations, employing a large model of the active site. The proposed mechanism is consistent with available kinetics, mutagenesis, and structural data. The roles of various active site residues are analyzed. Very importantly, the Asp137 residue, located more than 10 angstrom from the substrate, is predicted to be the proton source for the protonation of the substrate in the rate-determining step. This key prediction is corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Based on the current calculations, the regioselectivity of PpATase and its specificity toward non-natural substrates can be rationalized.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100061	31929947

We report here a series of homoleptic Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes and their performances in photochemical water oxidation at pH 1 using persulfate as the sacrificial electron acceptor. These chromophores incorporate CF3 or PO3H2 groups to increase the Ru-III/II standard potentials to 1.3-1.6 V versus NHE, while their homoleptic nature retains photophysical properties (absorption spectra, lifetimes, emission energies, emission quantum yields) comparable to [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+). With [(bda)Ru(isq)(2)] as the catalyst, the chromophores promote visible-light-driven water oxidation with high activity at low pH. The chromophores with phosphonate groups as substituents showed higher activity than expected based on driving force arguments. In addition, kinetic isotope effects as high as similar to 3 were measured, suggesting the involvement of concerted proton-coupled transfer pathways between the catalyst and the chromophores with the phosphonate group acting as the proton acceptor. These chromophores therefore carry out the light absorption, charge migration, and proton transfer roles of P-680, Tyr161, and His190 in Photosystem II on a single molecule and are good candidates for photoelectrochemical water oxidation at low pH in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100063

In this work, we performed extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically study the activity and selectivity of the OCM reactions on several types of the La2O3 and CeO2 catalysts. We theoretically evidenced that the La2O3 catalyst has high hydrocarbon selectivity but low activity, while the CeO2 shows an opposite performance. These results can be largely rationalized by the calculated reaction energetics in generating the key CH3 center dot intermediates and further protecting them from excessive oxidation on the surface. We then proposed two strategies to improve the OCM activity while maintaining the selectivity of the La2O3 catalyst. Geometrically, by constructing the stepped La2O3(210) surface exposing lattice oxygens with low coordination numbers, both the heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in methane and the occurrence of the key CH3 center dot intermediates could be promoted. Electronically, codoping of Sr and Ce into La2O3 could favor the direct formation of CH3 center dot and further avoid its deactivation on the surface, leading to the significantly improved OCM performance. By conducting further analyses on the thermostability of the catalysts and calculating catalytic energetics of the complete reaction cycle, we excluded the practical application of the high-Miner-index La2O3 surfaces, but we theoretically predicted the Sr/Ce-La2O3 catalyst with a proper doping concentration to be highly efficient for catalyzing the OCM reactions.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100064

However, relationships between the catalytic behavior of atomically dispersed metal cations and active sites on metal nanoparticles have been difficult to establish, in large part because of the difficulty in characterizing the local atomic structure of these metal species. Here, we use the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of m-cresol, a model bio-oil compound, to understand relationships between metal structure and reactivity down to the limit of atomically dispersed active sites. Through a combination of kinetic studies, spectroscopic characterization, and density functional theory calculations, we find that isolated Pt cations supported on TiO2 are significantly less active than small Pt clusters for m-cresol HDO due to their lower activity for hydrogen dissociation and their weaker interaction with m-cresol. We demonstrate that m-cresol HDO reaction kinetics are particularly sensitive to the active Pt structure, suggesting that the catalytic reactivity can be a more reliable indicator of catalyst structure than commonly used characterization approaches. These findings provide insights into the ability of isolated Pt cations to catalyze elementary processes critical for hydrogenation catalysis.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100065

Compared to Pt/C, the PtCo/C electrocatalyst possesses higher Pt 5d-orbital vacancy, low level of oxygen species chemisorption on the surface Pt atoms and shorter Pt-Pt bond length (R), and consequently an enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. During the ADT process, a drastic drop in ORR activity after 30 000 ADT cycles can be observed in both the electrocatalysts in spite of their different activity degradation mechanisms. For Pt/C, XAFS results revealed that the oxidation of Pt during the ADT process induced the structure transformation from the partial-coverage surface PtO layer to the full-coverage surface and partial-coverage subsurface PtO layer, resulting in the loss of the Pt active site and consequently the decrease in the ORR activity. For PtCo/C, the oxidation of the Co atom induced the attenuation of strain and ligand effects, and the dissolution and segregation of CoO caused the increase in Pt outer layer thickness during the ADT process, mainly determined the decrease in ORR activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100066

The conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals is vital for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and neutralizing the negative impacts of CO2 emissions on the environment. Various CO2 conversion routes have been proposed on the basis of heterogeneous catalysis. However, the development of a high-performance catalyst with satisfactory activity and selectivity remains challenging. In past decades, the role of ceria in activating CO2 under mild conditions has been widely demonstrated, which has inspired the design of novel heterogeneous catalysts and contributed to the extensive catalytic applications in CO2 conversion reactions. The applications of ceria have been studied in three groups of CO2 conversion reactions, including hydrogenation of CO2, activation of CO2 with alkanes, and nonreductive CO2 transformations. Investigations into these reactions show that CeO2 is a highly tunable material with great potential for CO2 catalysis due to its unique properties such as abundant oxygen vacancy and metal-support interaction. The catalytic performance of CeO2-based catalysts can be improved by various strategies including metal doping, forming mixed oxides or solid solution, as well as morphological control. Future works are proposed to address the challenges in current research and to further advance the CeO2-based catalysts in CO2 conversion reactions.									43	0	0	0	3	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100067

Direct cleavage of the C-C bonds in lignin linkages is significant, but it is challenging to obtain low-molecular-weight aromatic monomers. Herein, using vanadium catalysts under visible light, we selectively cleave the C-C bonds in beta-1 and beta-O-4 interlinkages occluded in lignin models and extracts by an oxidative protocol. Visible light irradiation triggered single electron transfer between the substrate and the catalyst, which further induced the selective C-alpha-C-beta bond cleavage and generated the final aromatic products through radical intermediates. Using this photocatalytic chemistry, the reactivity of lignin models and the selectivity of C-alpha-C-beta bond cleavage were significantly improved. More importantly, this protocol affords aromatic monomers through the fragmentation of organosolv lignins even at room temperature, indicating the potential of photocatalytic C-C bond cleavage of lignin linkages under ambient conditions.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100068

At odds with stereo selectivity, regioselectivity turned out to be only modestly impacted by the chemical structure of the electron donors used as surface modifiers. A clear and simple relationship between regioselectivity and "hydrogen response", and, therefore, polymer molecular weight modulation was highlighted.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100069

Since the MoS2 edge was proposed as a major active site, molecular and polymeric analogues to the MoS2 edge have been widely explored as the HER catalysts. In particular, amorphous MoSx coordination polymers have been considered as active HER catalysts because they are rich in unsaturated Mo-S coordination, which is the characteristic of the active MoS2 edge. Herein, we report that the simple monomeric thiomolybdate (MoS42-) could adopt a polymeric chain structure, which exhibited high HER activity; its turnover frequency surpassed those of dimeric [Mo2S12](2-)- and trimeric [Mo3S13](2-)-derived MoSx catalysts. This high HER activity of monomeric MoS42- is attributed to the polymerization of MoS42- anions, generating active molecular analogues that comprise monomeric S2- sites bridging Mo(V) and Mo(W). Density functional theory calculations of possible polymeric chain structures identified the Mo(IV)Mo(V)(2)(S-2(2-))(2)(S2-)(5) unit as the most plausible structure that best matched the experimentally deduced structure. The Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption on the bridging S2- (p-S2-) site in Mo(IV)Mo(V)(2)(S-2(2-))(2)(S2-)(5) was found to be -0.05 eV, which is close to the thermoneutral state. Combined analyses by resonance Raman spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure suggested the role of Mo-oxo (Mo=O-x) species to generate the active Mo(V)-(mu-S2-)-Mo(IV) center for effective hydrogen adsorption.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100070

All three Cu-based electrodes exhibit high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO2, reduction toward C2H4 production. The CuSn-DAT electrode exhibits the highest FE for CO (similar to 90% at -0.4 V) and C2H4 (similar to 60% at -0.8 V) production and high current density (similar to-225 mA/cm(2) at -0.8 V). In situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) studies in a flow cell obtained from the three Cu-based samples show a correlation between the decreased oxide content on the Cu surface, increased presence of CO, and increased activity for CO and C-2 production. The CuSn-DAT electrode has the lowest amount of Cu2O and exhibits the highest activity, whereas the Cu-DAT electrode has an increasing Cu2O content and exhibits lower activity as the potential is made negative. These results demonstrate that incorporation of different well-mixed alloy materials provides a way to tune CO2, reduction speciation.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100072		
J	Zhang, Minhua; Ren, Jie; Yu, Yingzhe								Insights into the Hydrogen Coverage Effect and the Mechanism of Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins Process on Fe5C2 (510)								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			689	701		10.1021/acscatal.9b03639				JAN 3 2020	2020	Direct production of light olefins from synthesis gas through the Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) process over iron carbide catalysts is promising. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of different hydrocarbons on clean surfaces. However, when these mechanisms were discussed before, the influence of adsorbed surface species, especially surface H, on the mechanisms is less understood. Hence, we reported a density functional theory (DFT) study on the hydrogen coverage effect and the mechanism of the FTO process on Fe5C2 (510). It is found that the Fe5C2 (510) surface may be covered with a layer of H in the FTO process. The mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on the Fe5C2 (510) surface prefers to proceed via the CO insertion mechanism rather than the carbide mechanism in the presence of adsorbed H. The optimized C-C coupling pathways feature H-assisted CO coupling pathways in which the CHCHO pathways (E-a = 1.15 eV) and the CH2CHO pathways (E-a = 1.10 eV) are favorable. The methane formation pathway is an alternative major pathway on the chi-Fe5C2 (510) surface due to its relatively low barrier energies (E-a = 0.80 eV). The formation of oxygenates is unfavorable due to the high C-O dissociation reactivity. The olefin ratio for ethylene and ethane is influenced by two competitive processes in a stepwise hydrogenation. It is suggested from the mechanism that high C-C coupling activity and the matching hydrogenation activity with the former are the key directions to modify iron-based FTO catalysts.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100074

However, the electrochemically active anions in seawater can cause the corrosion of electrodes or undesirable side reactions during the anodic reaction at the anode, thus degrading the overall system efficiency. Hence, it is imperative to develop highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for efficient seawater electrolysis. In this study, carbon-coated sodium cobalt-iron pyrophosphate (Na2Co1-xFexP2O7/C, 0 <= x <= 1) nanoparticles (NCFPO/C NPs) and NCFPO/C NPs loaded on a carbon cloth (NCFPO/C@CC) are fabricated as a promising OER electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater electrolysis. The electrocatalytic OER performance of the NCFPO/C NPs is optimized by controlling their Co/Fe ratio. NCFPO/C@CC acts as an efficient OER electrocatalyst during the OER test in an alkaline saline solution without corroding the electrode and generating reactive chloride species. It also exhibits long-term stability and durability with continuous oxygen generation. In addition, NCFPO/C@CC shows the electrocatalytic OER activity in alkaline seawater, demonstrating that NCFPO/C is a promising candidate as an OER electrocatalyst for realistic alkaline seawater electrolysis.									29	1	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100075

Platinum Catalyzed C-H Activation and the Effect of Metal-Support Interactions								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			710	720		10.1021/acscatal.9b03807				JAN 3 2020	2020	Catalytic C-H bond activation of methane and ethane on a series of silica supported platinum catalysts (Pt/SiO2) was studied by using hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange. Kinetic experiments demonstrate that under the reaction conditions studied, the rate of C-H bond activation shows approximate first order dependence in alkane and inverse first order dependence in D-2. The rate of C-H activation is affected by the presence of sodium on the silica support, where sodium-free supports have the fastest rates of C-H activation, as assessed by H/D exchange. CO adsorption and FTIR studies indicate that the Pt particles on the sodium-free support are more electron-deficient, having the most blue-shifted linear CO stretch, while sodium-containing supports are more electron-donating, having the most red-shifted linear CO stretch. It is proposed, based on the results described in this article and previous work in the literature, that more electron-donating supports cause the Pt particles to be more electron-rich and to adsorb D* (or H*) more strongly, thereby stabilizing the ground state and resting state of the catalyst, resulting in a decreased rate of C-H activation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100076

Control and understanding of electronic configuration at the active sites are of fundamental importance to achieve this goal. Herein, highly porous Ni1-xCuxO (p-Ni1-xCuxO) nanowire (NW) arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) were synthesized, characterized, and utilized as high-performance catalytic anode for catalyzing the ammonia-borane (AB) electrooxidation reaction (ABOR). This electrocatalyst shows exceptional electrocatalytic properties including an extremely low onset potential (-0.316 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), a high Faradaic efficiency (>98%), and long-term durability toward the ABOR, far outperforming the noble metal-based catalysts. Reaction free energies computed as a function of electrode potential by density-functional theory indicate that doping of Cu for Ni1-xCuxO is favorable for energetically decreasing the energy barriers in the multistep reaction pathways. The modulation of the electronic structure of bimetallic Ni1-xCuxO catalysts underlies the catalytic mechanism by the electronic coupling effect between Ni and Cu.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100077

The reaction represents the third mechanism for ring opening of nonplanar amide bonds discovered. Adding to the facile hydrolytic cleavage of nonplanar N-C(O) amide bonds and sigma N-C bond scission reactions, this reaction manifold engages a peripheral reactivity principle that hinges upon ring strain energy enforced by the twisted amide bond. Considering the wide utility of ring-opening olefin metathesis reactions in various aspects of chemistry, we anticipate that this ring-opening methodology will be of broad interest and could lead to the development of ROM reactions of twisted amides as a powerful synthetic tool.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100079

Herein, we report the bismuth-based catalyst in the efficient electroconversion of CO2 for the formation of formate with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 91% and partial current density of similar to 8 mA cm(-2) at -0.9 V vs RHE. Experimental and theoretical results show that the bismuth-oxygen structure of bismuth oxides is beneficial for a higher adsorption of CO2 and the rate-determining route switching from the initial fast pre-equilibrium of electron transfer process to the subsequent hydrogenation step, accompanied by a lower free energy of intermediate. This work may offer valuable insights into crystal structure engineering to achieve efficient electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction toward generation of valuable products.									74	4	0	0	6	0	76			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100080

In this work, we report a surface active-site engineering approach for modulating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using the macrocycle cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]). A pristine gold surface functionalized with CB[6] nanocavities was studied as a hybrid organic inorganic model system that utilizes host-guest chemistry to influence the heterogeneous electrocatalytic reaction. The combination of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and electrocatalytic experiments in conjunction with theoretical calculations supports capture and reduction of CO2 inside the hydrophobic cavity of CB[6] on the gold surface in aqueous KHCO3 at negative potentials. SEIRA spectroscopic experiments show that the decoration of gold with the supramolecular host CB[6] leads to an increased local CO2 concentration close to the metal interface. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on a CB[6]-coated gold electrode indicates differences in the specific interactions between CO2 reduction intermediates within and outside the CB[6] molecular cavity, illustrated by a decrease in current density from CO generation, but almost invariant H-2 production compared to unfunctionalized gold. The presented methodology and mechanistic insight can guide future design of molecularly engineered catalytic environments through interfacial host-guest chemistry.									19	1	0	0	3	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100081	31929948

Here we show visible-light H-2 production from benzyl alcohol (BAL) with controllable generation of deoxybenzoin (DOB) or benzoin (BZ) through tandem redox reactions. Particularly, DOB synthesis circumvents the use of expensive feedstocks and environmentally unfriendly catalysts that are required previously. Under the irradiation of blue LEDs, the key of steering the major product to DOB rather than BZ is to decrease the conduction band bottom potentials of the ZnIn sulfide catalysts by increasing the Zn/In ratio, which results in the dehydration of intermediate hydrobenzoin (HB) to DOB proceeding in a redox-neutral mechanism and consuming an electronhole pair. As a proof of concept, this method is used to synthesize DOB derivatives in gram scale.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100082

To advance our understanding of the MOR mechanism, we have employed dual thin-layer differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) to study reaction intermediates on a family of Pt-Fe-Cu ternary ordered intermetallics. We found that PtFe0.7Cu0.3/C exhibited the highest CO2 production efficiency, while PtFe0.5Cu0.5/C generated the largest proportion of methyl formate or formic acid. The different selectivity is partially ascribed to the difference in lattice compressive strain due to the incorporation of Fe and Cu atoms. We propose a dual-pathway mechanism in which the increase in lattice contraction can stabilize the intermediates forming methyl formate or formic acid, while a moderate lattice strain leads to the highest CO2 generation via COad intermediates. Our work on ternary catalysts may provide valuable insights for designing electrocatalysts for the MOR.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100083

High temperature favors the highly endothermic process, while catalyst thermal deterioration is a major obstacle. Here we report a robust Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst prepared via physical vapor deposition method that exhibits 1 or 2 orders of magnitude higher activity than conventional ruthenium or nickel catalysts. Importantly, instead of deactivation or coke deposition, the catalyst demonstrates a surprising activity increase by 1.5 times after reaction at 850 degrees C for 600 h. Ru initially was dispersed as isolated atoms on MgAl2O4, then condensed into unfaceted clusters (1.1 nm), and finally retained as faceted nanoparticles (NPs, 2.7 nm) upon testing, becoming more and more active by decreasing the barrier of breaking the C-H bond of methane. The low Ru content (0.15 wt %) and high space-time yield make it cost-competitive to regeneration-required nickel catalysts, paving a way to develop affordable commercial precious metal catalyst.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100085

The electrode is a key component that controls the efficiency of water splitting. Although noble metals such as Pt, Ru and Ir can achieve high energy efficiencies, their application in water splitting is limited by their high cost. Thus, developing efficient noble-metal-free electrodes is necessary to achieve sustainable hydrogen societies. Here, we report a technique of graphene encapsulation of NiMo alloys for realizing both high catalytic activity and high chemical stability in non-noble metal anodes in transition metal impurities-free aqueous KOH electrolyte. Electrochemical analysis showed that graphene encapsulation significantly enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the NiMo anodes and provided long electrode lifetimes and performances comparable to those of commercially available anodes. Density functional theory calculation revealed that graphene encapsulation significantly reduced the adsorption energy of intermediates onto the NiMo surface, thereby remarkably enhancing the OER activity. The graphene encapsulation method provides a promising electrode design to improve the performance in water splitting electrolyzers.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100086

This transformation proceeds via a proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) activation of an alcohol O-H bond to generate a key alkoxy radical intermediate, which then facilitates the beta-scission of a vicinal C-C bond. Notably, this single-step depolymerization is driven solely by visible-light irradiation, requires no stoichiometric chemical reagents, and produces no stoichiometric waste. This method exhibits good efficiency and excellent selectivity for the activation and fragmentation of the beta-O-4 linkage in the polymer backbone, even in the presence of numerous other PCET-active functional groups. The feasibility of this protocol in enabling the cleavage of the beta-1 linkage in model lignin dimers was also demonstrated. These results provide further evidence that visible-light photocatalysis can serve as a viable method for the direct conversion of lignin biomass into valuable arene feedstocks.									24	0	0	0	4	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100087

Pulsed laser deposition was used to grow (100) IrO2 on a (100) SrTiO3 substrate at deposition temperature ranging from room temperature to 600 degrees C. Detailed structural and morphological characterization was performed using AFM, XRD, and X-ray reciprocal space mapping (RSM) to unravel the geometrical arrangement of [IrO6] octahedra in the (100) IrO2 thin films. It is shown that the symmetry mismatch between the substrate and the epitaxial thin film imposed an orthorhombic distortion of the tetragonal structure of IrO2 and, as a consequence, the [IrO6] geometry is distorted. These data were correlated to the OER characteristics established from electrochemical measurements. DFT modeling was employed to relate differences in surface relaxation of IrO2 films prepared at different temperatures with changes in OER activity. Vacancy formation leads to higher surface stability at temperatures around 500 degrees C, which corresponds to the deposition temperature at which the electrocatalytic activity of (100) epitaxial IrO2 film is maximal.									21	3	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100088

The low dispersion of a Pt particle at the support surface and sintering of Pt nanoparticles under the harsh reaction condition are the main challenges in the practical application of this catalyst. Herein, highly efficient Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts are developed for propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability in this reaction. Full characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H-2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques on these catalysts reveal that the Pt clusters are localized at the Sn single-site in the zeolitic framework, which allows the generated Pt clusters to be homogeneously dispersed at the surface zeolite. The high performance of Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts under a high reaction temperature is mainly due to a strong interaction between the Pt cluster and Sn-zeolite. An initial propane conversion of 50%, high propylene selectivity of above 99%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h(-1) high TOF of 114 s(-1), and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn-2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 degrees C.									41	2	0	0	4	0	42			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100089

The application of the organocatalyst and the hypervalent iodine group transfer reagent allowed for metal-free C-H functionalization and C-C bond formation. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at -40 degrees C and in the presence of an amine base, providing access to an array of heteroaryl-propargyl ketones containing various substituents in good to excellent yields. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by means of both experiments and density functional theory calculations. C-13-labeling and computations determined that the key alkynyl transfer step occurs via an unusual direct substitution at an acetylenic carbon, wherein an iodine-based leaving group is exchanged by a Breslow intermediate nucleophile. Moreover, kinetic studies revealed that the turnover-limiting step of the catalytic cycle is the generation of the Breslow intermediate, whereas the subsequent C-C bond formation is a fast process. These results are fully reproduced and rationalized by the calculated full free energy profile of the reaction, showing that the largest energy span is located between the protonated form of NHC catalyst and the transition state for the carbene attack on the aldehyde substrate.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100091

The production of MA over SSZ-13 after 24 h on stream at 165 degrees C and 1 bar approaches that obtained from mordenite and is significantly higher than from ferrierite at comparable Si/Al of ca. 10. To understand the origin of the activity, SSZ-13 materials are synthesized with variable Si/Al, characterized via several techniques including multinuclear magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, and evaluated for their carbonylation activity. While MA production rates increase with decreasing Si/Al, the correlation is nonlinear due to the effect of Si/Al on the acid site distribution within different confining environments, and the associated impact of the latter on the rate-determining transition state barrier. Enhanced MA production rates trend with acid sites located at the eight-membered ring (8MR) that are increasingly populated as framework Al content increases. Density functional theory analyses of transition state energies as a function of active site location support the experimental findings, where the lowest apparent barriers are associated with the methoxy groups that orient within the plane of the 8MR window. This is due to an optimal charge stabilization of the cationic transition states with the negatively charged oxygens within the 8MR window. The effects of catalyst chemical composition, separate from framework topology, are also investigated using SAPO-34 (the silicoaluminophosphate analog of SSZ-13). Analyses of the H-1 MAS NMR signals and carbonylation activity suggest that the higher acid site strength of SSZ-13 compared to that of the SAPO material is required for effective Bronsted acid catalysis of Koch-type carbonylation pathways.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100092

However, the mechanisms for ORR are generally poorly understood. Here, we report an extensive experimental and first-principles theoretical study of the ORR at nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO). We synthesize three distinct NrGO catalysts and investigate their chemical and structural properties in detail via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and thin-film electrical conductivity. ORR experiments include the pH dependences of 2e(-) versus 4e(-) ORR selectivity, ORR onset potentials, Tafel slopes, and H/D kinetic isotope effects. These experiments show very different ORR behavior for the three catalysts, in terms of both selectivity and the underlying mechanism, which proceeds either via coupled proton-electron transfers (CPETs) or non-CPETs. Reasonable structural models developed from density functional theory rationalize this behavior. The key determinant between CPET vs non-CPET mechanisms is the electron density at the Fermi level under operating ORR conditions. Regardless of the reaction mechanism or electrolyte pH, however, we identify the ORR active sites as sp(2) carbons that are located next to oxide regions. This assignment highlights the importance of oxygen functional groups, while details of (modest) N-doping may still affect the overall catalytic activity, and likely also the selectivity, by modifying the general chemical environment around the active site.									45	2	0	0	2	1	46			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100093

Taking the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) mutant EbSDR8-G94A/S153L (Mu0) with poor activity toward bulky aryl ketones as an example, H145 and Y188 were identified as the engineering targets due to the distinct conformation difference in the two simulation modes. To break the "beam" structure formed by these residues at the entry of cavity C2 in free-state simulation, the substrate-binding pocket was reconstructed, and meanwhile the relative size of cavities C1 and C2 was modulated to improve the enantioselectivity. In this way, mutants for efficient asymmetric reduction of o-halogenated acetophenones, propiophenones, aromatic ketoesters, and diaryl ketones were designed, delivering chiral alcohols with >99% conversion and >98% ee. The effectiveness of this design strategy was also validated by the successful redesign of PpYSDR, generating a variant for efficient reduction of (4-chlorophenyl) 2-pyridyl ketone into the S-product with >99% conversion and 96% ee. MD simulations suggested a suitable binding pocket with proper energy contribution as the ubiquitous mechanism for the improvement of activity and enantioselectivity toward substrates with varied structures. The success in this study provides hints for the rational design of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases with both a broad substrate spectrum and high enantioselectivity.									19	0	0	0	7	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100094

On the Fe/C-terminated Fe3C(010) surface, C-O dissociation of CO and CHxC (x = 1, 2, and 3) with higher barriers is not accessible, while consecutive hydrogenation of adsorbed CO to methanol and surface carbon atom to methane is accessible with low overall barriers and exothermic reaction energies. However, the formed CH3 from surface carbon hydrogenation can couple with adsorbed CO to form surface acetyl (CH3CO), resulting in the formation of the initial C-C bond with comparably low overall barrier and exothermic reaction energy. The formed acetyl can be deoxygenated to surface CH3C, which can couple with surface carbon to form CH3CC. The formation of CH3CO and CH3CC reveals that chain growth on the Fe/C-terminated Fe3C(010)-0.25 surface progresses alternatingly via both carbide and CO insertion mechanisms. The formed surface CH3CC can be hydrogenated into CH3CH2CH2 for next C-C coupling with CO, and this closes the initial chain growth cycle. The larger difference in the adsorption energy of CO and H-2 or the H-2/CO ratio will determine hydrogenation and C-C coupling. On the Fe-terminated Fe3C(010)-0.00 surface, however, CO prefers direct and H-assisted dissociation to C and CH at the B5 site; these two paths have close high overall barriers, and the formed carbon prefers to be hydrogenated into CH2, which can couple with CH to form CH2CH with low overall barrier and exothermic reaction energy, and only the carbide mechanism is operating for chain propagation. Comparison with the Fe/C- and Fe-terminated Fe5C2(100) surfaces as well as metallic Fe surfaces has been made.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100095

Intermolecular amination of C(sp(3))-H bonds by catalytiC-Nitrene transfer is a promising method for forging C-N bonds. An organocatalytic approach to nitrene transfer by way of an iminium salt offers a site-selective method for C(sp(3))-H amination. Understanding of this amination mechanism including the nature of the relevant intermediates and the factors controlling the mechanism of the N-H bond formation step would aid in the design of catalysts and C(sp(3))-H amination methods. In this work, the mechanism of the iminium salt-catalyzed C(sp(3))-H amination via nitrene transfer was elucidated computationally using quantum mechanical methods and molecular dynamics simulations. Dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations provide support for an open singlet biradical species in equilibrium with the lower energy triplet species. Calculations further reveal that, while the singlet biradical species undergoes N-H bond formation by a hydride transfer process, the triplet species forms the N-H bond by H-atom abstraction. Molecular dynamics simulations rule out the possibility of a fast rebound of the carbon substrate following N-H bond formation. A predictive model for mode of activation and site selectivity that is consistent with experimental observations is presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100097	34113476

To address this challenge, the atomically dispersed Pt is anchored on two Mo-based supports with similar morphology and particle size, that is, face-centered cubic-structured alpha-MoC and MoN. Spectroscopic and computational investigations demonstrate that the Pt atoms are coordinated with N atoms in Pt/MoN but with Mo atoms in Pt/alpha-MoC, leading to an entirely different catalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Pt mass activity for Pt/MoN reaches 0.71 A/mg(Pt), at 0.9 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], which is 15 times higher Pt mass activity than that of Pt/alpha-MoC. Density functional theory calculations correlate the better ORR performance of Pt/MoN with the weaker adsorption of OH* because of the modulation of electronic properties of Pt by the coordination with N atoms. This study highlights the importance of controlling the coordination environment of metal atoms in heterogeneous (electro)catalysis and suggests that tuning the coordination environment could be an effective strategy in catalyst development.									42	1	0	0	0	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100098
