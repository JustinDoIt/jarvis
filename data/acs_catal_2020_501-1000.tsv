J	Cheng, Wan-Min; Shang, Rui				Shang, Rui/O-4730-2019	Shang, Rui/0000-0002-2513-2064			Transition Metal-Catalyzed Organic Reactions under Visible Light: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives								ACS CATALYSIS				10	16			9170	9196		10.1021/acscatal.0c01979				AUG 21 2020	2020	The development of transition metal (TM) catalysis for organic synthesis under visible light without recourse to typical photoredox catalysts has become a rapidly growing area of research and has been actively explored in the past several years. Distinct from the extensively developed photoredox catalysis, in which the photocatalyst generally does not directly participate in a bond-forming process, and photocatalyst/TM synergistic catalysis, in which the photocatalyst absorbs photon energy and transfers energy to the TM catalyst through a redox or energy transfer process, this Review focuses on summarizing the recent developments of photocatalytic reactions that use TM complexes to both absorb visible light and participate in catalytic bond formation involving a catalyst covalently bonded intermediate. The contents of this Review are categorized by the transition metal used (Pd, Cu, Co, Ni, Mn, Au, Rh, Fe, Ru), with a descending sequence according to the number of examples reported of each metal, and provide an overview of TM catalysis under visible light reported to April 2020. Future perspectives and personal opinions regarding this actively expanding research field are also discussed.									44	0	0	0	2	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900017

Herein, a zinc-modified ultrastable Y (USY) zeolite containing higher Bronsted acidity was prepared by synergistic treatment with zinc chloride and steaming. The results of characterization showed that selective dealumination and silicon healing due to introduction of zinc ions ([ZnCl](+) and [ZnOH](+)) into zeolite could promote the formation of extra-framework silicon (EFS) and different silicon healing of the Al vacancies, which led to the formation of half-sodalite cages connecting with supercages and thus increased the availability of acidic sites in the sodalite cage. Meanwhile, DFT calculations demonstrated that the acidic strength of protons in the sodalite cage was enhanced by [ZnCl](+) and [ZnOH](+), and the synergy of Bronsted/[ZnCl](+) became stronger. As a result, the strong Bronsted acid was increased by 19%. This translated to higher n-octane and heavy oil (VGO) catalytic cracking activity and gasoline yield.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900018

It is found that the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channels is energetically more favored than the individual sinusoidal and straight channels due to their different local environments. On the basis of the computed Gibbs free energy at 500 degrees C, the rate-determining step for the formation of 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene as the first intermediate is the heterolytic activation of H-2, which is encapsulated in a conjugated frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), generated from the acidic O-H proton transfer to the hydrocarbon substrate. For the subsequent formation of toluene or benzene and o-xylene from 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene hydrocracking, the rate-determining step, which is the heterolytic activation of H-2 encapsulated in a conjugated FLP, determines the selectivity. On the basis of the apparent Gibbs free energy barriers at 500 degrees C, the activity has the decreasing order of T5 > T11 > T1 approximate to T12 approximate to T3 approximate to T7. It is noted that there is no correlation between the Gibbs free energy barriers and the acidic strength based on O-H deprotonation Gibbs free energy and the adsorption enthalpy of pyridine as a probe molecule.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900019

Nevertheless, water as a more abundant and ecofriendly hydrogen source has hardly been used due to the high difficulty in splitting water molecules. Herein, we designed a photocatalytic water-donating transfer hydrogenation (PWDTH) technique, in which hydrogen was extracted from water under light illumination and then in situ added to different unsaturated bonds (C=C, C=O, N=O) for chemical synthesis. Platinum-loaded carbon nitride (Pt/CN) was used as the model catalyst for this cascade reaction, which is beyond its normal applications for water splitting. This approach was highly accessible to efficiency optimization, either by modifying CN for extended light absorption and enhanced charge transfer or by alloying Pt with another metal for better catalytic activities. Remarkably, a quantum efficiency of up to 21.8% was achieved for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under 380 nm irradiation, which is 3 times higher than that obtained in the single water-splitting reaction, indicating that the PWDTH can be more rewarding than hydrogen evolution for solar energy harvesting. Deep insights into the underlying mechanism were provided by detailed measurements and interpretations of femtosecond transient absorption spectra, action spectra (quantum efficiency as a function of excitation wavelength), and reaction kinetic profiles under varied conditions including the variation of light intensities, temperatures, and water isotopes. The mild reaction conditions, simple processing, and broad substituent group tolerance endow this approach with a high potential toward a general solar-to-chemical conversion technique.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900020

Special attention is paid to the role of anharmonicity (a result of collective phenomena) and the deviations from the standard harmonic oscillator approximations, which can fail to provide a reliable assessment of entropy. To address these challenges, advanced methodologies are needed that can explicitly account for these thermodynamic drivers through the appropriate statistical sampling of reactive free-energy surfaces. We discuss where anharmonicity should be expected, where it has been observed from a theoretical perspective, and the methods currently employed to address it. We concentrate on three types of systems where we have observed major, non-negligible anharmonic effects: (1) supported nanoparticles, where the migration of metal atoms, complexes, and entire clusters exhibit anharmonic behavior in their dynamic motion; (2) porous solids, where confinement effects distort potential energy surfaces and hinder molecular motions, resulting in large entropic terms; and (3) solid/liquid interfaces, where interactions between solvent molecules and adsorbed species can result in large solvent organization free energy and unique reactivity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900021

Here, we demonstrate the interplay between the catalyst structure and CO2 hydrogenation on Cu catalysts boosted with nickel species. The nickel dispersion on copper markedly affects the CO2 dissociation activity and catalytic reaction pathways, thus resulting in distinctive catalytic activity and selectivity attributed to Ni. Specifically, the catalyst incorporating nickel alloyed in copper maximizes the synergy between the two metals and is characterized by conversions close to the thermodynamic equilibrium to CO as a product-with switched off methanation-over a wide temperature range. Catalyst performance data, spectra characterizing the catalyst, and theoretical results demonstrate that surface copper with adjacent nickel atoms efficiently activates CO2 via a redox mechanism-with adsorption of CO being suppressed-so that methanation associated with deep hydrogenation of CO is inhibited. The results of this investigation highlight the importance of structures with copper-adjacent-nickel, which appear to offer appealing opportunities for tailoring efficient copper-containing catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900022

However, unmodified Cu exhibits poor selectivity and activity for formate production. Our in situ Raman spectroscopy study detects HCOO* intermediates on the unmodified Cu surface under CO2 electroreduction reaction conditions and confirms their reductive desorption being the rate-limiting step of producing formate. We further show that cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) can dramatically improve the catalysis via competitive adsorption to facilitate HCOO* desorption. The Cu-CTAB interaction leads to a faradic efficiency of 82% and a 56-fold increase in partial current density for CO2 reduction to formate at -0.5 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode in a near-neutral aqueous solution, which is the best performance to date for unmodified Cu under ambient conditions.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900023

The studied reaction was found to involve three sequential steps: (i) protonation of the substrate's N2 atom by Lys893, (ii) nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) to the substrate, and (iii) hydride transfer from the substrate to the sulfur atom of the Moco. The free energy profile that was calculated revealed that the rate-limiting step corresponds to hydride transfer. It was also found that Lys893 plays a relevant role in the reaction, being important not only for the anchorage of the substrate close to the Moco, but also in the catalytic reaction. The variations of the oxidation state of the molybdenum ion throughout the catalytic cycle were examined too. We found out that during the displacement of the products away from the Moco, the transfer of electrons from the catalytic site to the FAD site was proton-coupled. As a consequence, the most favorable and fastest pathway for the enzyme to complete its catalytic cycle was that with Mo-v and a deprotonated SH ligand of the Moco with the FAD molecule converted to its semiquinone form, FADH(center dot).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900024

Its biological activity relies on three aromatic cross-links, which create a cup-shaped topology and allow tight binding to nascent peptidoglycan chains. The cytochrome P450 enzymes OxyB, OxyA, and OxyC have been shown to introduce these synthetically challenging aromatic linkages. The ability to utilize the P450 enzymes in a chemo-enzymatic scheme to generate vancomycin derivatives is appealing but requires a thorough understanding of their reactivities and mechanisms. Herein, we systematically explore the scope of OxyB biocatalysis and report installation of diverse diaryl ether and biaryl cross-links with varying macrocycle sizes and compositions, when the enzyme is presented with modified vancomycin precursor peptides. The structures of the resulting products were determined using one-dimensional/two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), tandem HR-MS, and isotopic labeling, as well as ultraviolet-visible light absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopies. An exploration of the biological activities of these alternative OxyB products surprisingly revealed antifungal properties. Taking advantage of the promiscuity of OxyB, we chemo-enzymatically generated a vancomycin aglycone variant containing an expanded macrocycle. Mechanistic implications for OxyB and future directions for creating vancomycin analogue libraries are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900025	34422446	
J	Ma, Hongfei; Wang, Yalan; Qi, Yanying; Rout, Kumar R.; Chen, De								Critical Review of Catalysis for Ethylene Oxychlorination								ACS CATALYSIS				10	16			9299	9319		10.1021/acscatal.0c01698				AUG 21 2020	2020	Ethylene oxychlorination is the key technology in vinyl chloride (VCM, the monomer of PVC, polyvinyl chloride) production to close the chlorine loop by consuming the HCl released from the former cracking step. Due to the high demand for PVC, this leads to ethylene oxychlorination being one of the most important processes in the industry. This Review covers an indepth analysis of the dynamic nature of active sites for the main and side reactions involved in ethylene oxychlorination, featuring the findings and viewpoints from the dynamic kinetics study and analysis under industrial operating conditions. A unified picture of the mechanism of the surface reactions, and the effect of supports and promoters, has been presented based on the decoupled redoxcycle experiments, which leads to a significantly better understanding of the mechanism and provides valuable guidelines for effective catalyst design. Operando techniques and kinetic tools of the rate-diagram, as well as their application to the study of the redox-cycle in ethylene oxychlorination and kinetic models on both the main product and byproduct, are also reviewed. Perspectives on challenges and new process development and future research focus for better study of the VCM production chemistry are also proposed.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900026		
J	Deshpande, Siddharth; Greeley, Jeffrey					Deshpande, Siddharth/0000-0001-9471-9080			First-Principles Analysis of Coverage, Ensemble, and Solvation Effects on Selectivity Trends in NO Electroreduction on Pt3Sn Alloys								ACS CATALYSIS				10	16			9320	9327		10.1021/acscatal.0c01380				AUG 21 2020	2020	Contamination of groundwater by runoff of NOx species from agricultural land is a growing problem with increasingly negative consequences for public health. Among other technologies, denitrification of runoff streams via electrocatalysis is a promising solution, but a lack of fundamental insights into the relevant reaction mechanisms and a limited understanding of the molecular-level factors that control selectivity to desired products have hindered progress. Previous work suggests that, while Pt electrocatalysts produce primarily undesirable ammonium (NH4+) products from electrochemical NOx reduction at room temperature, addition of promoters such as Sn may tune the solution-phase product selectivity to yield a mixture of hydroxylamine (NH3OH+) and ammonium. To elucidate the atomic-scale features responsible for this significant selectivity shift, we investigate the reaction mechanism for NO electroreduction on Pt3Sn(111) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations combined with detailed treatments of surface ensemble, coverage, and solvation effects. High coverages of NO* on the catalyst surface (up to 5/9 ML) are explicitly considered to mimic experimental reaction conditions and to ascertain the effect of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reaction mechanism. Activation barriers for electrochemical reduction and N-O cleavage in adsorbed NO* and subsequent reaction intermediates, as well as chemical N-O bond breaking in similar species, are determined using a combination of transition state search algorithms and explicit electrochemical double-layer models. The resulting reaction free energy landscape highlights the importance of both interactions between the adsorbed reaction intermediates and NO* and solvation effects in promoting hydroxylamine production over ammonium on Pt-Sn alloys. Such effects lead to enhanced stability of the HNO* reaction intermediate, in comparison to pure Pt, and to its subsequent conversion to hydroxylamine. The results provide a compact interpretation of how Sn alters the product selectivity during NO electroreduction on Pt and point to design principles by which selectivity may be controlled in denitrification and related electrocatalytic processes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900027

The pseudohexagonal Ta2O5 (TT-Ta2O5) synthesized by a hydrothermal method showed the highest catalytic activity for CO oxidation as a support for gold catalysts. The temperature at 50% CO conversion was -11 degrees C for 1 wt % Au/TT-Ta2O5, and the temperature was 23 degrees C at 100% CO conversion (space velocity of 20000 mL h(-1 )g(cat)(-1)). To investigate the reaction mechanism, in situ performed, and the sequential delivery of adsorbed CO on Ta2O5 sites and Au sites to the active sites was observed at -120 degrees C. The results of temperature-programmed CO reduction suggested that the oxygen adsorbed at -100 degrees C contributed mainly to the high catalytic activity of CO oxidation, while the lattice oxygen played a minor role for CO oxidation from -60 to 100 degrees C, which was the same temperature range with the actual reaction condition.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900028

However, the determination and interpretation of the apparent activation energy in multistep reactions is not an easy task. For this purpose, concepts based on the definition of degree of rate control are convenient, which comprise mathematical approaches for analyzing reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics. Although these concepts have been used in catalysis, they have not yet been quantitatively applied in electrocatalytic systems, whose ability to control the potential across the solid/liquid interface is the main difference with heterogeneous catalysis, and the electrical current is commonly used as a measure of the reaction rate. Herein, we use the definitions of sensitivities and kinetic degree of rate control to address some of the drawbacks that frequently arise with interpreting apparent activation energy as a measure of intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of an electrode. For this, a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-like electrokinetic model is used for making numerical experiments and verifying the proposed ideas. The results show that, to improve the catalytic activity of an electrode material, one must act upon the reaction steps with the highest normalized electrochemical sensitivities. On the other hand, experiments at different applied voltages showed that if the electroactive surface poisoning processes take place, changes in E-app should be carefully used to compare the catalytic activity of the electrodes considering the effects by surface coverages. Finally, the importance of making measurements at steady-state to avoid difficulties in the calculations of apparent activation energy is also discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900029

Never-theless, these homogeneous methodologies typically necessitate the utilization of noble metal-based (e.g., Ir, Ru, etc.) photosensitizers. In contrast, solid-state semiconductors represent an attractive alternative but remain less explored for C-C bond-forming reactions driven by visible-light irradiation. Herein, we report that photocatalytic pinacol C-C coupling of benzaldehyde to hydrobenzoin can be achieved on two-dimensional ZnIn2S4 nanosheets upon visible-light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (e.g., triethylamine). We further demonstrate that it is feasible to take advantage of both excited electrons and holes in irradiated ZnIn2S4 for C-C coupling reactions in the absence of any sacrificial reagent if benzyl alcohol utilized as the starting substrate, maximizing the energy efficiency of photocatalysis and circumventing any byproducts. In this case, industrially important benzoin and deoxybenzoin are formed as the final products. More importantly, by judiciously tuning the photocatalytic conditions, we are able to produce either benzoin or deoxybenzoin with unprecedented high selectivity. The critical species during the photocatalytic process were systematically investigated with various scavengers. Finally, such a heterogeneous photocatalytic pinacol C-C coupling strategy was applied to produce a jet fuel precursor (e.g., hydrofuroin) from biomass-derived furanics (e.g., furfural and furfural alcohol), highlighting the promise of our approach in practical applications.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900030

These structures are dynamic and provide changes in the chemical environment and redox state of transition metal centers that result in drastic changes in the catalytic behavior. Inspired by these catalytic traits, porous polymers represent a versatile platform for preparing catalysts by anchoring metals to organic functional groups. Following this inspiration, we studied the structural evolution of a series of catalysts containing atomically dispersed Cu ions grafted onto imine-linked porous organic frameworks (IPOFs) during synthesis and reaction. Cu species were found to be bound to the imine or diiminopyridine units of IPOFs and to be active for oxidation of carbon monoxide. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (S) showed that the metal centers could gradually activate oxygen and change their oxidation state. Interestingly, depending on the type of functional group responsible for binding Cu, the active sites either reach a balanced redox turnover between Cu(I) and Cu(II) states or get poisoned by CO and locked at a Cu(I) state during reaction. Furthermore, samples with agglomerated Cu species were found to be redispersed upon contact with the reaction mixture, which promoted a high initial activity not seen in the original samples. Overall, our results show that catalytic sites in porous polymers can have very dynamic structures that are highly dependent on the polymer functional groups as well as reaction conditions and show how this strategy can be used to produce active catalysts with a wide range of possible compositions and chemistries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900031

Doped carbon-based materials offer a viable means for replacing Pt, but their activity improvement still remains a great challenge. Here, configurations of N-doped carbons are first analyzed using ab initio simulations toward ORR. The results show that a certain short-range ordered structure labeled as C-N2, which comprises of two nitrogen atoms flanking carbon, is the optimal choice. The predicted configuration of C-N2 is experimentally realized by triazine-doped carbon (triNC). The triNC with C-N2 sites demonstrates high ORR activity (onset potential 0.98 V, halfwave potential 0.89 V) comparable to commercial 20% Pt/C. The highly localized and positive-charged carbon atom in the C-N2 structure facilitates the dissociation of O-2 to increase the ORR kinetics, proved by theoretical calculation. A Zn-air cathode is fabricated using the triNC ORR electrocatalyst and outperforms the cathode using Pt/C in terms of specific capacity, energy density and long-term durability. The atomic-scale approach reported here provides a good strategy to achieve active carbon-based electrocatalysts for potential and scalable use in energy conversion and storage.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900032

We considered all relevant elementary reaction steps on Co(11 (2) over bar1) step-edge and Co(0001) terrace sites as well as such important aspects as coverage-related lateral interactions, different chaingrowth mechanisms, and the migration of adsorbed species between the two surfaces in the dual-site model. CHx-CHy coupling pathways relevant to the carbide mechanism have favorable barriers in comparison to the overall barriers for the CO insertion mechanism. A comparison of reaction barriers indicates why cobalt is such a good FT catalyst: CO bond scission and chain growth compete, while termination to olefins has a slightly higher barrier. The predicted kinetic parameters correspond well with experimental kinetic data. The Co(11 (2) over bar1) model surface is highly active and selective for the FT reaction. Adding terrace Co(0001) sites in a dual-site model approach leads to a substantially higher CH4 selectivity at the expense of the C2+-hydrocarbons selectivity. The chain-growth probability decreases with increasing temperature and H-2/CO ratio, caused by faster hydrogenation of the hydrocarbon chains. The elementary reaction steps for O removal and CO dissociation significantly control the overall CO consumption rate. Chain growth occurs almost exclusively at step-edge sites, while additional CH4 stems from CH and CH3 migration from step-edge to terrace sites. Replacing CO by CO, as the reactant shifts the product distribution nearly completely to CH4, which is related to the much higher H/CO coverage ratio during CO2 hydrogenation in comparison to CO hydrogenation. These findings highlight the importance of a proper balance of CO and H surface species during the FT reaction and pinpoint step-edge sites as the locus of the FT reaction with low-reactive terrace sites near step-edge sites being the origin of unwanted CH4.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900033

However, reports on deoxygenation of longer polyols (e.g., erythritol, xylitol, and sorbitol) to monoalkenes are scarce, especially when using H-2 as reducing agent. Here we design a conceptually different catalyst system for polyol conversion to olefins, containing a selective Ru hydrogenation function (e.g., RuBr3) in an ionic liquid that dehydrates alcohols (tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, Bu4PBr). This system performs HDO of erythritol to butenes in yields up to 69%. Strikingly, overreduction to less valuable butane is effectively suppressed. We show that in situ formed CO is crucial in the formation and stabilization of the active and selective catalyst. The actual hydrogenation catalyst is identified as a Ru carbonyl bromide species, as demonstrated by FTIR and XANES. Finally, we show that this HDO also works for more economically relevant polyols: glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol, leading to propene, pentenes, and hexenes as main products, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900034

By applying electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to compare hydrated, dehydrated, and NH3-saturated catalysts before and after hydrothermal aging, as well as density functional theory calculations, it is found that hydrothermal aging induces Cu relocation, leading to stronger Cu-support interactions. This is particularly evidenced by ZCuOH conversion to Z(2)Cu, which leads to the generation of a structure with two Cu(II) cations positioned in a double six-membered ring prism. These two Cu(II) ions have a separation of similar to 3.90 angstrom as derived by EPR analysis, which agrees well with our DFT-based model. The Cu(II) cations that do not undergo such dramatic changes also appear to stay closer to framework windows as evidenced by the overall increased anisotropy during EPR measurements. In situ EPR measurements under SCR conditions demonstrate that, in comparison to the fresh catalyst, a higher percentages of Cu species stay as Cu(II) in the aged catalyst. This suggests that the reduction half-cycle of the SCR redox, i.e., Cu(II) -> Cu(I), becomes slower for the hydrothermally aged catalyst.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900035

We report that A-site engineering of La1-xSrxFe0.8Al0.2O3 oxides significantly adjusts the oxygen capacity, which nearly triples from 1.0 mmol/g (x = 0.1) to 2.7 mmol/g (x = 0.5) with CO selectivity maintaining above 94%. Characterization results show that doping of Sr at the La-site induces dynamic crystal reconstruction from perovskite to Fe-0 and LanSrFen-xAlxO3n+1 (n = 1 and 2) oxides with Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) structure, possessing good methane activation and oxygen transport property, respectively. Spontaneously growth of RP oxides around Fe-0 rapidly delivers lattice oxygen from perovskite oxide to Fe-0. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that introduction of Sr notably reduces oxygen vacancy formation energy, leading to better oxygen donating ability. The synergy between dynamic structure evolution and oxygen mobility modulation greatly improves methane-to-syngas performance, which provides meaningful guidance to design advanced catalysts with better oxygen capacity for specific catalytic transformations.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900036

However, existing chemoenzymatic systems with more than one chemical reaction and one enzymatic reaction working cooperatively are rare. Moreover, the application of oxidoreductases in cooperative chemoenzymatic reactions is limited by the necessity of using expensive and unstable redox equivalents such as nicotinamide cofactors. Here, we report a light-driven cooperative chemoenzymatic system comprised of a photoinduced electron transfer reaction (PET) and a photosensitized energy transfer reaction (PEnT) with an enzymatic reduction in one-pot to synthesize chiral building blocks of bioactive compounds. As a proof of concept, ene-reductase was directly regenerated by PET in the absence of external cofactors. Meanwhile, enzymatic reduction worked cooperatively with photocatalyst-catalyzed energy transfer that continuously replenished the reactive isomer from the less reactive one. The whole system stereoconvergently reduced E/Z mixtures of alkenes to the enantiopure products. Additionally, enantioselective enzymatic reduction worked competitively with photocatalyst-catalyzed racemic background reaction and side reactions to channel the overall electron flow to the single enantiopure product. Such a light-driven cooperative chemoenzymatic system holds great potential for asymmetric synthesis using inexpensive petroleum or biomass-derived alkenes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900037

Here we demonstrate how a combination of machine learning and first-principles calculations can be used to extract knowledge from a relatively small set of experimental data. The approach is based on combining a complex machine-learning model trained on a computational library of transition-state energies with simple linear regression models of experimental catalytic activities and selectivities from the literature. Using the combined model, we identify the key C-C bond-scission reactions involved in ethanol reforming and perform a computational screening for ethanol reforming on monolayer bimetallic catalysts with architectures TM-Pt-Pt(111) and Pt-TM-Pt(111) (TM = 3d transition metals). The model also predicts four promising catalyst compositions for future experimental studies. The approach is not limited to ethanol reforming but is of general use for the interpretation of experimental observations as well as for the computational discovery of catalytic materials.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900038

These conclusions are first validated by experimental data on MIL-100(Fe)/MIL-100(Fe,Mn) and further used as guidelines to develop a ruthenium-based MIL-100 with even better catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900039

The robust charging reversibility of the redox metal sites ensures long-term durability of the devices but remains unachieved and usually ignored. Here, we use in situ UV-vis and Raman spectroscopies to track the redox states of a nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)(2) model catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during its lifetime in strong alkaline media. We show that at 200 mAcm(-2) in the 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the reversible redox states of the catalytically active Ni sites gradually disappear when the catalyst converts into an irreversible and inactive phase. We found that after deactivation, the complete reduction of such oxidized Ni sites can not be achieved until a very negative reduction potential around 0.1 V RHE was applied owing to the structural amorphization/disordering of the layered Ni(OH)(2) catalyst. Our results suggest that the deactivated and unreduced Ni sites hardly re-hydrate/re-hydroxylate and thus obstruct the OER process. These findings provide direct evidence for elucidation of the origin of the oxygen evolution decay and contribute to a reference to extend the lifetime of 2D-layered transition-metal hydroxide catalysts by stabilizing the reversible redox metal sites.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900040

The goal of this study is to optimize the catalytic efficiency of microgels by decreasing their particle size with surfactants that are custom-made for the respective prepolymerization mixture. The effectiveness of the approach is examined by evaluating the catalytic efficiency of the resulting microgels in comparison to their counterparts made in the presence of ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution. Spherical particles with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value dependent mean hydrodynamic diameters between 99 and 200 nm are obtained. Addition of Cu(II) ions and selected other transition metal ions activated the dormant catalysts for cleavage of glycosidic bonds in 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer at pH 7.00 and 37 degrees C using a fluorescent model substrate. The highest proficiency for the catalytic hydrolysis was observed for Cu(II)-containing microgels (K-cat/K-M x K-non = 870 000) with the lowest diameter indicating an almost twofold better stabilization of the transition state compared to a microgel prepared in the presence of ionic SDS solution. The study establishes a correlation of the HLB value of the nonionic surfactant blend used during material synthesis to the particle size and catalytic performance of the resulting microgels.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900041

Zeotypes are a class of microporous oxides whose lattices are substituted with metal heteroatoms, which serve as primary binding sites to catalyze a variety of chemical transformations including reductions, oxidations, and condensations. Research efforts continue to develop more complete mechanistic descriptions of catalytic behavior, requiring increasingly accurate descriptions of all moieties that comprise active centers. Framework metal heteroatoms adopt various local configurations that are difficult to control synthetically and are susceptible to restructuring during reaction. These binding sites contain structural and catalytic diversity even when they are located in the nominally simplest zeotype frameworks, as is typically the case for "model" heterogeneous catalyst materials of purportedly well-defined structure. Secondary environments are well-documented to influence catalysis via shape selectivity and confinement effects, yet their polarity, as defined by the oxide framework and any polar binding sites it contains (e.g., heteroatoms, hydroxyl groups), also influences the structures and Gibbs free energies of intermediates and transition states, as well as coadsorbed intraporous molecules, leading to further catalytic diversity. These three aspects that describe active centers at and beyond their binding sites must be accounted for in quantitative descriptions of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors that dictate catalysis over metal-containing zeotypes. Advances in describing the structural and catalytic diversity of these materials have required harnessing state of the art computational, spectroscopic, material synthesis, and chemical characterization methods. Herein, we outline opportunities to leverage experiment and theory to interrogate these aspects of active centers with increasing fidelity, to further advance molecular descriptions of catalysis over metal-containing zeotypes and broaden their range of catalytic behavior.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900043

Highly enantioselective construction of such quaternary carbon centers poses a singular challenge due to the steric repulsion between the four different carbon substituents. Herein, we report a novel strategy to control the enantioselective construction of chiral aquaternary alpha-ldehydes from racemic alpha-branched aldehydes. Distinct from the established chiral alpha-quaternary aldehyde synthesis, this project employed a chiral pi-allyl-Pd complex neighboring the enolate to determine both the enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The synthetic utility of the products has been highlighted by a series of derivatizations, and the potential of this method has been extended to the synthesis of chiral alpha-quaternary ketones. Furthermore, this reaction exemplifies the themes of step and atom economy, in addition to the principles of diversity-oriented synthesis.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900044

It is desirable to develop catalysts that perform well at low temperature and pressure (250-400 degrees C, <2 MPa). The main challenge of low-temperature NH3 synthesis is the dissociation of the extremely stable N N triple bond. Herein, we report the design of homogeneous single-atom Ru centers on an H-ZMS-5 (HZ) support with the Ru atoms individually anchored in the micropores of HZ, effectively boosting NH3 synthesis under mild conditions via an associative pathway. Synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and in situ DRIFTS analyses show that =N- groups are the primary intermediates, and DFT calculations further show that, unlike Ru nanoclusters, the cooperation of a single Ru atom and hydrogen species in HZ leads to N-2 hydrogenation rather than direct N-2 dissociation, and the indirect N-N bond dissociation occurs much more easily via the formation of the NHNH3* intermediate; the energy barrier for breaking the N-N bond keeps falling from 2.90 eV for *N-2 to 0.04 eV for *NHNH3, showing that N-2 hydrogenation is an effective way for sharp weakening of N-N bonds. Moreover, the rate-determining step is shifted from the dissociation of the N N triple bond to the formation of *N2H2. As a consequence, the single-atom 0.2 wt % Ru/H-ZSM-5 catalyst shows the highest NH3 synthesis rate per gram of Ru (1.26 mol(NH3) gRu(-1) h(-1) at 300 degrees C and 1 MPa) among the Ru-based catalysts ever reported.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900045

The HppE-catalyzed 1,2-phosphono-migration of (R)-1-HPP, which involves the pro-R hydrogen abstraction from C2, was proposed to proceed via the formation of a C2 carbocation intermediate. Here, we show that such an intermediate does not transpire during the reaction. The reorientation of the singly occupied orbital at the C2-radical center, through out-of-plane torsion of the P-C1-C2-C3 dihedral angle, triggers the phosphono-migration and precludes the attack of the Fe-bound OH on the C2 radical (hydroxylation) as well as the C2-O coupling (epoxidation). For the substrate (1R)-1-hydroxyl-2-aminopropyl phosphonate, the lone-pair electrons on the amino group enable a fast proton-coupled electron transfer process, wherein the proton transfer from the amino group to phosphonate is coupled to the electron transfer from the C2 radical to the iron center, leading to a C2-iminium cation rather than the phosphono-migration. Finally, the C2 iminium intermediate is converted to a ketone product and NH3. These results demonstrate that the alpha-heteroatom substituent is vital for the generation of the cationic species, as well as the selectivity control in the HppE-catalyzed reactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900047

Semilocal exchange correlation functionals are known to provide an incorrect adsorption site and overestimated adsorption energy for CO on Pt. We develop a simple first-principles correction for the adsorption energy of CO on Pt(111) and Pt(100) using the bond length of adsorbed CO as a descriptor. The energy correction, which increases in the order top < bridge < hollow site, is used to derive the surface stability diagram for CO adsorbed on 111 and 100 facets of Pt showing the thermodynamically stable CO configurations on the surface as a function of temperature and pressure. High coverage (theta > 0.5) configurations of CO on Pt(111) lead to the formation of superimposed hexagonal/quasi-hexagonal lattice of CO on the hexagonal Pt(111) layer from a systematic exploration of such structures. Non-hexagonal structures seen in vacuum and low temperature conditions, (root 3 x 3)rect-4CO and c(root 3 x 7)rect-SCO, are however only 5 meV/angstrom(2) less stable than the hexagonal lattice at a similar coverage. For Pt(100) at theta >= 0.75, the CO molecules adopt a one-dimensional coincidence lattice and we observe the formation of (n x 2) unit cells (n = 4, 6, 8) with (2n - 2) CO molecules in each cell on top/quasi-top and bridge/quasi-bridge positions creating a skewed hexagonal lattice to reduce CO-CO repulsion with increasing coverage. The computational results agree with the available experimental observations for Pt(111) and Pt(100). The integrated theoretical simulation and experimental observation provide structural data for the study of catalytic reactivity on Pt surfaces in reactions involving high CO pressures and suggest an approach for understanding the structure of CO molecules on other metal catalyst surfaces during the catalytic reactions involving a high pressure of CO.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900048

Strict legislation limits the sulfur content in fuels to ultralow levels, only achieved through harsh chemical methods that produce massive amounts of CO 2 . Bio-desulfurization represents a more environmentally friendly alternative, with the bacteria Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 eliminating sulfur from the most chemically recalcitrant organosulfur compounds through a set of reactions performed by four enzymes (DszA-D). Despite its potential, bio-desulfurization is still too slow for direct use in refineries. As such, there is an urgent need to develop faster enzymes for the 4S pathway. To help in this endeavor, we determine here the reaction mechanism of the rate-limiting enzyme DszB with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods and clarify the fine molecular requisites for efficient catalysis. The first and rate-limiting step of the reaction is the protonation of 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate by Cys27 with an activation barrier of 25.3 kcal.mol(-1) and follows an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, releasing the SO2 group and forming the Cys27 thiolate and the hydroxybiphenyl product. Cys27 and SO2 then react with a water molecule, completing the reactional cycle, and release sulfur as HSO3-. The rate-limiting step of the reaction was replicated for 21 different conformations of DszB, enabling the clear identification and quantification of the most relevant active-site preorganization requisites for the reaction to occur through low barriers. Finally, we rationally identified the residues that can be mutated to design much more efficient, oil refinery-competent DszB variants.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900049

In acid-catalyzed biomass conversions, water is a key reagent/byproduct that can induce leaching/poisoning of catalyst's acid species, a major problem toward catalyst recyclability and product purification. Thus, developing efficient water-tolerant solid acid catalysts is vital for viable biomass valorization. TiO2 is considered to be a promising water-tolerant solid acid catalyst for biomass conversions because of the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4+ sites, which are robust and less prone to leaching in the aqueous medium. Besides, the synergistic combination of TiO2 with redox metals (Ru, Pd, Ni, Cu, etc.) provides abundant bifunctional acid-redox sites, which exhibit a favorable catalytic role in the deoxygenation of biomass molecules to practically useful hydrocarbons. Therefore, this review provides an overview of recent progress toward TiO2-based water-tolerant acid catalysis for biomass conversion, with a focus on hydrothermal stability of TiO2, its acidity, and catalysts' synthesis methods. Various biomass conversions over TiO2-based catalysts, where water-tolerant acid sites or acid-redox dual sites show a significant catalytic effect, were discussed. Structure-activity relationships based on water-tolerant Lewis acidity of TiO2 were emphasized. We believe that this review will provide valuable information for developing efficient water-tolerant solid acid catalysts not only for biomass valorization but also for other challenging reactions in the aqueous medium.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900050

Two proposed mechanisms, dearomatization of pyridine catalyzed by cooperation of two copper(I) centers and by one copper(I), are calculated and analyzed. The results indicate that one copper(I) center is capable of catalyzing the dearomatization reaction. To achieve the dearomatization on one copper(I) center, the Cu-H addition "product" (derived from styrene insertion into Cu-H) undergoes 1,3-and 1,5-Cu migration on a benzylic ligand, facilitating the 1,2- and 1,4-dearomatization of pyridine. In the two metal-center mechanism, significant sterically repulsive interactions among the substituents on the ligands between the two metal fragments hindered the dearomatization process. The origin of selectivity between 1,2- and 1,4-dearomatization of pyridine has also been discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900051

In the first step, the Cu-catalyzed cyclopropanation of branched dienes generates vinylcyclopropanes in high yields, regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, albeit in modest cis/trans diastereoselectivity. The stereoconvergent nature of the subsequent Rh-catalyzed [5 + 2] cycloaddition with alkynes overrides this apparent limitation and affords preferentially one 7-membered ring out of the 8 or 16 possible stereoisomers that can be theoretically generated. The final regioselectivity and enantioselectivity are high in the majority of cases .

Nevertheless, choosing the appropriate experimental conditions and the use of CPI coupled with a simplified kinetic model allowed us to extract the lifetime of the species involved in substrate oxidation. These figures are usually elusive, even though there is a wide collection of hypotheses, guesses, and speculations in the literature. From our analysis, we defined a surface photocatalytic activity index The latter consists of the ratio between the surface-defined kinetic constant for substrate oxidation and surface recombination and is independent of other experimental conditions, such as irradiance and catalyst concentration.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900054

We present a mechanistic study of EDR over Rh catalyst based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis. Our results show that both the initial decomposition of C2H2OH and the later C-O bond formation are crucial steps on the reaction free energy landscape. The microkinetic model suggests that the alpha-dehydrogenation of ethanol is the rate-determining step, and the calculated reaction rate (r(H2)) is 8.23 x 10(3) s(-1). Moreover, factors behind catalyst deactivation were investigated and potential solutions were explored from both theoretical and experimental aspects. The results indicate that additional H-2 could potentially mitigate catalyst deactivation by methanation of coke deposited on the catalyst. These computational and experimental efforts further the understanding of the complicated catalytic process and inspire the rational design of EDR catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900055

Therefore, an accurate location of single atoms is essential for understanding the reaction mechanism and design of SACs anchored at 2D layered materials. However, the preparation of SACs with a precise location remains a great challenge. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation, characterization, and catalytic performance of SACs, focusing on single atoms anchored at 2D layered materials beyond graphene. These 2D materials include transitional metal dichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, and MXenes. Importantly, the topic of impurities is discussed because these can be present at an even higher percentage than the single atoms at 2D layered materials. A variety of electrochemical energy applications are discussed in which SACs have a crucial role, including water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. Finally, this review provides the latest applications and developments perspective of single metal atoms on 2D surfaces, which offers a unique opportunity to tune active sites and optimize the activity, selectivity, and stability of electrocatalysts.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900056

In this work, we demonstrate that isoprene can be efficiently produced via a hybrid bio/thermochemical process, combining the efficient fermentation of cellulosic sugars to mevalonolactone (MVL) with the acid-catalyzed MVL decarboxylation to isoprene. We report herein the thermochemical conversion of MVL to isoprene over inexpensive amorphous SiO2/Al2O3. A detailed investigation into the reaction conditions and the Si/AI ratio shows that isoprene formation is maximized over high-SiO2-content samples at mild temperatures (225-250 degrees C) that prevent its secondary oligomerization to alkylated aromatics and cyclic olefins. The highest isoprene yield is attained over SiO2/Al2O3 with 90 wt % SiO2 at 250 degrees C and 1.4 h(-1), corresponding to similar to 60% of the theoretical maximum. Acidity-performance correlations reveal the key role of Bronsted acidity in the reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900057

Nickel complexes serve as effective catalysts owing to their tendency to undergo facile oxidative addition and slow beta-hydride elimination, and their capability to access both two-electron and radical pathways. Two-component alkene functionalization reactions have achieved high chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivities by tethering one of the coupling partners to the alkene substrate. Three-component reactions, however, often incorporate directing groups to control the selectivity. Only a few examples of directing-group-free difunctionalizations of unactivated alkenes have been reported.

Since PALs and AEPs share essentially similar overall structures, we surmised that the S2 and S1' substrate-binding pockets immediately flanking the catalytic Si site constitute the major ligase activity determinants (LADs) that control the catalytic directionality of these enzymes. Here, we report the successful conversion of butelase-2 into butelase-1-like ligases based on the LAD hypothesis. We prepared 23 LAD mutants by mutating residues of the S2 pocket (LAD 1) and/or the S1' pocket (LAD2) of butelase-2 into homologous residues in PALs. These LAD mutants markedly diminished protease activity and increased ligase activity. In contrast, substituting 12 non-LAD residues to the corresponding residues in butelase-1 did not change their protease profiles. At physiological pH, mutations targeting both LADs resulted in shifting the catalytic directionality from 95% hydrolysis to >95% peptide ligation. This results in the engineering of efficient recombinant peptide ligases that were demonstrated to be useful for macrocyclization and site-specific labeling of bioactive peptides and proteins. Five high-resolution crystal structures of butelase-2 and its engineered mutants reveal subtle changes proximal to the catalytic Si site that account for the reversal in enzymatic activity. Computational simulations of enzyme-substrate complexes suggest how the S-acyl intermediate is positioned at the S2 site and the substrate orientated, controlling accessibility of either water or incoming nucleophiles from the prime-side (S1' site) of the catalytic center. Together, these features determine the catalytic directionality between hydrolysis and ligation in AEPs and PALs. Overall, this work validates the LAD hypothesis as a central guide for making peptide ligases from their corresponding widely available protease counterparts, to produce precision tools for exquisite site-specific conjugation and the biomanufacturing of biologics.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000072

Directed Evolution's Influence on Rapid Density Fluctuations Illustrates How Protein Dynamics Can Become Coupled to Chemistry								ACS CATALYSIS				10	15			8476	8484		10.1021/acscatal.0c01618				AUG 7 2020	2020	Protein engineering is a growing field with a variety of experimental techniques available for altering protein function. However, creating an enzyme de novo is still in its infancy, so far yielding enzymes of modest catalytic efficiency. In this study, a system of artificial retro-aldolase enzymes found to have chemistry coupled to protein dynamics was examined. The original design was created computationally, and this protein was then subjected to directed evolution to improve the initial low catalytic efficiency. We found that this re-engineering of the enzyme resulted in rapid density fluctuations throughout the enzyme being reshaped via alterations in the hydrogen bonding network. This work also led to the discovery of a second important motion which aids in the release of an intermediate product. These results provide compelling evidence that to engineer efficient protein catalysts, fast protein dynamics need to be considered in the design.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000041	33163256

In this work, we provide mechanistic insight into the framework methylation within H-ZSM-5 at high methanol loadings and varying acid site densities by means of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics simulations show that stable methanol clusters form in the zeolite pores, and these clusters commonly deprotonate the active site; however, the cluster size is dependent on the temperature and acid site density. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations give evidence that the barrier for methanol conversion is significantly affected by the neighborhood of an additional acid site, suggesting that cooperative effects influence methanol clustering and reactivity. The insights obtained are important steps in optimizing the catalyst and engineering the induction period of the methanol-to-hydrocarbon process.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000080	32923027

However, neither the location of Mg2+ in the structure of TrmD nor its role in the catalytic mechanism is known. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identify a plausible Me binding pocket within the active site of the enzyme, wherein the ion is coordinated by two aspartates and a glutamate. In this position, Mg2+ additionally interacts with the carboxylate of a methyl donor cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The computational results are validated by experimental mutation studies, which demonstrate the importance of the Mg2+-binding residues for the catalytic activity. The presence of Mg2+ in the binding pocket induces SAM to adopt a unique bent shape required for the methyl transfer activity and causes a structural reorganization of the active site. Quantum mechanical calculations show that the methyl transfer is energetically feasible only when Mg2+ is bound in the position revealed by the MD simulations, demonstrating that its function is to align the active site residues within the topological knot-fold in a geometry optimal for catalysis. The obtained insights provide the opportunity for developing a strategy of antibacterial drug discovery based on targeting of Mg2+-binding to TrmD.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000004	32904895

This work demonstrates an efficient targeted activation to C-OH, C-O-C, or C=C by engineering the structure of catalytic Pt sites, affording 2-methylfuran (2-MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), or 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PeD) as product in the hydroconversion of furfuryl alcohol. The catalytic Pt sites have been engineered as atomic Pt, coordination unsaturated Pt-Pt in atom-thick dispersion, or coordination unsaturated 3D Pt-Pt by tailoring the Pt dispersion (single atom, 2D cluster, or 3D cluster) on Mg and Al-containing layered double oxide (Mg(Al)O) support. The selective activation of C-OH, C-O-C, or C=C has been traced with the FT-IR spectra recorded surface reaction. On atomic Pt, C-O-H is easily activated, with the assistance of Mg(Al)O support, with O-terminal adsorption without affecting furan C-O and C=C. However, C=C in the furan ring is easier to be activated on coordination-unsaturated Pt-Pt in atom-thick dispersion, resulting in a step-by-step hydrogenation to generate THFA. On coordination-unsaturated 3D Pt-Pt, the hydrogenolysis of furan ring is favored, resulting in the cleavage of furan C-O to produce 1,2-PeD. Also, the Mg(Al)O supports derived from Mg and Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) here also play a key role in promoting the selectivity to 1,2-PeD by providing basic sites.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000001

This method allows the rapid synthesis of chiral benzyl alcohols in high yields and stereocontrol, despite its nontemplated nature. In a cascade activation consisting of an initial irradiation-induced radical C-H-bromination and a consecutive enantioconvergent hydroxylation, the iodoarene catalyst has a dual role. It initiates the radical bromination in its oxidized state through an in-situ-formed bromoiodane and in the second, Cu-catalyzed step, it acts as a chiral ligand. This work demonstrates the ability of a chiral aryl iodide catalyst acting both as an oxidant and as a chiral ligand in a highly enantioselective C-H-activating transformation. Furthermore, this concept presents an enantioconvergent hydroxylation with high selectivity using a synthetic catalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000002		
J	Moradzaman, Mozhgan; Mul, Guido								Infrared Analysis of Interfacial Phenomena during Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 over Polycrystalline Copper Electrodes								ACS CATALYSIS				10	15			8049	8057		10.1021/acscatal.0c02130				AUG 7 2020	2020	Using attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy and similar to 10 nm thick, sputtered Cu-films on single bounce Si-ATR-crystals, we have analyzed the electrochemical conversion of CO2 in 0.1 M NaOH/D2O solutions. By using cyclic voltammetry, transitions in the composition of dissolved and surface-adsorbed species could be identified. At a highly negative potential [more negative than -1.2 V (vs RHE)], the formation of OD- and D-2 is dominant, resulting in a relatively high concentration of dissolved carbonate, with a maximum IR intensity at , similar to 1410 cm(-1). When the potential is less negative than -1.2 V, spectroscopically resolved interconversion of carbonate (CO32-) to bicarbonate (D)CO(3)(- )is evident, explained by a decrease in the local pH. Furthermore, adsorbed carbonate can now be distinguished from dissolved carbonate due to the strongly potential-dependent peak position of adsorbed carbonate ranging from similar to 1510 to 1570 cm(-1). In the potential range of -1.2 to -0.5 V (vs RHE), using D2O, the recently proposed CO2-dimerradical-anion was observed, adsorbed on the polycrystalline copper film. We also assign a previously unresolved band at similar to 1610 cm(-1) to this species. The dimer disproportionates to adsorbed CO and CO32-, the latter being converted to bicarbonate by proton addition. Adsorbed CO is sensitive to a Stark shift, that is, a shift as a function of applied potential. Eventually, CO disappears, and the infrared signature of (dissolved) formate at similar to 1590 cm(-1) appears at similar to -0.5 V. We discuss the spectra and chemistry in detail, based on the reference spectra of carbonate, bicarbonate, and formate and using (CO2)-C-13 to substantiate the formation of the dimer intermediate. The results are discussed and compared to recent literature on infrared analysis of electrochemical reduction of CO2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000003

The simple Bi(OAc)(3)/chiral phosphoric acid catalytic system proves to be efficient in this method, delivering the desired chiral 3-allylisobenzofuran-1(3H)-ones in good yields (up to 99%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99.5:0.5 e.r.) under mild conditions. The large-scale reaction and diverse transformations of products to various scaffolds with potential biological activities render it more attractive. Moreover, the mechanism was preliminarily explored by control reactions, mass spectrometry, deuterium experiment, and DFT calculations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000005

The present reaction model involves 25 different species and a total of 86 elementary processes, including adsorptions, desorptions, surface chemical steps, and diffusions. The reaction network accounts for three different mechanisms for the reverse water-gas shift reaction and three different mechanisms for methanation. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the reverse water-gas shift reaction dominates the CO2 hydrogenation on Ni(111) with no evidence of methane formation. The reaction proceeds mainly through the redox route, with the carboxyl pathway also being active but to a lesser extent. Methane production is hindered by the H + CO -> HCO endothermicity and the prohibitive energy barrier for CO dissociation, implying CO desorption rather than evolution through the Sabatier reaction. A detailed comparison to earlier theoretical studies supporting the methanation reaction shows that some unreliable assumptions along with limited theoretical approaches biased the former conclusion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000006

This tries to ensure efficient and sustainable base chemical production, while also safeguarding human health and the environment. To this end, the development of novel, nontoxic, and effective catalytic systems that are capable of driving value-added chemical transformations in environmentally benign solvents (e.g., water) is highly desirable. Moreover, these new catalysts need to be metal-free, easy-to-prepare, and potentially recyclable. Carbon dots, which are relatively new carbon-based nanoparticles, fulfill all these requirements because of their outstanding physicochemical features and thus have emerged as promising nanocatalytic platforms. This Perspective highlights the recent advances in synthesis of carbon dots and their applications in organic catalysis and photocatalysis, with particular attention to green nonmetal-doped systems. Finally, forward-looking opportunities within this field are mentioned here.									19	2	0	0	5	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000007

The kinetic study revealed that a water content in OME1 as low as 0.21 wt % can significantly hamper the reaction rate. The apparent activation energy increased with the water ATR-IR concentration, but the frequency factor was more severely affected and decreased by an order of magnitude when the water concentration was doubled. With increasing water content, the chain growth mechanism shifted from competition between the direct insertion of TRI and the dissociation of TRI with formaldehyde incorporation, to reaction of TRI with water to form methylene glycol units which were inserted in the OME chain. The competition between water and the reactants for binding to the active sites of the zeolite was studied by means of modulated excitation attenuated total reflection infrared (ME-ATRIR) spectroscopy experiments. It demonstrated a competition for silanol sites and Bronsted acid sites (BAS) according to the binding affinity order OME1 > H2O > TRI. This trend was confirmed by a DFT study of the interaction of OME1, TRI, and H2O with BAS. Combined together, these results indicated that the presence of water inhibited the adsorption of TRI on the binding sites, which prevented OME growth. Hence, even very low levels of water must be controlled for an efficient catalytic process.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000008

Cyclic voltammetry at different concentrations of formic acid and different scan rates and pulsed voltammetry were used to obtain a deeper insight into the effect of formate coverage on the rate of the direct pathway. Pulsed voltammetry also provided information on the effect of the concentration of formic acid on the rate of the formation of adsorbed CO on Pt(100). At low to medium coverage, increasing formate coverage increases the rate of its direct oxidation, suggesting that decreasing the distance between neighboring bidentate-adsorbed formate favors its interconversion to and/or stabilizes monodentate formate (the reactive species). However, increasing the formate coverage beyond approximately 50% results in a decrease of the rate of the direct oxidation, probably because bidentate formate is too closely packed for its conversion to monodentate formate to be possible. Cyclic voltammetry at very high scan rates reveals the presence of an order- disorder phase transition within the bidentate formate adlayer on Pt(111) when the coverage approaches saturation. The dependence of the potential of the maximum rate of dehydration to adsorbed CO, and of the rate at the maximum, on the concentration of formic acid is in good agreement with predictions made for a mechanism, in which adsorbed CO is formed through the adsorption of formate followed by its reduction to adsorbed CO, thus confirming that monodentate-adsorbed formate is the last intermediate common to both the direct and indirect pathways.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000009

According to X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements, it was revealed that, during the CH4 combustion, the Pd nanoparticles existed on the Al2O3 support as a PdO phase, while the crystallinity of PdO depended on the Pd particle size. On the basis of X-ray diffraction XRD), amorphous PdO particles with a size of <7 nm exhibited low activity for CH4 combustion. In contrast, as the Pd particle size increased, larger crystalline PdO particles (>7 nm) were formed, which were highly active for CH4 combustion. Comparing the effects of the different Al(2)O(3 )crystalline phases, Pd/alpha-Al2O3 was proved to be more resistant to deactivation by H2O than Pd/gamma-Al(2)O(3 )and Pd/theta-Al2O3. Moreover, according to H2O temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and infrared (IR) measurements, since alpha-Al2O3 was relatively hydrophobic compared to gamma-Al2O3 and theta-Al2O3, a faster and reversible adsorption/desorption of OH/H2O species was achieved, while the H2O poisoning on PdO species in the vicinity was limited.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000012

It is a significant research challenge to find catalysts that can withstand water while delivering rates comparable to the dry PdO phase. Therefore, an in situ water sorption strategy could be advantageous in maintaining high rates for the reaction. Here, we investigate water sorbents that are used to remove the water produced by the reaction, which significantly enhances the activity of a Pd/CeO2 catalyst for methane combustion. The results reveal that the addition of zeolites or alumina to the Pd catalyst can transiently reduce the water concentration in the reactor and thus lead to increased catalytic rates. However, due to the limited number of sorption sites, hydroxylation of the PdO phase takes place rapidly, causing the catalyst to quickly exhibit the same activity as without the sorbent after a transient state. However, by using a stronger sorbent such as CaO mixed with the catalyst, it is possible to obtain higher catalytic activity that is maintained for longer periods of time. This latter system exhibits a 6-fold improvement in transient conversion of methane compared to that of the control catalyst. Meanwhile, long-term stability tests show catalytic activity higher than that without sorbent for extended periods of time. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that the number of adsorptive sites and the water sorption energy on the sorbents both influenced the water sorption efficiency. Although the sorbent needs to be regenerated, we envision this strategy being useful in conditions where regeneration can be performed without disruption of the catalytic performance. Overall, this work opens an avenue for promoting the methane combustion activity of catalysts by in situ water sorption.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000013

The reactions showed good functional group compatibility, proceeded well under mild conditions, and provided biaryls in yields of up to 96%. A wide range of useful functional groups, such as fluoro, chloro, ether, hydroxyl, amide, cyano, keto, trimethylsilyl (TMS), and ester were tolerated under the reaction conditions; however, the use of phenylboronic anhydride and arylboronic acid pinacol esters generally would lead low yields. Good regioselectivity for the electron-poor phenyl group was achieved when unsymmetrical diphenyl sulfoxides were used. The protocol is applicable at the gram scale even with half the amount of catalyst. Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, indicating that the reaction occurred through oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination to provide the final coupling product.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000014		
J	Biswas, Saborni; Kurtz, Donald M., Jr.; Montoya, Samuel R.; Hendrich, Michael P.; Bominaar, Emile L.								The Catalytic Role of a Conserved Tyrosine in Nitric Oxide-Reducing Non-heme Diiron Enzymes								ACS CATALYSIS				10	15			8177	8186		10.1021/acscatal.0c01884				AUG 7 2020	2020	Recent studies have identified several key intermediates of the nitric oxide reductase (NOR) cycle of flavodiiron proteins (FDPs). These intermediates include, sequentially, a mu-hydroxo diferrous species, a mono-NO intermediate, a di-NO intermediate (FDPdiNO), and a bis-mu-hydroxo diferric species. This paper focuses on the reaction path connecting the last two intermediates on which the nitrous oxide product is released. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, a reaction sequence is proposed in which the enzyme passes through an intermediate with a bridging hyponitrite ligand, which accepts a proton, initiating a rate-determining ligand rotation from an N/N-to an N/O-coordinated conformation. This rotation is facilitated by a second-sphere tyrosine residue, which provides a transient hydrogen bond to one of the nitrogen atoms of the substrate near the transition state. The role of the tyrosine residue in the NOR activity has been tested by steady-state kinetics and rapid freeze-quench (RFQ) studies of the Y197F variant of the FDP from T. maritima in which the hydrogen bonding interaction is absent. The Y197F variant displayed little or no steady-state NOR activity in support of the importance of Y197. The RFQ samples, monitored by Mossbauer spectroscopy, showed that Y197F follows the same reaction path as a wild-type FDP up to and including the formation of FDPdiNO but diverges subsequently with the variant forming an inactive mono-NO species. The RFQ results demonstrate that Y197 enables the postFDP(diNO) section of the reaction cycle in the wild-type FDP to proceed to N2O. The proposed refinement of the reaction mechanism provides an explanation for the lack of NOR activity of the variant Y197F of T. maritima and of other di-NO binding diiron enzymes and model compounds with active site structures like those of FDPs. The reported reductions of NO to N2O catalyzed by synthetic diiron complexes proceed only with the support of radiation, additional electrons, or an electron-rich ligand environment. However, higher potential diiron sites like those of FDPs require hydrogen bonding to second-sphere residues to turn over NO to N2O.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000015

This work elucidated the effect of different pretreatments on molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) to understand how surface reactivity is controlled by the surface oxidation state. The catalyst was pretreated in oxidative, inert, and reducing environments. The inert and reducing pretreatments created oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface that acted as active sites for the adsorption of oxygenated molecules, with the reducing pretreatment yielding a higher density of these active sites. Exposing the catalyst to an alcoholic solvent such as methanol also led to a partial reduction similar to the inert pretreatment. After pretreatment, the catalyst was exposed to ethanol, acetaldehyde, and crotonaldehyde with subsequent characterization by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Density functional theory (DFT) was also used to determine adsorption configurations and energies of ethanol, acetaldehyde, and crotonaldehyde. Reduced surfaces were shown to have a stronger affinity for carbonyls, leading to a higher activity for the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde and ethanol to C-4 molecules. Catalysts pretreated in an oxidative environment were completely inactive toward chemisorption and reaction of acetaldehyde.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000016

It is also a heavily used chemical in various industrial and agricultural applications, making it a toxic water pollutant worldwide. Catalytic reduction of ClO3- into Cl- by H-2 is of great interest to both emission control and water purification, but platinum group metal catalysts are either sluggish or severely inhibited by halide anions. Here, we report on the facile preparation, robust performance, and mechanistic investigation of a MoOx-Pd/C catalyst for aqueous ClO(3)(- )reduction. Under 1 atm H-2 and room temperature, the Na2MoO4 precursor is rapidly immobilized from aqueous solution onto Pd/C as a mixture of low-valent Mo oxides. The catalyst enables complete reduction of ClO3- in a wide concentration range (e.g., 1 mu M to 1 M) into Cl-. The addition of Mo to Pd/C not only enhances the catalytic activity by >55-fold, but also provides strong resistance to concentrated salts. To probe the reaction mechanisms, we conducted a series of kinetic measurements, microscopic and X-ray spectroscopic characterizations, sorption experiments, tests with other oxyanion substrates, and a comparative study using dissolved Mo species. The catalytic sites are the reduced MoOx species (primarily Mo-IV), showing selective and proton-assisted reactivity with ClO3-. This work demonstrates a great promise of using relatively abundant metals to expand the functionality of hydrogenation catalysts for environmental and energy applications.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000017

This is almost a dogma in the development of C-H activation reactions. Here we report a strategy to change this dogma, as we have found that a Pd-catalyzed, ligand-enabled remote gamma-alkylation of saturated aliphatic carboxamides can be realized in the presence of more accessible beta-C-H bonds by using strained bicyclic alkenes as the coupling partners. Density functional theory calculations and experiments suggested that the realization of the change in the regiodetermining step from commonly encountered irreversible C-H activations, which are reversible here, to an unexpected Pd migration process, which is regiodetermining. This is a new strategy to achieve gamma-C-H activation, compared with the previous strategy, making gamma-C-H activation both the turnover- and regiodetermining step.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000018

Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis with Liquid and Vapor Phase Tellurium								ACS CATALYSIS				10	15			8223	8230		10.1021/acscatal.0c00805				AUG 7 2020	2020	Methane pyrolysis transforms CH4 into hydrogen and solid carbon without a CO2 byproduct. Using a high-temperature liquid catalyst in a bubble column reactor, deactivation from coking is avoided and the solid carbon removed. As an element with high electron affinity, liquid tellurium is an active methane pyrolysis catalyst with an apparent activation energy of 166 kJ/mol. At the reaction temperature of approximately 1000 degrees C, Te has a high vapor pressure and the vapor is also found to be a catalyst with an apparent activation energy of 178 kJ/mol. Contrary to results obtained for other molten alloy catalysts, dissolving Ni in molten tellurium lowers the pyrolysis activity. Quantum mechanical calculations were performed with accurate methods for the gas-phase reaction, and with ab initio, constant-temperature, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with energies computed using density functional theory for the liquid phase.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000019

This reaction features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scopes, delivering a wide range of highly functionalized chiral amine derivatives. Mechanistic studies suggest that chiral lithium phosphate can serve as a pocket to accelerate the aggregation of enamide and RAE through hydrogen-bonding and coordination interaction, enabling the formation of a charge-transfer complex (CTC). Either enamide or CTC can be excited by direct irradiation or Ru(II)-mediated photosensitization to furnish chiral iminium intermediates for the asymmetric Friedel-Crafts reaction of indole.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000022

Cp* iridium Precatalysts for Selective C-H Oxidation via Direct Oxygen Insertion: A Joint Experimental/Computational Study. ACS Catal. 2012, 2, 208 218), in the present study, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations on another kind of an Ir-oxo complex, namely, [Ir-v(eta(5)-C5H5){bpy(COOH)(2)}(O)](2+) or OC, where bpy(COOH)(2) is 2,2'-bipyridine-4,4' dicarboxylic acid, to assess its ability to hydroxylate methane to methanol. OC is formed by light-induced oxidation of the Ir-H2O complex to generate electricity. By hydroxylating methane to methanol and inserting H2O, OC can regenerate the Ir-H2O complex and thus create a catalytic loop similar to a fuel cell. Herein, by utilizing intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) analysis, we show detailed mechanisms of how OC efficiently cleaves the strong C-H bond of methane to form methanol in three possible spin states, namely, the triplet, open-shell singlet, and closed-shell singlet states. In the triplet state, the C-H bond cleavage proceeds with an activation energy of only 11.3 kcal/mol via a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, where an intermediate species involving (CH3)-C-center dot and Ir-OH center dot is formed in the same spin state, although a spin change to the open-shell singlet state is likely to occur. A subsequent HO-CH3 recombination occurs without a barrier through direct radical coupling in the open-shell singlet state. In contrast, the C-H bond cleavage in the closed-shell singlet state occurs via a hydride transfer (or oxygen insertion) mechanism, where methanol is directly formed without any intermediate states. Although this reaction mechanism requires a lower C-H activation energy (5.6 kcal/mol), OC in the closed-shell singlet state is less stable by 11.9 kcal/mol than that in the triplet state. These results provide a theoretical prediction of an alternative promising catalyst for the direct conversion of methane to methanol and the methane fuel cell.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000023

In suitable materials, these changes favor the cyclic production of synthesis gas. Advanced study of these properties is of prime importance when strengthening the material selection criteria for thermochemical applications. Considering this, we investigate the redox behavior of LaxSr1-xMnO3 (LSM) perovskite oxide systems during dry and steam chemical looping reforming of methane. The durability and structural stability are studied for cyclic regeneration to the parent perovskite structure. It is observed that lanthanum addition suppresses the LSM structural disintegration during the reduction reaction and promotes its regeneration upon reoxidation. High syngas yields of up to 2.7 mmol g(-1) are produced with 25% lanthanum content during 30 consecutive cycles of dry reforming of methane. H-2 purity is also increased by up to 18% in lanthanum-rich LSM structures when compared to pure SrMn0 3 with similar to 74% H-2 purity. It is found that despite structural disintegration, manganese plays an active role in redox activities and its oxidation state is greatly influenced by lanthanum concentration and oxidation medium. We think that this study will supplement the in-depth investigation of the material's physiochemical properties before and after the redox reactions prior to selection of a suitable oxygen carrier/catalyst.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000024

Even more effective are bimetallic NiCu nanoparticles, which can provide a remarkable photocatalytic H-2 evolution enhancement compared to single-element Cu or Ni systems. The main concern of such alloyed co-catalysts is their activity with respect to alteration of their elemental composition and oxidation state over reaction time. Ex situ characterization techniques provide controversial interpretations of the co-catalytic role of the individual elements. Hypotheses such as the in situ reduction of "native" Ni or Cu species during photocatalysis, the oxidation of metallic Cu or Ni into oxides or hydroxides, or the formation of p-n junctions or core/shell structures have been proposed. Herein, we present an operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of a NiCu-TiO2 system under UV light illumination in ethanol-water solutions, i.e., under photocatalytic H-2 evolution conditions. The experimental approach allows for monitoring in real time chemical changes that take place in the co-catalyst under intermittent illumination, i.e., under light on-off cycles. We show that while Ni and Cu are partially oxidized in the as-formed NiCu co-catalyst (air-formed surface oxides or hydroxides) and undergo partial dissolution in the liquid phase under dark conditions, such Ni and Cu oxidized and dissolved species are reduced/redeposited as a bimetallic NiCu phase at the TiO2 surface under illumination. The dissolution/redeposition mechanism is triggered by TiO2 conduction band electrons. We not only prove a UV-light-induced healing of the NiCu co-catalyst but also unambiguously demonstrate that the species responsible for the strongly enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution of NiCu nanoparticles are the metallic states of Ni and Cu.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000027

Tandem catalysis that integrates the activation of CO or CO2 to an intermediate and the subsequent controllable C-C bond formation to form lower olefins offers a promising approach. Here, we report the hydrogenation of both CO and CO2 over bifunctional catalysts composed of a spinel binary metal oxide and SAPO-34. ZnAl2O4/SAPO-34 and ZnGa2O4/SAPO-34 are found to be highly selective for the synthesis of lower olefins from both CO and CO2. Our studies reveal that the oxygen vacancy site on metal oxides plays a pivotal role in the adsorption and activation of CO or CO2, while the -Zn-O- domain accounts for H-2 activation. We demonstrate that methanol and dimethyl ether formed on metal oxide are the reaction intermediates, which are subsequently converted to lower olefins by the Bronsted acid sites in zeolite. The hydrogenation of CO and CO(2 )on metal oxide surfaces proceeds via the same formate and methoxide species. We elucidate that the water-gas shift reaction on oxide surfaces is responsible for CO2 formation during syngas conversion. The cofeeding of CO2 in syngas offers a useful strategy to inhibit CO2 formation.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000028

Our study combines dassical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of different models for the enzyme-substrate complex and a detailed exploration of the reaction mechanism for the most plausible model using hybrid quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics techniques. Different enzyme-substrate models were built considering that the nucleophile in charge of the initial attack to the substrate could either be a water molecule or a hydroxide anion bridging between the two manganese(II) cations present in the active site. In contrast, for the substrate, we considered four different possibilities: one with the guanidino group of the substrate protonated and three of them where this group is neutral. In this last case, we considered two different tautomeric states and two possible coordination modes with the divalent ions. Our MD simulations revealed that the most stable complexes correspond to those having a hydroxide anion as the nucleophile, while both a protonated and a neutral form of the guanidino group can bind into the active site. Our analysis of the potential energy surface reveals a complex reaction pathway, where the initial attack of the nucleophile is followed by the inversion of the epsilon nitrogen atom of the guanidino group. It produces a reaction intermediate, stabilized by means of an H-pi interaction with a histidine residue, that shows high structural similitude with some of the most potent inhibitors known for HARGI (those derived from the 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid). Subsequently, a proton is transferred from the nucleophile to the leaving group via Asp128. The final step corresponds to the separation of the two reaction fragments: L-ornithine and urea. Our analysis is shown to be robust by comparison among the results obtained with different initial structures and functionals and also because of the good agreement with the experimental estimations of the activation energy and with mutagenesis analysis. Finally, the analysis of the electronic distribution demonstrates that manganese ions are not involved in charge-transfer processes during the reaction pathway, playing a structural and electrostatic role to stabilize the nucleophile and intermediate states of the reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000030

Synthetic approaches to functionalized steroids are important for generating steroidal agents for drug screening and development. However, chemical activation is challenging because of the predominance of inert, aliphatic C-H bonds in steroids. Here, we report the engineering of the stable, highly active bacterial cytochrome P450 enzyme P450BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium for the mono- and dihydroxylation of androstenedione (AD), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone (TST). In order to design altered steroid binding orientations, we compared the structure of wild type P450BM3 with the steroid C19-demethylase CYP19A1 with AD bound within its active site and identified regions of the I helix and the beta 4 strand that blocked this binding orientation in P450BM3. Scanning glycine mutagenesis across 11 residues in these two regions led to steroid oxidation products not previously reported for P450BM3. Combining these glycine mutations in a second round of mutagenesis led to a small library of P450BM3 variants capable of selective (up to 97%) oxidation of AD, DHEA, and TST at the widest range of positions (C1, C2, C6, C7, C15, and C16) by a bacterial P450 enzyme. Computational docking of these steroids into molecular dynamics simulated structures of selective P450BM3 variants suggested crucial roles of glycine mutations in enabling different binding orientations from the wild type, including one that closely resembled that of AD in CYP19A1, while other mutations fine-tuned the product selectivity. This approach of designing mutations by taking inspiration from nature can be applied to other substrates and enzymes for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000031

This has inspired the construction of artificial catalysts by the attachment of functional groups onto molecular scaffolds or solid supports to induce synergistic interactions. Herein, the transphosphorylation reaction is used as a model to demonstrate that cooperativity can also occur intermolecularly between multiple functional groups within self-assembled vesicular structures. We demonstrate that the modular and dynamic nature of such systems allow for triggered reorganization and the up- or down-regulation of catalytic activity. Such concepts have the potential to be used in the design of synergistic catalysts and their incorporation into responsive catalytic systems in water.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000033

Here, we report the use of a nonacidic MFI zeolite support, containing excess K+ beyond ion exchange capacity, well-dispersed Pt, and high Pt presence inside the pores, to maximize direct n-alkane aromatization selectivity. TGA, catalyst deactivation studies, and characterizations show that the smaller pore sizes and lack of large cages in the MFI support sterically inhibit coke formation inside the pores (0% in comparison to 4.9% over Pt/KL for n-octane aromatization), which also reduces dealkylation of ethylbenzene and o-xylene under mild conditions to give a more selective product distribution: 86% selectivity by weight toward C6 ring closure in comparison to 27% for Pt/KL. Additionally, using NH3-TPD, XPS, CO-DRIFTS, and STEM, we show the contribution of excess K+ as an inhibitor of strong acid sites, an indirect Pt electron promoter through improving metal-support interactions, and Pt dispersant. This work highlights the alternative use of well-understood zeolitic supports for the highly selective aromatization of n-heptane and n-octane by 1,6-ring closure, increasing the number of potential streams that can undergo direct aromatization and providing a suitable alternative to Pt/KL.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000037

How enzymes work and achieve their catalytic efficiency are some of the fundamental questions of life. Most studies have focused on specific enzymes to elucidate their reaction mechanisms and rate acceleration. No study, to our knowledge, has performed systematic analyses of the available properties of all six classes of enzymes. Here, we have systematically analyzed three parameters pertinent to enzyme catalysis, viz. activation free energy, substrate-binding free energy, and enzyme efficiency, which were estimated using the turnover number and the K-M value at a given temperature for each enzyme. By correlating these parameters with structural/biological information, including the presence/absence of inorganic and/or organic cofactors, the enzyme's oligomerization state, the monomer size, the cellular location, and the substrate specificity/promiscuity, we show that, despite the chemical, structural, and reaction diversity of the enzymes analyzed, the activation free energies, substrate-binding free energies, and enzyme efficiencies of most enzymes fall in a very characteristic narrow range of values. Various strategies are used by enzymes to confine the values of the catalytic parameters to such a narrow range. These include their location, their monomeric size or oligomeric state, their specificity, the environmental conditions, and the use of cofactors.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000038

The reported activating mechanism of the a-isomer was shown to require the initial formation of a transient C-1-O-2-C-2 epoxide that subsequently undergoes transformation to levoglucosan. Density functional theory results from maltose, a model compound for the alpha-isomer, show that the intramolecular C-2 hydroxyl group favorably interacts with lone pair electrons on the ether oxygen atom of an alpha-glycosidic bond in a manner similar to the hydroxymethyl (C-6 hydroxyl) group interacting with the lone pair electrons on the ether oxygen atom of a beta glycosidic bond. This mechanism has an activation energy of 219 kJ mol(-1), which is similar to the barriers reported for noncatalytic transglycosylation mechanism similar to 209 kJ mol(-1)) and in good agreement with experimentally measured barriers for a-cyclodextrin conversion at high temperatures. The results help explain the lack of sensitivity of depolymerization kinetics to glycosidic bond stereochemistry. Subsequent constrained ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that vicinal hydroxyl groups in the condensed environment of a reacting carbohydrate melt anchor transition states via two-to-three hydrogen bonds and lead to lower free energy barriers (similar to 134-155 kJ mol(-1)) in agreement with previous experiments.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000039

The photocatalyst efficiency of lignocellulose conversion is typically limited by the buffering redox system in combination with oxidation and reduction of the photoexcited holes and electrons, respectively, which ensures high charge-recombination rates. Herein, Ag+-exchanged CdS is employed for easy photoexcited electron transfer to the oxidized intermediate, which results in a marked increase in the conversion yield with high product selectivity under mild reaction conditions without any additives. The conversion yield of the lignin model compound under 6 W blue LED illumination is nearly 100% and only cleaved aromatic compounds are formed. The efficient photoredox CdS catalyst obtained via photoexcited electron-hole coupled transfer derived from an appropriate Ag+ exchange affords a promising method for lignocellulose conversion with reduced energy consumption.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000040

One of the key reasons for this poor operando durability is the surface oxidation of carbonaceous supports via Fenton(-like) reactions between the Fe centers and the intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an acidic medium, H2O2. In the present study, we have investigated the pH effect on the chemical deactivation of Fe-N-C catalysts by contacting them with a controlled amount of H2O2. Covering the entire pH range 0-14, we reveal a strong pH dependence of the H2O2-induced deactivation. Especially, acidic H2O2 treatment leads to a severe decrease in ORR activity while almost negligible deactivation is found after a treatment in a sufficiently strong alkaline electrolyte. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study reveals a positive correlation between the magnitude of Fe-N-C activity decrease and the signal intensity of the hydroxyl radical spin adduct after H2O2 treatment at a given pH. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as the hydroxyl radical is identified as a key deactivating agent of Fe-N-C catalysts operating from acidic to neutral pH environments. This result suggests that controlling the formation and lifetime of ROS at such pH is crucial to secure durable fuel cell operation with Fe-N-C cathodes. Alternatively, fuel cell operation under highly alkaline environment could also be considered to improve the catalytic durability, by virtue of a different Fenton(-like) reaction pathway at such pH.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000042

However, the presence of a surfactant shell on the catalyst is detrimental, as the resulting performance of the electrocatalyst depends crucially on the ability of reactants to access active surface sites. Techniques for postsynthesis deprotection are therefore mandatory for removing the capping agents from the otherwise blocked reactions sites without compromising the structural integrity of the nanocatalysts. Herein, we present silver nanowires (Ag-NWs)-produced via PVP-assisted polyol synthesis (PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone)-as effective catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ec-CO2RR), which reach Faradaic efficiencies close to 100% for CO formation after deprotection by a so-called "electrochemical looping" (ec-l) pretreatment. Electrochemical looping refers to a sequence of potentiostatic CO2 electrolysis experiments that exhibit well-defined starting (E-start), vertex (E-vertex), and end (E-end) potentials. The resulting product distribution undergoes a profound hysteresis in the forward and corresponding backward run of the electrochemical looping experiment, thus pointing to an effective deprotection of the catalyst as made evident by postelectrolysis XPS inspection. These results can be considered as a prime example demonstrating the importance of the catalyst's "history" for the resulting ec-CO2RR performance. These transient (non-steady-state) effects are crucial in particular for the initial stage of the CO2 electrolysis reaction and for catalyst screening approaches carried out on the time scale of hours.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000044

Here, we show that Au-sites in Au/TiO2 surprisingly become blocked upon treatment in common alcohols (2-propanol and methanol), with 2-propanol causing a greater extent of blockage. Nearly 95% of Au-sites are covered after treatment in 2-propanol at room temperature, followed by desorption at 150 degrees C. Infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption unambiguously confirms the occurrence of this phenomenon. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Raman spectroscopy, and DFT simulations suggest that the formation of carbon deposits from 2-propanol decomposition and/or the migration of a TiOx layer over the supported NPs may be responsible for the blockage of Au-sites. Nearly full coverage of Au NPs after treatment in 2-propanol led to negligible activity for catalytic CO oxidation, whereas partial retraction of the overlayer led to enhanced activity with time-on-stream, suggesting a self-activating catalytic performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000045

Herein, a heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate was developed by coordinating the mononuclear Ru3+ center (Ru hereafter) with a N,P-containing polymer, which was synthesized from phosphonitrilic chloride trimer and 2,6-diaminopyridine. Multiple nitrogen functionalities in the polymer (N content: 25.9 wt %) containing pyridine nitrogen and phosphazene nitrogen not only provided an electron-rich coordination environment for stabilizing mononuclear Ru center but also facilitated CO2 conversion by interacting with CO2 molecules. The polymer-coordinated mononuclear Ru catalysts (Ru/p-dop-POMs) could promote the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate with a turnover number (TON) up to 25.4 x 10(3) in aqueous solutions, and the concentration of formate in the solution could reach 3.4 mol/L. DFT calculations revealed that the electron-rich mononuclear Ru site could promote H-2 dissociation, which is the rate-determining step in the reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Systemic studies demonstrated that the synergistic effect between individually electron-rich Ru centers and nitrogen-rich polymer enhanced catalytic efficiency.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000050

Controlled surface reactions were used to synthesize these bimetallic nanoparticles on both TiO2 and SiO2 supports. Chemisorption measurements of the bimetallic catalysts indicate that Pd prefers to be on the nanoparticle surface with a Cu parent catalyst, while Pd prefers to be subsurface with a Ag parent catalyst. From energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, the composition of the nanoparticles is determined to be more uniform on the SiO2 support compared to that on the TiO2 support. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results indicate that, after reduction, the CuPd bimetallic catalysts have some Pd-Pd bonds, but the average number of Pd-Pd bonds decreases after reaction. Infrared spectra of the adsorbed CO show that an increased fraction of isolated Pd species are present on the bimetallic catalysts compared to those on the monometallic catalysts. Adsorption of acetylene and ethylene, however, indicates adsorbed surface species that require contiguous Pd ensembles. These results suggest that the surface structure of the catalyst is highly dynamic and influenced by the gas environment, as well as the support. The catalysts are active for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in an ethylene-rich environment under mild conditions. Over all catalysts, the ethylene selectivity is greater than 92%; however, improved selectivity is observed over the bimetallic catalysts compared to that over the monometallic Pd catalysts. An ethylene selectivity of 100% is observed over the CuPd0.08/TiO2 catalyst. The highest acetylene conversion rate per gram of Pd is observed over the CuPd0.02/TiO2 catalyst, while the highest turnover frequency is found over the AgPd0.64/TiO2 catalyst. The bimetallic SiO2-supported catalysts have lower rates than Pd/SiO2 but still show improved selectivity. The combined characterization measurements and reaction kinetics studies indicate that the performance improvements of the bimetallic catalysts may be attributed to both electronic and geometric modifications of Pd by the parent Cu or Ag metal.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000051

Upon light irradiation, the peroxide serves as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent to activate stable C(sp(3))-H bonds for the reaction with a broad range of nitrogen nucleophiles. The method enables the chemoselective alkylation of amides and is utilized for the late-stage functionalization of N-H bond containing pharmaceuticals with good to excellent yields. The mechanism of the reaction was preliminarily investigated by radical trapping experiments and spectroscopic methods.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000052

Despite intense interest, the catalytic mechanism of MGATS is not known in detail, precluding therapeutic exploitation. We solved structures of MGATS complexed to glycosyl donor and acceptor ligands, revealing an unforeseen role for donor-induced loop rearrangements in controlling acceptor substrate engagement. QM/ MM metadynamics simulations of MGATS catalysis highlight the key assisting role of G1u297 and reveal considerable conformational distortions imposed upon the glycosyl donor during transfer. Detailed mechanistic characterization of MGATS will aid inhibitor development to correct cancer-associated N-glycosylation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000053

While physical and spectral characterizations fail to obtain most of these details because of interference from the electrolyte and dynamic surface structures under reaction conditions, electrochemical measurements instead are able to provide the most direct information. A thermodynamic-kinetic model was developed in our previous work, which showed great capability to extract the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates through the Tafel plot without considering the exact structures of catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a more adaptive model in combination with probing the methanol oxidation reaction was developed. This approach offers the following advantages: From the aspect of thermodynamics, an experimentally rationalized adsorption profile could be obtained without the requirement to know the scaling factors of reactive intermediates. From the aspect of surface structure, the potential induced change of intermediates' coverage in the reaction could be described with high sensitivity. From the aspect of kinetics, multiple Tafel slopes in a single Tafel plot could be explained by potential induced variation in intermediates' coverage and activation energy in the ratedetermining step (RDS). A volcano relation between the symmetry factor and adsorption energy was also discerned and discussed, showing the strong correlation between thermodynamics and kinetics. Our model offers a promising analyzing tool by providing essential information on the electrochemical interface and both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of catalysts, which are important for the design of next-generation high-performance catalysts for multistep electrochemical reactions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000054

In the last two decades, replication of the reactivity of non-heme iron oxygenases has become feasible even with simple coordination complexes of iron and manganese. A bonafide minimalistic functional model was the tetradentate-N4 ligand based iron complex [Fe(tpa)(CH3CN)(2)](2+)(Fe(tpa), tpa = tris(2-methylpyridyl)amine which activates H2O2 via a mechanism that mirrors key steps of enzymatic O-2 activation processes at mononuclear iron centers: controlled O-O bond cleavage, generation of a high-valent Fe=O oxidant, and promotion of almost the full spectrum of its oxidative reactivity (C-H hydroxylation, olefin epoxidation, syn-dihydroxylation, and desaturation). These landmark discoveries set the mechanistic framework to use iron coordination complexes with nitrogen-rich ligands as catalysts for oxidizing organic substrates under synthetically relevant conditions. Due to proof-of-concept demonstrations of the potential of these catalysts in organic synthesis, this chemistry has flourished over the past decade. In parallel to the realization of the potential of this class of catalysts in diverse organic transformations, effort has been spent to manipulate the catalyst structure with the aim of tuning both the reactivity and selectivity of the oxidation reactions. This perspective provides an overview of the progress of this research. Some key features of the archetypical Fe(tpa) catalyst have stayed surprisingly true throughout this evolution, but a series of alterations that modulate its electronic, steric, or binding properties allowed a rational elicitation of a specific reactivity or selectivity. In some cases, the replacement of iron by manganese has also proven beneficial. Overall, the rational optimization of the catalyst structure has enabled the development of highly asymmetric olefin epoxidation, syn-dihydroxylation, and site-selective and even enantioselective C-H oxidation reactions.									24	1	0	0	4	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000055

However, the underlying mechanism and contribution of interfacial/surface phenomena behind the pulsed potential application remain largely unknown. We investigated the state of the copper surface during the pulsed potential electrochemical CO2R using in situ X-ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES). We probed the surface valence of the metallic electrode and found that the Cu electrode remains metallic over a broad pulsed potential range and only oxidizes to form Cu(OH)(2) in the bulk when the pulsed potential reaches the highly oxidative limit (greater than 0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Our results suggest that the pulsed anodic potential influences the interfacial species on the electrode surface, i.e., the dynamic competition between protons and hydroxide adsorbates instead of bulk copper oxidation. We attribute the suppressed HER to the electroadsorption of hydroxides, which outcompetes protons for surface sites. As shown in a recent in situ infrared study [Iijima, G. et al.; ACS Catalysis 2019, 9, 6305], adsorbed hydroxides promote CO adsorption, a crucial CO2 reduction intermediate, by preventing CO from becoming inert through a near-neighbor effect. We corroborate this interpretation by demonstrating that the pulsed potential application can suppress the HER during the CO reduction just as the CO2R. Our results suggest that the pulsed potential mechanism favors CO2R over the HER due to two effects: (1) proton desorption/displacement during the anodic potential and (2) the accumulation of OHads, creating a higher pH-surface environment, promoting CO adsorption. We can describe this pulsed potential dynamic interfacial mechanism in a competing quaternary Langmuir isotherm model. The insights from this investigation have wide-ranging implications for applying pulsed potential profiles to improve other electrochemical reactions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000056

The iron-catalyzed reaction proceeded with predictable regioselectivity, engaging sterically accessible C-H bonds including orthoto-fluorine sites. The site selectivity for the catalytic HIE reaction was studied to identify the kinetic preferences for C-H activation. Structure- activity relationship studies with a series of iron precatalysts established that introduction of substituents at the 3- and S-positions of pyridine of the pincer significantly accelerated HIE. Mechanistic studies identified N-2 as an inhibitor of C-H activation, while H-2 served to generate the active catalyst.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000057

Nevertheless, it has often been reported that C-alpha-oxidation, rather than ether bond cleavage, is the main result of LMS treatments, which limits the overall efficiency and effectiveness. Remarkably few studies have attempted to influence this product profile and thereby enhance the effectivity of LMS-catalyzed lignin degradation. Here, we studied the influence of buffer properties on the product profile of a beta-O-4' linked lignin model dimer upon conversion by a laccase/hydroxybenzotriazole system. We show that the ratio between beta-O-4' ether cleavage and C a -oxidation can be substantially increased by using unconventional buffer properties (i.e., highly concentrated buffers at near-neutral pH). Whereas <10% ether cleavage was obtained in conventional buffer (i.e., weak buffer at pH 4), as much as 80% ether cleavage was obtained in highly concentrated buffers at pH 6. In addition, this alteration of buffer properties was found to improve the stability of both laccase and mediator. The underlying reactions were further studied by using experimental and computational (density functional theory, DFT) approaches. Based on the outcomes, we propose detailed reaction mechanisms for the reactions underlying ether cleavage and C-alpha-oxidation. We propose that increasing buffer pH or increasing buffer strength enhances H-bonding between the lignin model and buffer anions, which drives the overall reaction outcome toward ether cleavage. These insights may pave the way for more efficient and effective biocatalytic lignin degradation.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000059

The resulting Na-promoted CoFe2O4 catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes (Na-CoFe2O4/CNT) exhibited high CO2 conversion (similar to 34%) and light olefin selectivity (similar to 39%), outperforming other reported Fe-based catalysts under similar reaction conditions. Their performance was superior to that of single-metal NP catalysts (Na-Fe3O4/CNT and Na-Co/CNT) and a physically mixed (Na-Fe3O(4) + Co)/CNT catalyst. The superior performance of the Na-CoFe2O4/CNT catalyst can be attributed to the facile formation of a unique bimetallic alloy carbide (Fe1-xCox)(5)C-2, which results in higher CO2 conversion and better selectivity toward light olefins in comparison with conventional chi-Fe5C2 active sites derived from Fe-only catalysts and significantly improved heavy hydrocarbon (C2+) formation in comparison with the Co2C sites of Co-only catalysts. The single-source precursor CoFe2O4 exclusively forms a single-phase alloy carbide promoted by the Na promoter, whereas the mixed (Na-Fe3O4 + Co) precursor forms an isolated Co phase with the alloy carbide phase, promoting undesirable CH4 formation. An optimal value of x <= 0.2 for (Fe1-xCox)(5)C-2 was predicted using the cluster expansion method and density functional theory, resulting in a stable bimetallic alloy structure.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000060

The catalysts fabricated with different templates presented different Co dispersities, leading to distinguishing catalytic performance. The optimized Co-1@NC-(SBA) catalyst with atomically dispersed Co displayed outstanding catalytic activity for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived species as well as the hydrogenation of various nitroaromatics. The reaction mechanism of the HDO of vanillin was investigated by using density functional theory calculations as well.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000061

Photocatalytic approaches have attracted widespread attention as promising options to turn pollutants into environmentally benign end products under favorable operating conditions. Although most approaches rely on the titanium dioxide (TiO2) structures, many other engineered photocatalytic materials can also be used to enhance overall efficiency and practicality of such systems. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the available options for discrete mitigation of NH3 in gaseous and aqueous matrixes. The performances of photocatalytic materials and systems are compared with respect to quantum and space-time yields. Special attention has been paid to the reaction mechanisms prevalent during photocatalytic removal of NH3 in each medium coupled with the production of end products (e.g., hydrogen and nitrogen) through NH3 splitting. The effects of process and operational variables (e.g., irradiation time, relative humidity, mode of operation, and environmental matrix type) on performance are also discussed along with the intrinsic properties of the applied materials (e.g., surface functional sites and structure). Existing obstacles, such as the formation of hazardous byproducts through complicated reaction pathways, are explored along with future challenges.									18	0	0	0	5	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000062

The photostability and charge separation of COFs are highly important to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic transformation. In this work, a fully conjugated donor-acceptor COF is constructed with a benzothiadiazole unit, which exhibits high stability and enhanced charge separation. The prepared COF can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anions under air and visible light, which mediate the photocatalytic oxidative amine coupling and cyclization of thioamide to 1,2,4-thiadiazole in moderate to high yield and high recyclability (18 examples).

As an important aspect of shape-selective catalysis, the significance of diffusion in conversion, deactivation, and product selectivity over molecular sieve catalysts has been recognized but still has not been interpreted quantitatively and explicitly. In the present work, direct tracking molecular diffusion in the SAPO-34 catalyst during the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction is successfully realized by combining the MTO reaction with the diffusivity evaluation by a pseudo-gas chromatography method which was operated in one catalyst bed under the real reaction condition. Diffusion behavior over the working catalyst can be measured along with the reaction to reflect the evolution in shape-selectivity catalysis in real time. For the first time, the accessibility of the catalyst microporous surface for the reactant was quantified during the reaction, which provided a rational understanding of the reaction and deactivation of MTO over the catalyst with continuous coke deposition. The evaluation of configurational diffusion hindrance in SAPO-34, because of the accumulation of organic species retained in the catalyst, corresponds well to the evolution of methanol conversion and product distribution and provides the scientific basis for manipulating the MTO reaction from the point of shape-selective catalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000064

This catalytic dehydrosilylation is one of the few examples of thermal catalytic functionalizations of unactivated alkylsilanes. The reaction involves transmetalation of an alkylsilane, beta-hydride elimination, release of the terminal olefin, and reoxidation of the palladium catalyst. A variety of linear internal olefins underwent the overall isomerization to terminal olefins in good yields and in good regioselectivities. Particularly noteworthy, isomerizations occurring over seven carbon units proceeded in yields that are comparable to those of isomerizations occurring over one carbon unit.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000065

Herein, an amorphous TiOx layer is introduced on the surface of crystalline TiO2 catalyst to form the core-shell structure (am@TiO2) via an oxidation corrosion method. Owing to the surface disordered TiO layer, the obtained ampTiO(2) exposes abundant -OH groups for the homogeneous loading of nanosized IrOx, while the charge carrier interfacial migration is substantially enhanced. The as-prepared IrOx-am@TiO2 exhibits photocatalytic water oxidation performance with an O-2 evolution rate of 143.6 mu mol/g.h, which is approximately 14 times higher than that of the bare ampTiO(2). Moreover, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.99% is obtained under LED-405 illumination. This work provides a direction for improving the photocatalytic performance and helps to gain a fundamental understanding of the water oxidation steps.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000066

The main drawback hindering its commercialization is the low selectivity to C-2-hydrocarbons due to their further oxidation to carbon oxides. In this respect, we focused on elucidating fundamentals of the previously reported positive effect of water on the activity and selectivity in the OCM reaction over MnOx-Na2WO4/SiO2 by means of steady-state kinetic and mechanistic tests at ambient pressure as well as temporal analysis of products with sub-millisecond resolution and isotopic tracers in vacuum. The obtained results cannot be rationalized by the earlier developed concepts explaining the role of water in the OCM reaction over this catalyst system. In addition, the selectivity-enhancing water effect was determined for MnOx/SiO2, MnOx/Al2O3, Na2WO4/SiO2, and Na2WO4/Al2O3, as well as SiO2-based materials with supported PbOx, ZrO2, or La2O3. No rate-improving effect was established for MnOx/Al2O3 and ZrO2/SiO2, while positive or negative effects were determined for PbOx/SiO2, MnOx/SiO2, and Na2WO4/SiO2 or La2O3/SiO2 and Na2WO4/Al2O3, respectively. Thus, testing other catalysts in the water presence seems to be promising in view of improving the OCM performance to an industrially attractive level. Owing to the developed protocol for catalyst testing under alternating water-free and water-containing OCM feeds, both reversible and irreversible water effects on the selectivity to C-2-hydrocarbons over MnOx-Na2WO4/SiO2 were identified. The irreversible effect was related to water-induced redispersion of MnOx. Mechanistic insights into the reversible rate- and selectivity-improving effects were derived from kinetic analysis of the rates of methane conversion into individual reaction products at different water partial pressures and temperatures. Selectivity-conversion relationships enabled us to understand the specific reaction pathways in the course of the OCM reaction affected by water. Water was established to increase the rates of methane conversion into C-2-hydrocarbons, CO, and CO2 with the strongest effect being determined for CO formation. For all the rates, the strength of the positive water effect decreases with an increase in temperature from 750 to 825 degrees C. In addition to the acceleration of methane conversion, water also helps to transform nonselective molecular-adsorbed oxygen species responsible for the direct oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000067

The method can be performed in dimethyl carbonate under air at room temperature and features a broad functional group compatibility. Metrics indicate the green potential of the developed versus the state-of-the-art methodologies. Mechanistic studies revealed no single electron transfer but involvement of an energy transfer from the excited photo-organocatalyst to thiosulfonate reactant, subsequently providing a sulfenyl and a sulfonyl radical via homolytic cleavage.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000068

Several enantiocomplementary IREDs were identified for the synthesis of (R)- and (S)-5-chloro-2-(5-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)benzo[d]oxazole with high enan- tioselectivity. The catalytic efficiency of (R)-selective IRED from Leishmania major (IR1) and (S)-selective IRED from Micromonospora echinaurantiaca IR25) was 0.027 and 0.962 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively. To further improve the catalytic efficiency of IR1, its double mutant Y194F/D232H was identified by saturation mutagenesis and iterative combinatorial mutagenesis, which exhibited 61-fold in the catalytic efficiency relative to that of wild-type enzyme. The density functional calculations and molecular dynamics simulations provided some insights into the molecular basis for the improved activity of mutant Y194F/D232H. Furthermore, Y194F/D232H and IR25 were applied to access a range of different substituted 1,4-diazepanes with high enantiomeric excess (from 93 to >99%). This study offers an effective method for construction of chiral 1,4-diazepanes of pharmaceutical importance via imine reductase-catalyzed intramolecular reductive amination of the corresponding aminoketones.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000069

Catalytic conversion of biomass usually involves tandem activation and cleavage of C-C and C-O bonds. Some steps occur in the aqueous phase and demand catalysts of high water resistance. Water-resistant ceria with redox and acid-base synergistic catalytic sites has attracted great interests particularly for biomass upgradation. The reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pairs and the existence of oxygen vacancies improve its redox ability and thus catalytic activity. Besides, the acid-base properties enable its use in acid-base catalytic reactions. The strength or concentration of acid-base sites is tailorable. The water-tolerance character is unique and thus can be employed in the conversion of dilute aqueous biomass solutions. In this Perspective, we summarize the latest research progress in the high-value utilization of biomass feedstocks, including biomass raw materials, platform molecules originated from biomass as well as its derivatives and downstream chemicals over pure CeO2, doped CeO2, and CeO2-supported metal catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000070

Her; we develop a catalyst of Pt nanoparticles on Al2O3 that exhibits extremely high activity with 100% CO conversion at -20 degrees C and orders of magnitude higher specific rate than current commercial catalysts. Detailed catalyst characterizations reveal the presence of metallic Pt sites and positively charged ones associated with the OH species in Pt/Al2O3. Both experimental data and theoretical calculations suggest that CO adsorbed on Pt(OH) kink sites reacts with OH species covering Pt-0 terrace sites to release CO2. Afterward, O-2 is facilely activated on terrace sites to regenerate OH. The presence of OH species and the synergy between Pt kink and terrace sites on the Pt species lead to an ultralow reaction barrier for CO oxidation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000071

However, low surface areas and incomplete release of metal from the lattice have prevented the widespread application of these materials. Here, we describe the preparation of thin perovskite films on stable supports by atomic layer deposition (ALE)) as a means for avoiding the limitations associated with bulk perovskites. Examples will be given which demonstrate that many of the favorable properties of perovskite supports can be retained, while avoiding some of the shortcomings.

Zeolite-encapsulated nanoparticles have been shown to be an effective catalyst architecture to regulate the sequence in which reactants and intermediates are exposed to different types of active sites in tandem reactions. In this work, pore size engineering of the encapsulating zeolite matrix is demonstrated to be an effective strategy to exercise selectivity control in tandem reaction involving bulky intermediates and products. Pt nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in H-BEA zeolites (Pt@H-BEA) are able to catalyze a one-step conversion of biomass-derived cyclopentanone (CPO) to C-10 cyclic hydrocarbons (bicyclopentane and decalin) with a combined yield of 78%, which is the first report of accomplishing the conversion of CPO to biojet fuels in one step. In contrast, Pt NPs encapsulated in MFI zeolites with smaller micropores with similar metal and acid site densities lead to primarily cyclopentane (similar to 70%). Kinetic analysis shows that the difference in pore size between these two zeolite frameworks is the primary cause for the drastic change in selectivity, likely due to the higher energetic barriers of formation and diffusion of bulky active complex, intermediates, and products. Pt NPs supported on either H-BEA or H-ZSM-5 are unselective toward C-10 cyclic hydrocarbons in the CPO conversion, indicating the importance of the encapsulated catalyst architecture. Pt@H-BEA exhibits excellent recydability with no detectable deactivation after three regeneration cycles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000075

Herein we fabricate a nanoporous gold electrocatalyst by electrochemical dealloying of potential cycling, which enables reducing carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide with a Faradaic efficiency of up to 98% at an overpotential of 390 mV. Pb-upd measurements verify that the high activity stems from the high density of step/kink sites with geometrically needed high-index facets on the curved internal surface. Moreover, a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ stripping voltammograms reveals that catalysis decay during long-term stability test results from the reduction of surface step/kink sites and the deposition of metal impurities (Zn, Pb, and Cu). The catalytic performance of the deactivated electrode can be recovered by applying potential cycling, which can restore the fractions of step/kink sites and remove surface metal impurities simultaneously.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000076

Using density functional theory, the Zn-catalyzed copolymerization mechanism has been characterized with a particular focus on the effects of chiral beta-diiminate (BDI) ligands as they influence the reactivity and enantioselectivity in the epoxide ring-opening step, where the latter is required for isotacticity. Theory indicates that both mono- and binuclear forms of the catalyst are involved along the reaction path, with the turnover-limiting step being ring-opening of the epoxide mediated by a binuclear catalyst. Subsequent CO2 insertion is predicted to be kinetically facile and preferentially mediated by a mononuclear catalyst. The predicted preference for epoxide opening to give R,R-stereocenters in the copolymer when N-(4-(((1S,2S)-2-(benzyloxy)cyclohexyl)amino)-5,5,S-trifluor- opent-3-en-2-ylidene)-2,6-dimethylaniline is used as the BDI ligand agrees with the experiment and is attributed to differential ligand distortions associated with key non-bonded interactions in the competing transition-state structures. Further analysis predicts that 2,6-dichloro and dibromo substitutions of the BDI ligand N-aryl groups) should result in increased rates and enantioselectivities for copolymerization.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000077

Its robust nature has meant-in the past-that selective manipulation of this motif remained elusive. The reductive activation through hydrosilylation of tertiary amides-using Vaska's complex (IrCl(CO)-(PPh3)(2))-has emerged as a powerful strategy for the chemo-selective transformation of amides into reactive enamines and iminium ions. Furthermore, these synthetically valuable species can be accessed in the presence of traditionally more reactive functional groups. This approach to amide reductive activation via hydro- silylation has been exploited in a range of downstream C-C bond forming processes and has seen significant applications in total synthesis, enabling streamlined routes for the synthesis of complex natural product architectures. This perspective covers the development of this synthetic strategy, from initial hydrosilylation studies to its flourishing use in the reductive functionalization of amide-containing molecules, both simple and complex.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000078

Both methylations with methanol (MeOH) and dimethyl ether (DME) are investigated via both stepwise and concerted mechanisms. Calculations are carried out using periodic density functional theory corrected by high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations on cluster models. While we find little selectivity between the methylations of different aromatics, our calculations indicate that isomerization via methyl shifts between different isomers is a viable mechanism with barriers comparable to methylation. The generally observed trend is that MeOH methylation barriers are smaller than those using DME, with the difference between MeOH and DME increasing with the level of methylation of the aromatic molecule.									2	0	1	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000081

This work introduces ZnO-containing ZrO2- or MZrOx -supported (M = Ce, La, Ti or Y) catalysts. The most active materials outperformed the state-of-the-art catalysts with supported CrOx, GaOx, ZnOx, or VOx species as well as bulk ZrO2-based catalysts without ZnO. The space-time yield of propene of 1.25 kg(C3H6).kg(cat)(-1).h(-1) at a propane conversion of about 30% with a propene selectivity of 95% was obtained over Zn(4 wt %)/TiZrOx at 550 degrees C. For deriving key insights into the structure of active sites, reactivity, selectivity, and onstream stability, the catalysts were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, EDX mapping, XPS, X-ray absorption, CO-TPR, CO2-TPD, NH3-TPD, pyridine-FTIR, operando UV-vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, TPO, and temporal analysis of products. In contrast with previous reports that used bulk ZrO2-based catalysts without ZnO, coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations are not the main active sites in the ZnO-containing catalysts. Supported ZnO, species were concluded to participate in the PDH reaction. The current X-ray absorption analysis proved that their structure is affected by the type of metal oxide used as a dopant for ZrO2 and by the crystallinity of ZrO2. Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species were concluded to show high activity and on-stream stability. Their intrinsic activity is enhanced when TiO2 and ZrO2 coexist in the support or when ZrO2 is promoted by TiO2. This is probably due to accelerating hydrogen formation in the course of the PDH reaction as concluded from temporal analysis of products with sub-millisecond resolution. The results of temperature-programmed oxidation of spent catalysts as well as ex situ Raman and operando UV-vis studies enabled us to conclude that the high on-stream stability of isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species in the PDH reaction is related to their low ability to form coke. In general, the tendency for coke formation seems to increase with an increase in the degree of ZnOx agglomeration.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000083

Herein, Pd supported on mesoporous Fe2O3 with a high specific surface area was rationally designed and chosen to construct the Pd/iron oxide interface. As a versatile model, the physicochemical environments of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) could be precisely controlled by taming the reduction temperature. The experimental and density functional theory calculation results unveiled that the catalyst in the support-metal interface confinement (SMIC) state showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and sintering resistance for CO oxidation. The constructed Fe sites at the interfaces between FeOx overlayers and Pd NPs not only provided additional coordinative unsaturated ferrous sites for the adsorption and activation of O-2, thereby facilitating the activation efficiency of O-2, but also impressively changed the reaction pathway of CO oxidation. As a result, the catalyst followed the Pd/Fe dual-site mechanism instead of the classical Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. For the catalyst in the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) state, its catalytic activity was seriously suppressed because of the excessive encapsulation of the active Pd sites by FeOx overlayers. The present study therefore provides detailed insights into the SMIC and SMSI in ferric oxide-supported Pd catalysts, which could guide the preparation of highly efficient supported catalysts for practical applications.									31	1	0	0	4	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000084

A detailed mechanistic study provided insight into the species responsible for this induction period and guided efforts to remove them. High-resolution electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and density functional theory computations revealed that a mu-hydroxide and a bridged 1,2-hydroxypropanolate complex are present during the induction period. Kinetic studies and additional computation indicated that the mu-hydroxide complex is a short-lived catalyst arrest state, where hydroxide dissociation from one metal allows for epoxide enchainment to form the 1,2-hydroxypropanolate arrest state. While investigating anion dependence on the induction period, it became apparent that catalyst activation was the main contributor for dormancy. Using a 1,2-diol or water as chain transfer agents (CTAs) led to longer induction periods as a result of increased 1,2-hydroxyalkanolate complex formation. With a minor catalyst modification, rigorous drying conditions, and avoiding 1,2-diols as CTAs, the induction period was essentially removed.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000085	34367720

Unlike neutral boranes, which are the most prevalent LAs for FLP hydrogenations, the Lewis acidity of cations can be tuned through modulation of the counteranion; however, detailed studies on such anion effects are currently lacking in the literature. Herein, we present experimental and computational studies which probe the mechanism of H-2 activation using iPr(3)SnOTf (1-OTf) in conjunction with a coordinating (quinuclidine; qui) and non-coordinating (2,4,6-collidine; col) base and compare its reactivity with {iPr,Sn.base}{Al[OC(CF3)(3)](4)} (base = qui/col) systems which lack a coordinating anion to investigate the active species responsible for H-2 activation and hence resolve any mechanistic roles for OTf- in the iPr(3)SnOTf-mediated pathway.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800014	32905389

Traditional oxidative additions of aryl chlorides to Pd complexes are known to be orders of magnitude faster than with aryl fluorides, and many palladium catalysts do not activate aryl fluorides at all. The experimental and computational studies outlined herein, however, support the view that at elevated Grignard/ArX ratios (i.e., 2.5:1), a Pd-Mg heterobimetallic mechanism predominates, leading to a remarkable decrease in the energy required for Ar-F bond activation. The heterobimetallic transition state for the C-X bond cleavage is proposed to involve simultaneous Pd backbonding to the arene and Lewis acid activation of the halide by Mg to create a low-energy transition state for oxidative addition. The insights gained from this computational study led to the development of a phosphine ligand that was shown to be similarly competent for Ar-F bond activation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800046	34221636

Treatment of the Fe complex with 1 equiv of diphenylacetylene results in the formation of a bimetallic bridging alkyne complex, along with dissociation of IPr from Fe. At elevated temperatures, the bridging alkyne complex undergoes oxidative coupling to form a dimetallacyclopentadiene complex, formally by a one-electron oxidation at each metal center. Each complex catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of diphenylacetylene. Kinetic studies exhibit first-order dependence on the bimetallic complexes, providing further support for the presence of these species in the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations support the experimental mechanistic data and suggest that the catalytic cycle is completed by binding of an alkyne to the diene complex, followed by insertion to form a hexatriene species that then undergoes ring closure to form an inverse sandwich complex, [DIPP(Me3Si)N]Fe(eta(6)-arene)Fe[N(SiMe3)DIPP]. The arene product is then displaced by alkyne to close the catalytic cycle.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800031

Her; we show a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic, and in situ spectroscopy measurements to probe the rWGS and methanation of carbon dioxide on a CeO2-dispersed isolated Ru catalyst (Ru-SnOx/CeO2, structure confirmed by HAADF-STEM) derived from the [Ru@Sn-9](6-) Zintl cluster decoration. Kinetic measurements, in combination with isotopiclabeling reactions, prove that rWGS and methanation occur through the kinetically relevant C-O bond rupture of surface carboxyl (HOCO*) and surface formate (HCOO*) respectively. A site-selective reaction model has been established on the basis of the response of rWGS and methanation to water pressure. Probably, the rWGS was carried out at the interface between the transition-metal nanoparticles and the support and could be influenced greatly by water, while the methanation was carried out at a site far away from the interface and has a weak dependence on water. This system can be easily extended to some other hydrogenation reactions, thus attracting attention to building isolated structures with Zintl clusters.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800032

Because of its high cost, NADH has to be necessarily regenerated from cheap and affordable raw materials. Herein, we show that the combination of the [Cp*Ir(R-pysa)NO3] (pysa = kappa(2)-pyridine-2-sulfonamidate; R = H, 4-CF3, and 6-NH2) complexes and H-P(O)(OH)(2) as hydride source constitutes a top-performing system for the chemical regeneration of NADH. Particularly, the enhanced metal acidity induced by the electronwithdrawing -S(O)(2)- bridge, between the -NH amide functionality and the pyridine-ring, and the presence of the -NH2 substituent in proximity to the metal are the key factors for obtaining the highest activity ever reported for the chemical regeneration of NADH (TOF up to 3731 h(-1), T = 313 K, pH = 6.58 by 0.4 M phosphite buffer), approaching that of enzymes.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800047

To monitor electrostatic changes along important steps during catalysis, we used a nitrile probe (T46C-CN) inserted proximal to the reaction center of three dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) with different biophysical properties, Escherichia coli DHFR (EcDHFR), its conformationally impaired variant (EcDHFR-S148P), and Geo bacillus stearothermophilus DHFR (BsDHFR). Our combined experimental and computational approach revealed that the electric field projected by the substrate toward the probe negates those exerted by the cofactor when both are bound within the enzymes. This indicates that compared to previous models that focus exclusively on subdomain reorganization and protein-ligand contacts, ligand-ligand interactions are the key driving force to generate electrostatic environments conducive for catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800042	32905264

A two-electron electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (2e(-) ORR) is a clean and on-site method for H2O2 production. Here, we report metal-free catalysts (mesoporous carbon hollow spheres, MCHS) for high-efficiency H2O2 production in neutral electrolytes (0.1 M PBS). The selectivity of H2O2 on MCHS catalysts is higher than 90% at a wide range of potentials (0.35-0.62 V), and it can reach 99.9% at a potential of 0.57 V. These catalysts show some of the best performances for H2O2 production in neutral electrolytes. It is preferable to develop H2O2 catalysts in a neutral environment, as the pH of the stabilizers used for H2O2 is also close to neutral. The outstanding activity of our catalyst comes from a combination of factors such as suitable porosity, the content of oxygen functional groups, and the types of different species of oxygen functional groups. First-principles simulations show that a catalyst with suitable mixed oxygen and COOH functional groups plays an important role in the catalytic formation of H2O2. The reported metal-free catalysts are promising catalysts for high-efficiency production of H2O2 in the future.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800001

[Rh(DPEphos)H-2](2) can be generated in situ from Rh(DPEphos)(benzyl) and catalyzes polyaminoborane formation (H2BNMeH)(n) [M-n = 15 000 g mol(-1)]. Closely related Rh-(Xantphos)(benzyl) operates at 0.1 mol % to give a higher molecular weight polymer [M-n = 85 000 g mol(-1)] on the gram scale with low residual [Rh], 81 ppm.

P.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 552-563]. For the neutral [Co-III(TAML(sq))] complex, this leads to the doublet (S = 1/2) mono-nitrene radical species [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(Y)] (bearing an unidentified sixth ligand Y in at least the frozen state), while a triplet (S = 1) bis-nitrene radical species [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(2)](-) is generated from the anionic [Co-III(TAML(red))](-) complex. The one-electron-reduced Fischer-type nitrene radicals (N(center dot)Ns(-)) are formed through single (mono-nitrene) or double (bis-nitrene) ligand-to-substrate single-electron transfer (SET). In this work, we describe the reactivity and mechanisms of these nitrene radical complexes in catalytic aziridination. We report that [Co-III(TAML(sq))] and [Co-III(TAML(red))](-) are both effective catalysts for chemoselective (C=C versus C-H bonds) and diastereoselective aziridination of styrene derivatives, cyclohexane, and 1-hexene under mild and even aerobic (for [Co-III(TAML(red))](-)) conditions. Experimental (Hammett plots; [Co-III(TAML)]-nitrene radical formation and quantification under catalytic conditions; single-turnover experiments; and tests regarding catalyst decomposition, radical inhibition, and radical trapping) in combination with computational (density functional theory (DFT), N-electron valence state perturbation theory corrected complete active space self-consistent field (NEVPT2-CASSCF)) studies reveal that [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(Y)], [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(2)](-), and [Co-III(TAML(sq))(N(center dot)Ns)](-) are key electrophilic intermediates in aziridination reactions. Surprisingly, the electrophilic one-electron-reduced Fischer-type nitrene radicals do not react as would be expected for nitrene radicals (i.e., via radical addition and radical rebound). Instead, nitrene transfer proceeds through unusual electronically asynchronous transition states, in which the (partial) styrene substrate to TAML ligand (single-) electron transfer precedes C-N coupling. The actual C-N bond formation processes are best described as involving a nucleophilic attack of the nitrene (radical) lone pair at the thus (partially) formed styrene radical cation. These processes are coupled to TAML-to-cobalt and cobalt-to-nitrene single-electron transfer, effectively leading to the formation of an amido-gamma-benzyl radical (NsN-CH2-(CH)-C-center dot-Ph) bound to an intermediate spin (S = 1) cobalt(III) center. Hence, the TAML moiety can be regarded to act as a transient electron acceptor, the cobalt center behaves as a spin shuttle, and the nitrene radical acts as a nucleophile. Such a mechanism was hitherto unknown for cobalt-catalyzed hypovalent group transfer and the more general transition-metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer to alkenes but is now shown to complement the known concerted and stepwise mechanisms for N-group transfer.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800003

Here, we shed light on the atomic-scale structure of hybrid Pt/FeNC catalysts (1-2 wt % of Pt), revealing, via scanning tunnelling electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the presence of Pt@FeOx particles. The absence of exposed Pt on the surface is confirmed by the suppression of methanol oxidation reaction and CO stripping experiments. The promising application of such Pt/FeNC catalysts, comprising FeNx sites and Pt@FeOx particles, is demonstrated at the cathode of DMFC. To gain fundamental understanding on the stability in acid medium and on the intrinsic ORR activity of Pt@FeOx, we constructed model surfaces by depositing FeOx films with controlled thickness (from 1.0 nm to 6.4 nm), fully covering the Pt(111) surface, which resulted stable in acid medium in the potential range of 0.45-1.05 V vs RHE. The specific ORR activity of Fe2O3/Pt(111) increases exponentially with decreasing overlayer thickness, which is explained by the tunneling of Pt electrons through Fe2O3. This special phenomenon sheds light onto recently reported excellent durability of Pt/FeNC composites in PEMFC and identify a promising core@shell strategy leading to stable PGM-free surfaces in acid medium, and tolerant to methanol.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800005

Formate is an ideal electron donor for cofactor regeneration due to its general availability, low reduction potential, and benign byproduct (CO2). However, formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) are usually specific to NAD(3), such that NADPH regeneration with formate is challenging. Previous studies reported naturally occurring FDHs or engineered FDHs that accept NADP(+), but these enzymes show low kinetic efficiencies and specificities. Here, we harness the power of natural selection to engineer FDH variants to simultaneously optimize three properties: kinetic efficiency with NADP(+), specificity toward NADP(+), and affinity toward formate. By simultaneously mutating multiple residues of FDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101, which exhibits practically no activity toward NADP(+), we generate a library of >10(6) variants. We introduce this library into an E. coli strain that cannot produce NADPH. By selecting for growth with formate as the sole NADPH source, we isolate several enzyme variants that support efficient NADPH regeneration. We find that the kinetically superior enzyme variant, harboring five mutations, has 5-fold higher efficiency and 14-fold higher specificity in comparison to the best enzyme previously engineered, while retaining high affinity toward formate. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the contribution of each mutation to the superior kinetics of this variant. We further determine how nonadditive epistatic effects improve multiple parameters simultaneously. Our work demonstrates the capacity of in vivo selection to identify highly proficient enzyme variants carrying multiple mutations which would be almost impossible to find using conventional screening methods.									7	1	0	0	4	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800008	32733773

In this paper, strong-base-modified covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were reported to be effective in the cleavage of the beta-O-4 linkage. With the modification, the cleavage rate of the beta-O-4 linkage was enhanced remarkably. Insight into the catalytic mechanism illustrated that the strong basic sites assisted the activation of C-beta-H bonds, which accounted for the promotion effect. The catalyst was further applied to the depolymerization of organosolv lignin, which showed 87% conversion of the beta-O-4 linkage. This strategy should be useful in the catalyst design for lignin depolymerization.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800009

The intensified mass and heat transport rates of the utilized membrane-based flow reactor enable access to safe and desirable reaction conditions (i.e., 50 psig syngas pressure) while providing high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the produced aldehydes. Additionally, by conducting hydrogen-deuterium scrambling experiments, we propose a reaction mechanism for the highly efficient hydroformylation reaction in flow.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800010

Tetrabutylammonium decatungstate and anthraquinone were found to act as synergistic HAT photocatalysts. Density PC isolated yield functional theory calculations suggested a Pd-0-Pd-II-Pd-III-Pd-I-Pd-0 pathway and revealed that regeneration of the Pd-0 catalyst and the photocatalyst occurs simultaneously in the presence of KHCO3. This regeneration features a low energy barrier, promoting efficient coupling of the palladium catalytic cycle with the photocatalytic cycle. The work reported herein suggests great promise for further applications of HAT photocatalysis in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling and C-H functionalization reactions to be successful.									17	1	0	0	5	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800011

We rationally designed several variants with up to 30-fold increased acyl transfer to hydrolysis ratios while mostly retaining initial activity. Variants exhibiting broader acyl-donor substrate scope and higher or inverted enantioselectivity were also designed. Alterations of the catalytic His-Asp pair decreased the activation of hydrolytic water, thereby increasing acyl transfer to hydrolysis ratios. This study demonstrates that targeting the disruption of water networks and manipulating the activation of nucleophiles are promising strategies for engineering promiscuous acyltransferase activities.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800012

This transformation is accomplished through the reaction of alkyl aldehydes with alkynes in the presence of dipropylamine and Hantzsch ester catalyzed by a P/N heteroleptic Cu(I)-based photosensitizer under photoredox catalysis conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that this aldehyde-alkyne coupling process comprises a regioselective radical addition of in situ-generated alkyl-substituted alpha-amino radicals to alkynes with subsequent 1,5-proton transfer, C-N bond cleavage, and concomitant isomerization of the resulting allyl radical species. Thus, in net result, dipropylamine serves as a traceless linker agent for the deoxygenative radical cross-coupling of alkyl aldehydes with alkynes under photoredox catalysis reaction conditions.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800013

As the single metal atoms are stabilized by coordination bonds with the substrate, the strong metal-support interactions can be exploited for ready manipulation of the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward target reactions. However, most single-atom catalysts (SACs) are prepared by pyrolysis and contain a wide range of coordination structures. Resolving the atomic configurations of the metal coordination moieties represents a critical first step in the establishment of an unambiguous correlation between the SAC structure and activity. In this Review, we summarize recent progress in the studies of single-atom electrocatalysts, with a focus on the impacts of the coordination structure of the single-atom sites on the electrocatalytic activities toward a series of reactions that are important for various electrochemical energy technologies, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and so on. The survey entails a wide range of SACs, from noble metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ru, Ir, Au, etc.) to non-noble metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.), supported on a variety of substrate materials (e.g., pristine and doped carbon, metal, metal oxide, metal sulfide, etc.). Finally, the Review concludes with a perspective highlighting the promises and challenges in the further development of SACs within the context of coordination chemistry.									63	0	0	0	3	0	63			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800015

However, the sole production of alkenes from the ODH process is significantly important but remains a great challenge due to the uncontrollable oxygen species for overoxidized products. Here, we report a sulfate-modified NiAl mixed oxide derived from layered double hydroxide that exhibits similar to 100% ethylene selectivity at 10% ethane conversion using N2O as a representative soft oxidant, which surpasses the previously reported catalysts. Extensive characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the sulfate modifier favors the formation of more species Ni3+ and promotes the isolation of electrophilic oxygen (O-) species through electronic and steric effects. Different from the conventional cognition of electrophilic oxygen species leading to overoxidation, we identify that the increase of the proportion of isolated electrophilic oxygen species determines the higher selectivity of ethylene. The isolated oxygen species are favorable for the effective breakage of C-H bonds of ethane to selectively produce ethylene with facile desorption, while the adjacent ones strongly bind ethylene and excessively break the C-H bonds to overoxidation. More importantly, the sulfate-modification strategy for increasing ethylene selectivity can be extendable to not only the CO2-assisted ODH reaction but also to other catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800016

Recently, the coating of catalysts to control their deactivation has generated much research traction. This Review is aimed at studying different encapsulation techniques employed for controlling catalyst deactivation. Focus is given to the prevention of irreversible modes of deactivation, such as sintering and leaching. In this Review, we elaborate on different entrapment methods used to protect catalysts from deactivation in both liquid and gas reaction media. Relevant probe reactions are discussed with emphasis on the catalyst activity and stability. Challenges associated with those processes are also described with emphasis on the mass transfer limitations as a result of the coverage of the active sites. Finally, some future perspectives and areas for possible improvement are highlighted.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800017

The validity of those predictions depends on the applied simulation protocol and its capability to account for all relevant aspects of the catalytic system. Commonly used approaches often only include an approximative treatment of solute-solvent interactions and neglect dynamic effects occurring at ambient temperature. In order to go beyond those limitations, we rely on a density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulation protocol, which shows that the inclusion of those effects is essential in order to understand the O-O bond formation process in various facets. In this work, we focus on the effects of a modification to the Py5 ligand framework of a Ru-based WOC. Previously, it was suggested that increasing the basicity of the pyridyl subunit results in a lower activation barrier for the O-O bond formation [Dalton Trans. 2018, 47, 10780-10490]. We take advantage of the metadynamics method to efficiently explore the O-O bond formation event using DFT-MD. This allows us not only to investigate in detail the beneficial effect an increased basicity has on the O-O bond formation but also to rationalize its origin and complexity that is in part found in the structure of the first solvation shell of the catalyst.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800018

In addition, because the cyano group can undergo various diversifying reactions, they are very versatile chiral building blocks for the synthesis of optically active aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carboxamides, amines, and N-heterocycles such as tetrazolium. Accordingly, the catalytic enantioselective cyanation reaction, as one of the most important C-C bond forming reactions, has been intensely studied in the past three decades. While traditional efforts mainly focus on the addition of the cyanide to highly polarized electrophiles as well as alkene hydrocyanation, intriguing directions in enantioselective cyanations have been opened, including the development of enantioselective alkene cyanofunctionalization, cyanation via C-H bond functionalization, and C-C bond cleavage, as well as the invention of bifunctional cyanating agents to design asymmetric tandem synthesis and to exploit enantioselective cyanide-free cyanation reactions. Additionally, significant advances have also been made in developing unprecedented chiral catalysts to address a long-term challenge, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse C-alpha-tetrasubstituted or quaternary alpha-chiral nitrites. This perspective aims to highlight these impressive advances, illustrates their key advantages and future applications, and provides some inspiration for related research.									17	1	0	0	5	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800019

While necessary, their presence adversely impacts the performance of the catalyst. PEMFC catalyst performance losses associated with Nafion ionomers are due to physical barriers to reactant gas transport and loss of active sites through specific adsorption of polymer-bound sulfonate groups on the catalyst surface. These impacts are particularly damaging for PEMFC high current density (HCD) performance. Here, we show that ionic liquids (IL) present at the catalyst interface can act to prevent the specific adsorption of sulfonate groups of Nafion on Pt surfaces, negating the detrimental impact of the ionomer on reaction rates, specifically for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This result holds promise for further Pt loading reductions in PEMFCs.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800020

In this work, we report Pd/C and Sn-Pd/C nanocatalysts for the base-free aerobic oxidation of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin, a challenging reaction not only in the fundamental research of selective oxidation of alcohols but also for the practical transformation of bio-based alcohols to value-added chemicals. We effectively tuned the mean size of Pd nanoparticles from 1.8 to 6.7 nm by varying the temperature used for catalyst preparation and further modified the electron density of the Pd/C catalyst by adding a SnO2 promoter with different loadings. TEM, HAADF-STEM, XPS, CO chemisorption, and in situ DRIFT-IR of CO adsorption characterizations allowed us to get insight into the unique catalytic properties of Pd nanocatalysts. It was conjectured that the base-free aerobic oxidation of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin over the Pd/C catalyst can be a structure-sensitive reaction and the Pd particle size was decisive for the dispersion of Pd, the proportion of catalytically active Pd-0 sites, and the intrinsic turnover frequency (iTOF). The 1 wt % Pd/C (1.8 nm) catalyst showed an iTOF value of 268 h(-1) and 100% yield to vanillin at 120 degrees C, 5 bar of O-2 , and 20 mg of the catalyst within 9 h. We further demonstrated that Sn4+ ions in SnO2 as an electronic promoter can promote Pd/C activity by the formation of highly active, electron-sufficient Pd-0 sites which significantly lowered the apparent activation energy of reaction. The 0.1Sn-Pd/C catalyst showed a higher iTOF value of 458 h(-1) and a yield of 100% to vanillin at 120 degrees C, 3 bar of O-2 and 15 mg of the catalyst within 6 h. Moreover, we verified a satisfying reusability and an adequate substrate scope over the 0.1Sn-Pd/C catalyst.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800021

Thus, the design and development of efficient and selective asymmetric catalysts are undoubtedly required. To solve this demanding situation, the discovery of innovative catalyst motifs, including unreported structural backbones or activation modes, that are able to overcome the actual limitations is essential. This Review discloses the mechanically interlocked molecules as emerging and powerful chiral catalysts, including their use as both organocatalysts and ligands in metal-mediated reactions. The structural and conformational properties of these entwined scaffolds, including their finely controllable responsiveness, make them privileged, although still underexplored, players in asymmetric catalysis.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800023

To this end, we have investigated structure-activity relationships in Pb2Ru2O7-x having pyrochlore structure by tuning the structural oxygen vacancy (O-vac) and metal oxidation states. Increase in O-vac with temperature boosts the ORR. activity by facilitating molecular oxygen dissociation via decrease in work function. O-vac formation is accompanied by lowering of the Ru(V)/Ru(IV) ratio due to charge-compensation which leads to decreased OER activity. Air-annealing of Pb2Ru2O7-x accelerates the formation of O-vac in comparison to Ar-annealing since atmospheric oxygen facilitates the reduction and phase-segregation of Ru from Pb2Ru2O7-x as RuO2. A maximum bifunctionality index and specific bifunctionality index of 0.69 V and 274.0 mu A/cm(BET)(2), respectively, are observed for pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x However, the activity is skewed toward OER for pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x creating an asymmetric bifunctional property which is not desirable for practical applications. To reduce the asymmetric behavior, pristine and air-annealed Pb2Ru2O7-x samples at 700 degrees C are physically mixed which yields a higher symmetric OER/ORR activity (vertical bar Delta i(OER(eta = 0.2.5 V)-ORR(eta = -0.45) (specific)(V))vertical bar: pristine = 0.25 mA/cm(BET)(2) , Air-700 degrees C = 0.20 mA/cm(BET)(2), physical mixture = 0.037 mA/cm(BET)(2)). The inverse OER/ORR relationship in Pb2Ru2O7-x is attributed to the presence of an optimal ratio of 0.75 for Ru(V)/Ru(IV) and O-vac/O-lattice which provides symmetric bifunctional activity essential in electrochemical devices. An increase in Ru(V)/Ru(IV) ratio in pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x with no detectable Ru dissolution in the electrolyte observed subsequent to a 5-h OER hold-test, confirming high stability.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800024

One important but open question is the origin of poisoning during the photoreaction of primary alcohols on a bare, reduced rutile TiO2(110) crystal under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. By comparing the photocatalytic properties of methanol and 2-methyl-2-pentanol, it is demonstrated that the fading activity in methanol photoreforming does not originate from the often-assigned increase of trap states for photon-generated charge carriers. Instead, we attribute the apparent catalyst poisoning to an increased rate of thermal back reactions, particularly to that of the photochemical oxidation step. While overall back reactions are generally considered in photocatalysis, back reactions of individual steps are largely neglected so far. Our work shows that their inclusion in the reaction scheme is inevitable for the comprehensive modeling of photocatalytic processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800025

Herein, bimetallic nanoparticles in a metal-organic framework (MOF), i.e., CuPd@ZIF-8 composite, featuring a cubic CuPd core and a porous ZIF-8 shell, have been rationally fabricated for this end. Given the unique physicochemical properties, the Cu nanocubes can not only convert solar energy into heat to accelerate the reaction but also serve as the seed for in situ formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on their external surface to regulate the chemoselectivity of Pd active sites. The additional growth of the MOF shell is helpful to stabilize the CuPd core and offer regioselectivity via the steric hindrance effect. Ammonia borane provides active hydrogen species to significantly boost the hydrogenation and ensure the high selectivity. As a result, the CuPd@MOF exhibits high efficiency, featuring a turnover frequency (TOF, 6799 min(-1)) of 5-10(5) times higher than that in previous reports, and high chemo- and regioselectivity toward the semihydrogenation of alkynes, in the presence of NH3BH3 as a hydrogen source, under visible-light irradiation at ambient temperature.									16	0	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800026

Herein, we employed naturally occurring phytic acid as a renewable precursor to fabricate titanium phosphate (TiP)-supported Ru nanocatalysts with different reduction degrees of RuO2 (Ru/TiP-x, x represents the reduction temperature) by combining ball milling and moltensalt processes. Very interestingly, the obtained Ru/TiP-100 had good catalytic performance for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds at ambient temperature, resulting from the synergistic cooperation of the support (TiP) and the Ru/RuO2 with a suitable proportion of Ru-0 (52%). Various carbonyl compounds could be efficiently converted into the corresponding primary amines with high yields. More importantly, the conversion of other substrates with reducible groups could also be achieved at ambient temperature. Detailed investigations indicated that the partially reduced Ru and the support (TiP) were indispensable. The high activity and selectivity of Ru/TiP-100 catalyst originates from the relatively high acidity and the suitable electron density of metallic Ru-0.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800027

These come as charged or neutral complex species, frequently as Mg-based complex ions, and Lewis-base anions. The electroactive species are usually comprised also of solvent molecules and chlorides as ligands. Numerous studies had shown the critical role of Cl-based species on the electrochemical reaction kinetics, deposition and dissolution overpotentials, electrocrystallization morphology, and many other imperative aspects of the electrochemical responses. Only very few, quite exotic and not fully studied, Cl-free electrolyte solutions have been reported to maintain reversible Mg deposition. Over the years, several compelling theories have been proposed to explain the decisive role of the Cl-containing species on the electrochemical reaction mechanisms during magnesium deposition and dissolution. The role of chlorine-based species in intercalation processes of Mg ions into crystalline hosts was seldom pursued, though. Interestingly, it appears that the Chevrel phase (CP) MgxMo6S8, the main benchmarking Mg intercalation compound, does not intercalate Mg in Cl-free solutions at room temperature (RT). This was established over and again during past decades and recently had been corroborated over a large set of experiments in our lab. Herein, we reveal, via experimental work, that Cl-based species also have a critical role in the electrochemical processes of intercalation. In this work, we studied the function of these during the course of the intercalation process of Mg ions into CP electrodes. We demonstrate that the intercalation process is extremely sluggish, to the point of nonexistent, from Cl-free electrolyte solutions. Quite remarkably, the addition of chlorine-comprising species opens the door to facile magnesium intercalation. On the basis of the numerous experimental results, we suggest a detailed Mg intercalation mechanism into CP. The proposed mechanism emphasizes the importance of the Cl-based species on the charge transfer process across the solid/solution interface. We propose that surface absorbed Cl-containing complexes reduce the activation energy for the interfacial charge transfer stage involving the transport of Mg ions from the solution to the crystalline phase and vice versa. We also propose a relatively simple manner to alleviate the intercalation impediment of Cl-free electrolyte solutions by the cathode's chemical or electrochemical pretreatment. This project has both scientific and applicative significance and may open a hatch for the future development of practical rechargeable Mg batteries (RMBs).									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800028

The activities for D/H exchange Ae(NR2)(2) (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba) were found to be highly active catalysts for between C6D6 and H-2 strongly increase with metal size (Ca < Sr < Ba) and with amide bulk: N(SiMe3)(2) < N(DIPP)(SiiPr(3))< N(SiiPr(3))(2), DIPP = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl. At 120 degrees C and pressures of 10-50 bar, no hydrogenation side-products are produced, and TONs of 205 and TOFs of 268, competitive with those for precious metal catalysts, have been achieved. The reverse H/D exchange between C6H6 and D-2 is even faster by a factor 1.5-2. Substrates also include a range of substituted arenes. Alkyl-substituted aromatic rings are preferably deuterated in acidic benzylic positions, and this tendency increases with the number of alkyl-substituents. Although unactivated (sp(3))C-H units could not be deuterated, the (sp(3))Si-H function in primary, secondary, and tertiary alkylsilanes could be converted. Two different pathways for C6H6/D-2 isotope exchange have been evaluated by DFT calculations: (A) a deprotonation/protonation mechanism and (B) direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Although the exact nature of the catalyst(s) is unclear, the first step is the conversion of Ae(NR2)(2) with D-2 into R(2)NAeD which can aggregate to larger clusters. Energy profiles with model catalysts (iPr(3)Si)(2)NAeD and [(Me3Si)(2)NAeD](2) (Ae = Ca or Ba) show that the direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution is the most likely mechanism for deuteration of arenes. The key to this unusual reaction is the initial formation of a pi-arene center dot center dot center dot Ae complex which is followed by the generation of an intermediate with a Meisenheimer anion. Heavier Ae metal amide complexes are, despite the lack of partially filled d-orbitals for substrate activation, potent catalysts for HIE.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800030

However, standard theoretical approaches based on density functional theory (DFT) suggest complete poisoning of the active sites and are unable to rationalize the experimentally observed dramatic pH dependence and Tafel slopes, which have a critical impact on the electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we overcome these challenges through a rigorous theoretical investigation of FeNC single-atom catalysts using a combination of several state-of-the-art methods: hybrid functionals, continuum solvation, and potential-dependent electrochemical reaction energetics. Our model shows dipole-field interactions in CO2 adsorption to determine the overall activity, which resolves the contentious origin of experimentally observed pH dependence and rationalizes differences in activity and Tafel slopes among different samples in experimental work. A critical conclusion of our study is that single-atom catalysts can be tuned for electrocatalytic activity not only through the traditionally considered binding energies but also through the corresponding surface dipole moment of rate-determining surface intermediates. Our presented methodology paves the way for accurate mechanistic studies as well as the computational catalyst design of general single-atom catalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800034

A critical step for enzymatic and whole-cell production of FDCA from 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) is the transformation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furoic acid (HMFA) into 5-formylfuroic acid (FFA). Here, we establish periplasmic pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) as biocatalytic tools for the oxidation of HMFA, HMF, and 5-formylfurfural (FFF). Further, we identify several amino acid residues including the "lid loop" of the substrate channel as promising targets for future engineering steps toward a fully periplasmic oxidation pathway to FDCA.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800035

Individual decorated fd phages are visualized and simultaneously functionally interrogated by Mt/AFM-SECM microscopy, an in situ local probe correlative imaging technique, combining atomic force (AFM) and electrochemical (SECM) microscopy in a mediator tethered (Mt) configuration. The statistical distribution of catalytic activity across the fd population is resolved, and the correlation between the functional properties of the phages and their actual dimensions is assessed. Moreover, achievement of subparticle resolution allows the enzymatic activity of individual viruses to be spatially mapped, revealing a highly active region located in the middle of the filamentous fd-scaffold. Quantitative modeling shows that this "catalytic hot-spot" arises from the interplay between charge transport by electron hopping between ferrocene moieties along the viral particles and enzymatic catalysis. The developed model also enables complete analysis of GDH kinetics at the single bioscaffold scale, revealing differences in the functional behavior of the biocatalytic viral particles when addressed at the ensemble or at the single-particle scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800036

Using a series of in situ characterizations (XPS, HS-LEIS, DRIFTS, and EXAFS), H-2-TPR, and transient kinetic analysis, two reactive surface oxygen species with different reduction characteristics are identified for catalysts during the reaction. The more abundant and more active surface oxygen species are closely related to the surface hydroxyls located at the Cu-Fe3O4 interfacial regions. A direct correlation of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction rate with both the number and reduction kinetics of the more active surface oxygen intermediates is established.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800037

Inspired by the natural MoFe protein-based enzyme, the nitrogenase, we exploited this electrochemical process with a unique two-dimensional catalyst, namely, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C). The catalyst is synthesized through a chemical vapor deposition method, with a highly orientated (200) facet of the alpha-Mo2C phase. A remarkable Faradaic efficiency as high as 40.2% has been achieved on the (200) faceted alpha-Mo2C during the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Density functional theory calculations confirm that rate-determining steps *NNH2 -> NNH3 and *NH -> *NH2 experience a low energy barrier on the (200) surface following the proton-electron coupled, distal associated mechanism. To protect Mo from leaching during the NRR process, we also grew layers of graphene on top of Mo2C, forming a chemically enduring two-dimensional heterostructured electrode.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800038

In this context, the use of artificial enzymes that are capable of substitute traditional industrial processes by environmental friendly routes is a challenge. Unfortunately, the complete understanding of the catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes remains elusive, thus hampering creation and development of enzymatic proteins. In this paper, the molecular mechanism of the non-natural multistep retro-aldolase reaction catalyzed by a de novo biocatalyst, the RA95.5-5, has been investigated by means of multiscale QM/MM methods. The design of a retro-aldolase presents the difficulty to create an enzyme being able to stabilize several transition states, maintaining low-energy barriers along the overall reaction. The obtained QM/MM free-energy landscape has allowed defining the rate-determining step corresponding to the carbon-carbon bond scission of the substrate, which is in accordance with the experimental data. A deep analysis of the electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the different amino acid residues of the protein, as well as the estimation of the electrostatic potential generated on key atoms of the substrate, has been carried out for the key steps of the reaction. The results, compared with previous computational studies on the most efficient de novo retro-aldolase, the RA95.5-8F, explains the different activities achieved during the directed evolution process and provides insights for future developments of more efficient enzymes.									6	1	0	0	3	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800039

To this end, N-doped carbon composites (NC) are prepared with different N-doping contents and used as supports for Fe particles. We find N-doped carbonaceous materials enable an effective control of the Fe oxidation state via an electronic interaction between Fe and N. This interaction leads to a decrease in the Fe particle size when the N-doping content is increased, as shown by structural characterization of transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction, and to a weakened oxygen affinity of the Fe particles in the presence of N-doped sites, as unveiled by H-2-temperature-programmed reduction measurements with separate N2O and water vapor pretreatments. The weaker oxygen affinity correlates with the excellent long-term stability of Fe/NC catalysts during the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived m-cresol to form valuable aromatic products, whereas obvious oxidative deactivation is observed for Fe/C. An investigation of the surface nitrogen composition of all N-doped samples shows that their deactivation rate constants are closely related to the nitrogen content anchoring Fe into the carbon architecture, which indicates unambiguously that embedding nitrogen into the carbon skeleton (mainly including pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen functional groups) plays a critical role in stabilizing Fe, while amino-N is inclined to suffering from wastage during the hydrodeoxygenation reaction. These results are further confirmed computationally through an electronic analysis of Fe-N complexes embedded into graphene, showing that skeletal nitrogen sites shield Fe from oxidation relative to bare carbon or aminic nitrogen.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800040

Details of the promotion mechanism established on atomic precise identification upon the active sites structure as well as the electronic status is seldomly reported yet. In the present work, we report the direct identification of valence status and coordination configuration of ZrO2 promoter additive over the cobalt-based FTS catalysts under a wide range of Zr/Co molar ratios from 0.12 to 1.5. Evidences from multiple technologies, including in situ/ex situ atomic resolution STEM imaging, EDS elemental mapping, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), as well as physicochemical analyses (in situ XRD, CO chemisorption, CO temperature-programmed surface reaction, etc.) disclose that the ZrO2 promoter presents as single-site dispersion on the surface of Co nanopartides (NPs) and the SiC support at low content, plays as the real active site to promote CO dissociation at the CoZrO2 interface. While at high ZrO2 content (Zr/Co molar ratio of 1.0), Zr species on the SiC support turns to nucleate to form an amorphous coating, whereas those on the Co NPs surface maintain monodispersion. When further increasing the ZrO2 content (Zr/Co molar ratio up to 1.5), cobalt NPs start to be encapsulated by ZrO2 coating, leading to the decline of FTS activity. The in situ EELS analysis and density functional theory calculations disdose that the Zr atom tends to bind at the Co NPs surface rather than embed into the lattice meanwhile a charge transfer from Zr species to Co NPs occurs, which facilitates the stronger interaction between Zr and cobalt and thus enhances the adsorption with the H-2 molecule as well as the CO dissociation. It thus offers enhanced catalytic activity and long-chain hydrocarbon selectivity during the FTS reaction.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800041

A catalytic process that converts NO2- to less harmful products has been proven to be an effective strategy for NO2- removal.

Here, we report experimental and theoretical evidence that both Ir and CuxIr(100-x) nanoparticles possess near 100% NH3 selectivity for NO2- reduction compared to the <1% NH3 selectivity achieved by nano-Pd. These NH3-selective catalysts could be useful for both water purification and ammonia production.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800043

In this regard, irradiated TiO2, suspensions are simple and suitable systems to highlight some mechanisms of general validity in the aforementioned research fields. In this work the spin-trapping technique has allowed highlighting the concurrent action of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals toward bromide ions. In fact, hydroxyl radicals oxidize bromide ions to bromine atoms, which in turn can be reduced back to bromide ions by superoxide radicals. The results suggest that this relay mechanism, mainly based on secondary redox products (such as reactive oxygen species, ROS) rather than on direct interfacial electron transfer, is responsible for the generally observed constant concentration of bromide ions in irradiated TiO2 suspensions. The presence of nitrate ions in the system significantly alters this equilibrium. In fact, nitrate radicals generated by hole-induced oxidation of nitrate ions selectively oxidize bromide ions to elemental bromine even under anoxic conditions, but in the presence of bromate as an opportune electron scavenger. This result not only reveals the importance of nitrate radicals toward the photocatalytic production of elemental bromine but also confirms the active role of nitrate ions in irradiated photocatalytic suspensions.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800044

Biocatalytic synthesis of 2-ketoacids starting from L-amino acids would be highly desirable because the substrates are readily available from biomass feedstock. Here, we report bioinformatic exploration of a series of aminotransferases (ATs) to achieve the desired conversion. Thermodynamic control was achieved by coupling an L-glutamate oxidation reaction in the cascade for the recycling of the amine acceptor. These enzymes were able to convert a majority of proteinogenic amino acids into the corresponding 2-ketoacids with high conversion (up to 99%) extendable, and one-pot two-step processes were established for the synthesis of D-amino acids and N-methylated amino acids, achieving great overall conversion (up to 99%) and high ee values (>99%). These developed enzymatic methodologies offer convenient routes for utilizing amino acids as synthetic reagents.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800048

Application to an Oxygen Evolution Catalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	14			7958	7967		10.1021/acscatal.0c02532				JUL 17 2020	2020	Proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) catalysts are investigated in the framework of cyclic voltammetry (CV). We analyze heterogeneous catalysts and provide a detailed kinetic analysis of the various responses expected in the case of a PCET catalyst following either stepwise or concerted pathways. Both buffered solution and nonbuffered aqueous media are considered. In the first case, we show that, besides possible limitation by buffer diffusion, the PCET sequence may be rate-limiting. CV wave shape, position, and intensity are discussed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic penalties associated with each mechanism. When water is the proton acceptor in aqueous solution, diffusion of hydronium ions away from the electrode surface is a key parameter, and we show that, for stepwise processes, the equilibrated PCET is not the optimal catalytic response. Finally, we illustrate this formal analysis with an electrodeposited cobalt oxide behaving as a PCET catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in phosphate buffer. The PCET is at equilibrium, and the rate-determining step is a chemical step, presumably O-O bond formation, but the CV is controlled by buffer diffusion in the investigated conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800049

By the combination of Pd(PPh3)(4) and 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthalene (binap), a variety of functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkynes, aliphatic alkynes, propargylamines, and propargyl ethers, could be leveraged to provide a wide array of alpha-acrylic acids in high yields with high regioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies revealed that this reaction proceeded via the cyclopalladation process of alkynes and carbon dioxide in the presence of binap to generate a five-membered palladalactone intermediate and enabled the formation of Markovnikov adducts. Moreover, this strategy provided an effective method for the late-stage functionalization of alkyne-containing complicated molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800050

Both species present major environmental challenges; NO2- is also highly toxic to humans. Available technologies for the removal of NO3- and NO2- from potable water are hampered by a number of issues, which limit their widespread usage. Catalytic degradation of NO3- and NO2- is a potentially disruptive technology. However, the high cost of palladium metal required for this process is a significant economic barrier. Herein, we report the synthesis of scalable catalyst materials based on randomly alloyed palladium-silver nanoparticles. These catalysts significantly lower the overall catalyst cost and simultaneously achieve a 3.4-times increase in the catalytic activity for NO2- hydrogenative reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that alloying Pd with Ag creates more favorable surface binding sites, which is the origin of the increased catalytic activity. The catalysts are also highly selective toward the production of nitrogen gas over ammonia.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800051

We combine the electrochemical analysis with the quantitative analysis of cobalt content using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, transient behavior analysis using in operando XANES electrochemical analysis, and structural analysis using cryogenic X-ray absorption spectroscopy to show that three distinct behavioral regimes exist. Each behavioral regime suffers from a degree of corrosion, but both self-healing and self-repair mechanisms are capable of partially stabilizing the cobalt content within the catalyst film. However, even if the absolute cobalt content of the film is fully stabilized, the catalytic behavior of the film degrades over time. This behavior is attributed to observed structural evolution of the material, where mid- and long-range structural order increases during operation. The increased structural order appears independent of whether self-healing or self-repair mechanisms are activated and results in fundamental changes in the catalytic behavior, observable as decreased turnover frequency and increased Tafel slopes. These results reveal that the cobalt content or electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst films can be stabilized by controlling the applied voltage or solution composition, but simultaneous stabilization of both is not currently possible.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800052

Oxide-derived Cu catalysts exhibit a remarkable selectivity toward multicarbon products for the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR), but the exact role of the oxide remains elusive for explaining the performance enhancements. Here, we used operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with simultaneous measurements of the catalyst activity and selectivity by gas chromatography (GC) to study the relationship between oxidation states of Cu-based catalysts and the activity for ethylene (C2H4) production in a CO gas-fed cell. By utilizing a custom-built XAS cell, oxidation states of Cu catalysts can be probed in device-relevant settings and under high current densities (>80 mA cm(-2)) for the CORR. By employing an electrochemical oxidation process, we found that the Cu oxidation states and specific ion species do not correlate with C2H4 production. The difference in the CORR activity is also investigated in relation to electrochemical surface area (ECSA) changes. While the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is positively correlated to the ECSA changes, the increased C2H4 activity is not proportional to the ECSA. Ex situ characterization from microscopic techniques suggests that the changes in the C2H4 activity and selectivity may arise from a morphological transformation that evolves into a more active structure. These comprehensive results give rise to the development of a cell regeneration method that can restore the performance of the Cu catalyst without cell disassembly. Our study establishes a basis for the rational design of highly active electrocatalysts for broad-range reactions in a gas-fed device.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800053

This protocol set up a platform toward diverse alpha-arylated 1,6-dicarbonyl frameworks found in natural products and drugs, which are still highly challenging targets in traditional alpha-arylation protocols because of competitive selectivity of enolation. A removable directing group, gram-scale reaction, and modification of complex molecules have additionally demonstrated that the anti-Michael reductive Heck reaction is a powerful complementary strategy to the classical alpha-arylation approaches.

PatG and related dual-action proteases from cyanobactin biosynthesis are responsible for cleaving off the C-terminal recognition sequence and macrocyclizing the substrate to provide cyclic peptides. This reaction has found use in the enzymatic synthesis of diverse macrocycles. However, these enzymes function best on substrates that terminate with the nonproteinogenic thiazole/thiazoline residue, complicating synthetic strategies. Here, we biochemically characterize an additional class of PatG-like macrocyclases that natively use proline, obviating the necessity of additional chemical or biochemical steps. We experimentally define the biochemical steps involved in synthesizing the widespread prenylagaramide-like natural products, including macrocyclization and prenylation. Using saturation mutagenesis, we show that macrocyclase PagG and prenyltransferase PagF are highly promiscuous, producing a library of more than 100 cyclic peptides and their prenylated derivatives in vitro. By comparing our results to known cyanobactin macrocyclases, we catalog a series of enzymes from this family that should synthesize most small macrocycles. Collectively, these data reveal that, by selecting the right cyanobactin macrocyclase, a large array of enzymatically synthesized macrocycles are accessible.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800015	33457065

A vast broad spectrum of applications reflects their high biotechnological importance. The crystal structure of McoA from the hyperthermophilic bacteria Aquifex aeolicus has the most tightly compact and hydrophobic core among its prokaryotic counterparts. A 29-residue long loop enriched in glycines and methionines (Met-loop) close to the active T1 Cu center is not detected in the electron density maps. Accurate prediction of loop structures remains challenging, especially for long segments with sizable conformational space. Therefore, a combination of Rosetta and molecular dynamics simulations with ensemble-based small-angle X-ray scattering analysis was used to probe the conformational landscape of the Met-loop. The results indicate a highly flexible omega-loop, which is nevertheless not random but preferentially follows open-to-close transitions, exposing or occluding the T1 Cu site. Loop-truncated variants maintain wild-type stability and consistently lower and higher catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K-m) for organic and metal substrates, respectively. Our results suggest that the loop transient dynamic equilibrium can exert important switch-like regulatory function, defining a role for Met-rich motifs as dynamic gate-gappers. This work provides insights into the dynamics of Met-rich loops essential to understand the molecular determinants of substrate promiscuity and catalytic rates within multicopper oxidases. We anticipate that engineering the Met-loop structural dynamics will unleash important changes in enzyme function and specificity with impact on their applications.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800017

This rapid assay utilizes the colorimetric changes of a high contrast indicator dye, coumarin 6, to monitor the photo-induced electron transfer from a sacrificial amine donor to the metal complex excited state. The resulting [Ir(C boolean AND N)(2) (N boolean AND N)](0) can then reduce an aryl bromide to form the highly reactive aryl radical intermediate. The rate of this reaction is dictated by the molecular structure of both coordinating ligands. Relative reaction rate constants determined via this method correlated closely with F-19 NMR measurements obtained using a fluorinated substrate. A simple model that expresses the rate constant as a product of a single "strength" parameter assigned to each of the 72 ligands can well account for the 1152 measured rate constants. The best performing complexes exhibit much higher reactivity than the benchmark photocatalysts commonly used in photoredox transformations. The catalysts were also successfully tested for their chemoselectivity. The developed screening methodology can enable generation of the large data sets needed to use modern data science to extract structure-activity relationships.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800001

The intimate relation between the kinetics network of the reaction, catalyst deactivation kinetics, and residence time distribution is analyzed. The question is addressed why the deactivation of the alkylation reaction in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is slow compared to that in a tubular plug flow reactor (PFR). Conditions are derived where such differences will be minimum and maximum. In the reaction regime of high alkylate selectivity, linear and quadratic power law kinetics equations in propylene concentration can be deduced from microkinetics. They are used to derive analytical expressions of deactivation times for CSTR and PFR. The theoretical power law kinetics equations can be related to previously established empirical rate equations of catalyst deactivation. We show that, in the CSTR, the self-alkylation reaction path contributes substantially to the deactivation time. In the self-alkylation reaction, alkylate is formed by reaction of the isobutene reaction intermediate and isobutane. Catalysts of high proton strength can benefit catalyst deactivation times by suppressing the carbenium ion deprotonation reaction that produces alkenes as isobutene. In the PFR, selective alkylate formation occurs only when the reaction occurs in a reaction zone of the catalyst bed. Deactivation is faster than in CSTR because of the reactant profile in the reaction zone. This reaction zone has restricted mobility due to the fast deactivation of reactive protons located behind the reaction zone by alkenes formed by nonselective reactions in the reaction zone. In PFR, as long as the reaction is limited to an immobile reaction zone, deactivation time is independent of reaction site density and contact time. Contact time dependence arises when the reaction zone is mobile. Overall deactivation time then depends strongly on the degree of deactivation of the protons behind the reaction zone.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800002

Perovskites are known as typical total combustion catalysts in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The fundamental question that we investigate here is whether surface modifications of perovskites can lead to the formation of valuable reaction products in alkane oxidation. We studied the effect of segregated two-dimensional surface nanostructures on selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Manganese-based perovskites AMnO(3) (A = La, Sm) were prepared by combustion and hydrothermal synthesis. Bulk and surface structures were investigated by X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), multiwavelength Raman, and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) in combination with near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Surface oxygen species responsible for C-H activation were distinguished by AP-XPS on the basis of a rigorous in situ analysis of the O is spectra recorded under a broad range of reaction conditions. Signals at 529.2, 530.1, 530.9, 531.2, and 531.8 eV were attributed to lattice O, defect-affected O, surface O, oxygen in carbonates, and hydroxyl groups, respectively. Operando AP-XPS revealed critical surface features, which occur under catalyst operation. The catalyst performance depends on the synthesis technique and the reaction conditions. In presence of a two-dimensional MnOx surface phase, addition of steam to the feed resulted in an increase in selectivity to the partial oxidation product propene to practically relevant values. The selectivity increase is related to the presence of Mn in a low oxidation state (2+/3+), an increased concentration of hydroxyl groups, and a higher abundance of adsorbed activated oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The surface analysis of a working catalyst highlights the importance of the termination layer of polycrystalline perovskites as a genuine property implemented by catalyst preparation. Such a termination layer controls the chemical properties and reactivity of perovskites. The information provides input for the development of realistic models that can be used by theory to predict functional properties.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800003

Recently, applications of machine-learning (ML) algorithms involving catalysis have begun to appear with increasing frequency, as they constitute an attractive pathway both for discovering prospective species and identifying trends surrounding catalytic behavior, principally because the number of potential catalysts that can be examined greatly exceeds those found in more traditional experimental or theoretical approaches. Here, we harness a data-driven approach powered by ML in tandem with molecular volcano plots to estimate the activity of over 143,000 homogeneous nickel catalysts bearing phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene ligands for the reductive C(sp(2))-O cleavage reaction in aryl ether compounds, an important step in the degradation of biomass (lignin) into industrially useful feedstock chemicals. Our computational workflow reveals that a vast majority of Ni-phosphine and Ni-carbene catalysts are not ideally tuned to facilitate this reaction. An analysis of those species identified as being the most promising uncovers a clear catalytic design strategy that can be exploited in an experimental setting to enhance the rate of reductive C(sp(2))-O cleavage of aryl ether compounds.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800004

In a differential bubble column reactor, the apparent activation energy of the molten salt decreases from 301 kJ/mol for the eutectic NaCl-KCl to 171 kJ/mol for 3 wt % of iron-added as FeCl3. The solid carbon produced in the iron-containing salt mixture has a graphitic structure which is distinct from the more disordered carbon produced in the iron-free eutectic, suggesting a different solid carbon formation pathway. Results from H-D exchange investigations are consistent with a different reaction pathway for methane pyrolysis in the iron-containing NaCl-KCl melt than in the melt without Fe. The activity of the salt mixture was stable for over 50 h, producing molecular hydrogen and separable solid carbon. It is likely that the activity is due to the presence of Fe in molecular ions stabilized in the NaCl-KCl melt that facilitate the C-H bond activation in methane.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800005

This contribution addresses electrocatalytic properties of Ni-based catalysts in reactions of fuel oxidation in alkaline media. It first details the electrochemical behavior of Ni in alkaline media and approaches to determine the active surface area of Ni electrodes. Second, the electrocatalytic activities of Ni-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction are described (an endeavor for the development of anion exchange membrane fuel cells), along with a detailed analysis of the strategies put forward to improve them. It is notably shown that the state of Ni surface (oxidized or reduced) largely determines its electrocatalytic activity. This state of the surface also conveys a pivotal importance regarding the activity of Ni for the oxidation of complex fuels (borohydride, boranes, and hydrazine). Finally, emphasis is made on the durability of Ni-based catalysts in alkaline environments. It is shown that, in such media, the material durability of Ni-based electrodes can be high, but this does not necessarily warrant stable electrocatalytic activity, because of possible deactivation following surface oxide or bulk hydride formation in operation.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800006

Based on the composition of the active site cofactor, the monometallic [Fe]-hydrogenase is distinguished from the bimetallic [NiFe]- or [FeFe]-hydrogenase. The latter has been reported with particularly high turnover activities for both H-2 release and H-2 oxidation, notably at neutral pH, ambient temperatures, and negligible electric overpotential. Due to these properties, [FeFe]-hydrogenase represents the "gold standard" in enzymatic hydrogen turnover. Understanding hydrogenase chemistry is crucial for the design of transition metal complexes that serve as potentially sustainable proton reduction or H-2 oxidation catalysts, e.g., in electrolytic devices or fuel cells. However, even 20 years after the crystal structures of [FeFe]-hydrogenase have been published, several aspects of biological hydrogen turnover are heatedly discussed. In this perspective, we give an overview on how the diversity of naturally occurring and artificially prepared, semisynthetic [FeFe]-hydrogenases deepens our understanding of hydrogenase chemistry. In parallel, we cover recent results from biophysical techniques that go beyond the scope of conventional X-ray diffraction, EPR, and FTIR spectroscopy. Taking into account both proton transfer and electron transfer as well as the notorious sensitivity of [FeFe]-hydrogenase toward carbon monoxide, the discussion further touches upon the molecular proceedings of biological hydrogen turnover.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800007

The focus is on 1D and 2D nanomaterials, starting with carbon nanotubes, through graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides to black phosphorus, and closing the circle with graphene in 3D-printed materials. Through these examples, we show that detailed materials characterization is paramount prior to assigning catalytic properties to specific functionality. We show that while metallic impurities in nanocarbons and black phosphorus are often a source of perceived electrocatalysis of these materials, the different phase and valency impurities are often sources of electrocatalysis in transition metal dichalcogenides. These impurities should not be viewed negatively because if their amount is controlled, then they become dopants and can be beneficial for the intended applications of these nanomaterials.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800008

The coordination environments provided by the hemilabile amidate ligands were studied to reveal their spatial and electronic influence on the structures and energies of intermediates and transition states. Several factors contribute to the unique regioselectivity of this catalytic system, including orbital interactions, ligand coordination modes, and steric repulsion. The turnover-limiting step was found to be substrate-dependent. Experimental evidence was obtained to further test computationally generated hypotheses. These investigations show that the bis(amidate) Ti catalytic system's high regioselective performance can be attributed to ligand hemilability, which promotes metal-ligand cooperativity in the reaction mechanism.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800010

We report herein the achiral (CpIr)-Ir-x(IH)-catalyzed enantioselective C-H amidation of ferrocenes. Crucial to the high enantioselectivity is the use of a chiral carboxylic acid ligand derived from tert-leucine via Pd(II)-catalyzed gamma-C(sp(3))-H arylation and a sterically more hindered (CpIr)-Ir-x(III) catalyst. This reaction proceeds smoothly under very mild conditions (0 degrees C) and tolerates a wide range of ferrocene carboxamides and dioxazolones, providing the amidation products in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 97.5:2.5 er). This protocol might open the way for achiral (CpIr)-Ir-x(III)-catalyzed asymmetric C-H activation.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800012

Three dimensionally ordered macro-mesoporous (3DOMM) Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 oxide was synthesized by the combined methods of evaporation-induced interfacial self-assembly (EISA) and colloidal crystal templates (CCT). KMnOx nanoparticles (NPs) possess the natural microporous nanostructure of an octahedral molecular sieve (OMS) with an average size of 0.46 nm. Pt nanoclusters were anchored in situ at the microporous structure of KMnOx NPs and formed Pt-KMnOx active sites. For the OMMM Pt-Pt-KMnOx/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 catalyst, a 3D ordered macroporous (250 nm) structure can enhance contact efficiency between soot and catalysts, and a high specific surface area with contributions from ordered mesopores (5 nm) is beneficial for dispersion of KMnOx NPs and activation of gaseous reactants (O-2 and NO). Meanwhile, a microporous (0.46 nm) structure can anchor K sites and ultrafine Pt nanoclusters. The synergetic effect of ternary K-Mn-Pt components can transform gas reactants to the effective intermediate species and thereafter oxidize the well-dispersed soot particles. The OMMM Pt-KMnOx/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 catalyst possesses high catalytic activity and stability for soot oxidation under the conditions of loose contact: i.e., its TOF value is 2.10 h(-1) at 290 degrees C, which is more than a 4-fold increase over the 3DOMM Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 support (0.47 h(-1)). The architected hierarchical porous structure rationalizes an alternative protocol to improve solid-solid contact and the resulting activity, which can be further applied to other catalysis systems with different catalysts and reactants.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800013

Often, these simulations have relied on atomistic models where a single or a few conformational isomers of the complex are investigated. This Article will show that, for bisphosphine Ni complexes used to forge C-C bonds, a large number of conformers must be studied to provide confidence that the overall model is meaningful. Not only do conformer effects modify particular reaction barriers, but often the lowest barrier reaction pathway proceeds from a conformer that is not the lowest energy conformer. This finding suggests that errors on the order of more than a few kcal/mol could be present in single-conformer studies. The particular reaction pathway and conformer preferences for a series of eight common Ni bisphosphine complexes will provide some guidance as to when the effects of the conformer will be large or small.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800014

The defects mainly result from geo- metrical substitution of distinct Zn secondary building units for Zr counterparts on MTV-UiO-66 crystals. The as-synthesized HO-ZnZrO@C catalyst possesses rich surface oxygen vacancies on ultrafine ZnZrO nanoparticles, which are confined in robust 3D hierarchical carbon frameworks with open and successive channels. The HO-ZnZrO@C and hierarchical H-ZSM-5 tandem catalyst prepared by powder mixing not only affords a selectivity of aromatics up to 73.1% but also suppresses the CH4 selectivity down to 3.4% at a CO conversion of 35.2%. Particularly, we achieve a record-high space-time yield of 0.302 g g(oxide)(-1) h(-1) for methanol-mediated COx hydrogenation to aromatics with high catalytic stability. The 2,6-di-tert-butyl-pyridine adsorption FT-IR results indicate that the powder mixing mode between HO-ZnZrO@C and H-ZSM-5 decreases the number of external Bronsted acid sites on H-ZSM-5, which is beneficial for selective hydrogenation of intermediates to aromatics. Our strategy might open up an avenue for the rational design of highly open hierarchical nanostructures with targeted functionalities for various advanced applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800018

An Ir(III) complex equipped with a t-butyl cyclopentadienyl ligand and paired with a modified chiral proline enables the highly enantioselective sulfoxide-steered C-H bond activation, providing an efficient and straightforward way to construct sulfur chiral centers. A wide range of dibenzyl sulfoxides and dioxazolones are compatible with this process, giving access to a variety of highly functionalized sulfoxide compounds with synthetically attractive amide substitution groups in good yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, the flexible derivatization of the amidated sulfoxide was elaborated, providing various types of chiral sulfoxide scaffolds that would be potentially useful in asymmetric catalysis as chiral bidentate and tridentate ligands.									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800021

With a minimal amount of alkylaluminum required to activate the catalyst, polymerization kinetics is profoundly affected by the dosage of it. High dosage of alkylaluminum retards the polymerization but does not kill the catalyst. Through a comprehensive characterization on the samples by differential scanning calorimetry, crystallization elution fractionation, thermal gradient interaction chromatography, cross-fractionation chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance, it has been shown that alkylaluminum also alters the short-chain branching distribution (SCBD) of the copolymer but barely affects the total comonomer incorporation. It is proposed that alkylaluminum alters the active species from producing statistical copolymer chains to producing block polymer chains with C4-enriched and C4-scattered segments. It provides an example of a bimetallic structure of active species as well as an approach to tailor SCBD between a statistical copolymer and block copolymer bearing C4-enriched and C4-scattered segments.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800022

However, in real situations, a multitude of VOCs are present simultaneously. Other than the studies with photocatalyst design, the mechanisms of mutual effects between different VOCs and the complex reactions at the pollutants/photocatalyst interface are highly delicate to seek for the optimal routes for their decomposition and mineralization. In this work, a comprehensive analysis was made for the destruction of the formaldehyde (CH2O) and toluene (C7H8) mixture. The synergistic efficiency in the decomposition of the CH2O/C7H8 mixture was first established relative to its individual component. The photocatalytic efficiency was maintained for 8 h on the SnO2 photocatalyst, and the durability of the proposed photocatalyst was stable enough even after 30 days of exposure to air. Direct evidence for the synergistic effect on the destruction of the CH2O/C7H8 mixture composition is hypothesized. Most likely, the addition of CH2O into C7H8 turns out to be the rate-determining step in the ring-opening process to promote the decomposition reaction rates for the mixture. It was revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations that the CH2O addition leads to the generation of o-tolualdehyde as key intermediates, which elevated the adsorption and activation of the aromatic ring. This work may offer better insights into the practicality of photocatalysis technology in decomposition of key gaseous pollutants by endowing the "conventional" SnO2 photocatalyst with novel applications.									26	0	0	0	6	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800023

Here, we use periodic density functional theory and microkinetic modeling to systematically investigate the effect of surface structures on the conversion of furfuryl alcohol (FA). We consider nine surface terminations of Ni with various coordination numbers representing terrace, step, and corner sites. We study three reaction paths for FA conversion on various surfaces and find that the surface structure impacts the adsorption configuration and causes significant differences in selectivity. Barrier height analysis shows that terrace sites favor hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), whereas corner sites favor C-OH bond scission to produce 2-methylfuran (2-MF); step sites show similar barriers for the two reactions. We explain this by identifying three characteristics of the reactant adsorption structures that have a significant effect on selectivity, namely, that a shorter distance between the adsorbed hydrogen atom and the C3 carbon of FA favors hydrogenation to produce THFA, and more negative charge transfer to O-al(co)hol and a longer C-O-al(co)hol bond length favor C-O-al(co)hol bond scission to produce 2-MF. Since the reactions have similar barriers at a step site, microkinetic calculations are employed to calculate the product selectivity on a step site under experimental conditions. At lower temperatures and hiller generalized coordination number ((CN) over bar), THFA is the most favorable product, while the selectivity to 2-MF is higher at lower (CN) over bar and at higher temperature. This work provides guidance for the rational design catalysts to control the product distribution of FA conversion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800024		
J	Zhang, Tong; Lang, Xiuyao; Dong, Anqi; Wan, Xiang; Shan, Gao; Wang, Li; Wang, Linxia; Wang, Weichao								Difference of Oxidation Mechanism between Light C3-C4 Alkane and Alkene over Mullite YMn2O5 Oxides' Catalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	13			7269	7282		10.1021/acscatal.0c00703				JUL 2 2020	2020	Revealing the catalytic oxidation mechanism of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is insightful for the development of efficient catalysts. However, because of the complicated interactions and a large number of intermediate species during the reactions, the analysis of the entire reaction mechanism (including the activation modes of reactant molecules and the rate-limiting step) remains a great challenge. Herein, the YMn2O5 mullite catalyst was proposed to demonstrate how to distinguish the deep oxidation difference among C3-C4 alkanes and olefins via combining experiments and theoretical calculations. The YMn2O5 catalyst prepared via the hydrothermal method displayed a superior catalytic behavior with a low T-90 temperature (C3H8 at 250 degrees C; C3H6 , C4H10, and C4H8 less than 200 degrees C) (1000 ppm of C3-C4 and 10% O-2 balanced with He, WHSV = 30 000 mL/g.h). The catalytic activity remained the same after continuous reaction for 100 h at 275 degrees C for each reactant. Overall, the YMn2O5 mullite catalyst exhibits excellent durability with no activity declines for 400 h. Combined with TPD, DRIFTS, XPS, and DFT analysis, surface oxygen species were found to be active for the oxidation. Owing to the difference of the HOMO induced partial charge distributions between alkanes and alkenes, the dehydrogenation of the end-site C-H of propane is the first step prior to the crucial conversion of acrylate over surface labile oxygen in an octahedral ligand unit. For propene oxidation, the C=C double bond is preferentially attacked by two surface oxygen atoms belonging to the octahedral and pyramid ligand units with the crucial step of acetate decomposition. These findings provide insights into the oxide catalyst design toward the complicated VOCs oxidation from a fundamental point of view.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800027

However, this strategy requires developing a support that is electronically conductive, is stable in OER conditions, features a large specific surface area and a porosity adapted to gas-liquid flows. To address these challenges, we synthesized IrOx nanoparticles, supported them on doped SnO2 aerogels (IrOx/doped SnO2), and assessed their electrocatalytic activity toward the OER and their resistance to corrosion in acidic media by means of a flow cell connected to an inductively coupled mass spectrometer (FC-ICP-MS). The FC-ICP-MS results show that the long-term OER activity of IrOx/doped SnO2 aerogels is controlled by the resistance to corrosion of the doping element, and by its concentration in the host SnO2 matrix. In particular, we provide quantitative evidence that Sb-doped SnO2 supports continuously dissolve while Ta-doped or Nb-doped SnO2 supports with appropriate doping concentrations are stable under acidic OER conditions. These results shed fundamental light on the complex equilibrium existing between SnO2 and the doping element oxide. They also open a reliable path to develop highly active and robust IrOx nanocatalysts for OER in acidic media.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800028

This reaction tolerates diverse functionalities, such as C(sp(2))-Cl, fluoro, alkenyl, silyl, ether, thioether, pyrrolyl, and carbazolyl groups including cyclic and acyclic alkyls as well as alkyl-bearing fatty-alcohol and polycyclic-steroid moieties. The demonstrated iron-catalyzed protocol proceeded via either a five-membered or a six-membered metallacycle. Intriguingly, the C-7-alkylated indolines can be readily functionalized into free-NH indolines/indoles and tryptamine derivatives. A detailed mechanistic investigation highlights the participation of an active Fe(I) catalyst and the involvement of a halogen-atom transfer process via a single-electron-based mechanism. Deuterium labeling and kinetics analysis indicate that the C-H metalation of indoline is the probable turnover-limiting step. Overall, the experimental and theoretical studies supported an Fe(I)/Fe(III) pathway for the alkylation reaction comprising the two-step, one-electron oxidative addition of alkyl chloride.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800032

Specifically, the IrMo0.59 exhibits the highest catalytic activities, which are 5 times higher than that of Ir and commercial Pt/C toward HOR and even a 10-fold enhancement toward HER.

One of these clusters, the D-cluster, is surface-exposed and serves to transfer electrons between CODH and external redox partners. These enzymes tend to be extremely O-2-sensitive and are always manipulated under strictly anaerobic conditions. However, the CODH from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Dv) appears unique: exposure to micromolar concentrations of O-2 on the minutes-time scale only reversibly inhibits the enzyme, and full activity is recovered after reduction. Here, we examine whether this unusual property of Dv CODH results from the nature of its D-cluster, which is a [2Fe-2S] cluster, instead of the [4Fe-4S] cluster observed in all other characterized CODHs. To this aim, we produced and characterized a Dv CODH variant where the [2Fe-2S] D-cluster is replaced with a [4Fe-4S] D-cluster through mutagenesis of the D-cluster-binding sequence motif. We determined the crystal structure of this CODH variant to 1.83-A resolution and confirmed the incorporation of a [4Fe-45] D-cluster. We show that upon long-term O-2-exposure, the [4Fe-4S] Dcluster degrades, whereas the [2Fe-2S] D-cluster remains intact. Crystal structures of the Dv CODH variant exposed to O-2 for increasing periods of time provide snapshots of [4Fe-4S] D-cluster degradation. We further show that the WT enzyme purified under aerobic conditions retains 30% activity relative to a fully anaerobic purification, compared to 10% for the variant, and the WT enzyme loses activity more slowly than the variant upon prolonged aerobic storage. The D-cluster is therefore a key site of irreversible oxidative damage in Dv CODH, and the presence of a [2Fe-2S] D-cluster contributes to the O-2-tolerance of this enzyme. Together, these results relate O-2-sensitivity with the details of the protein structure in this family of enzymes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800034	32655979

As a model system, we study the reaction of benzylamines in acetonitrile over a potassium poly(heptazine imide) photocatalyst (K-PHI). We use CO2 or argon (Ar) to saturate the reaction solution and the reactor headspace, and blue light (461 nm) to drive the reaction. When compared to the more expensive Ar, CO2 boosts the conversion rate by creating a Imine Yield reaction intermediate with better electron donor properties. We also validate the influence of water content on the imine formation efficiency, and we observe higher catalytic activity of K-PHI, compared to a standard mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-CN).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800035

In order to achieve this, progress in the development of highly active and selective catalysts is fundamental. The combination of bimetallic nanoparticles and reactive support materials offers unique and complex interactions that can be exploited for improved catalyst performance. Here, we report on cobalt-nickel nanoparticles on reducible metal oxides as support material for enhanced performance in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. For this, different cobalt to nickel ratios (Ni/(Ni + Co): 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.0 atom/atom) supported on reducible (TiO2 and Nb2O5) or nonreducible (alpha-Al2O3) oxides were studied. At 1 bar, Co-Ni nanoparticles supported on TiO2 and Nb2O5 showed stable catalytic performance, high activities and remarkably high selectivities for long-chain hydrocarbons (C5+, similar to 80 wt %). In contrast, catalysts supported on alpha-Al2O3 independently of the metal composition showed lower activities, high methane production, and considerable deactivation throughout the experiment. At 20 bar, the combination of cobalt and nickel supported on reducible oxides allowed for 25-50% cobalt substitution by nickel with increased Fischer-Tropsch activity and without sacrificing much C5+ selectivity. STEM-EDX and IR of adsorbed CO pointed to a cobalt enrichment of the nanoparticle's surface and a weaker adsorption of CO in Co-Ni supported on TiO2 and Nb2O5 and not on alpha-Al2O3 , modifying the rate-determining step and the catalytic performance. Overall, we show the strong effect and potential of reducible metal oxides as support materials for bimetallic nanoparticles for enhanced catalytic performance.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800036	32655980

Developing an efficient reduced metal/acidic support with Lewis acidity is the key to facilitating the carbonyl hydrogenation and hydrolysis steps in the hydrogenative ring-rearrangement reaction. Herein, three pure Lewis acidic pyrochlore supports of the form A(2)B(2)O(7) (La2Sn2O7, Y2Sn2O7, and Y-2(Sn0.7Ce0.3)(2)O7-delta) with the same crystal structures and different metals are synthesized. The Lewis acidity and the surface properties of the pyrochlore can be tuned by inserting different kinds of A and B site metals. After impregnation, Pd nanoparticles with appropriate particle sizes are uniformly loaded on the surface of pyrochlore. For the reaction of the furanic aldehydes, all of these pyrochlore-based catalysts exhibit hydrogenation and hydrolysis rates that are both faster than those of traditional support-based catalysts due to the oxygen vacancy and pure Lewis acidity of the support. Among these pyrochlore-based catalysts, Pd/Y2Sn2O7 exhibits activity and selectivity that are higher than those of Pd/La2Sn2O7. Moreover, the Y2Sn2O7-based catalyst partially substituted by Ce3+ ions at the B site is more efficient, with the highest cyclopentanone yield and 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone yield of 95.0% and 92.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst can still maintain an effective activity and stability after 4 runs. This study not only presents an efficient biobased route for the production of cyclopentanone compounds but also focuses on the acid catalytic performance of pyrochlore based on its pure Lewis acidity.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800037

A broad range of linear 1-alkynes, cycloalkyl acetylenes, and aromatic alkynes undergo the hydrosilylation with HSiMe2Ph to afford the corresponding beta-(Z)-vinylsilanes in quantitative yields in short reaction times. The reaction of aliphatic alkynes with HSiEt3 is slower, resulting in a slight decrease of selectivity toward the beta-(Z)-vinylsilane product, which is still greater than 90%. However, a significant selectivity decrease is observed in the hydrosilylation of aromatic alkynes because of the beta-(Z) -> beta-(E) vinylsilane isomerization. Moreover, the hydrosilylation of bulky alkynes, such as t-Bu-C CH or Et3SiC CH, is unselective. Experimental evidence suggests that the carboxylate function plays a key role in the reaction mechanism, which has been validated by means of density functional theory calculations, as well as by mass spectrometry and labeling studies. On the basis of previous results, we propose an ionic outer- sphere mechanism pathway in which the carboxylate fragment acts as a silyl carrier. Namely, the hydrosilylation mechanism entails the heterolytic activation of the hydrosilane assisted by the carboxylate function to give the hydrido intermediate [Cp*RhH{(MeIm)(2)CHCOO-SiR3}]*. The transference of the silylium moiety from the carboxylate to the alkyne results in the formation of a flat beta-silyl carbocation intermediate that undergoes a hydride transfer from the Rh(III) center to generate the vinylsilane product. The outstanding beta-(Z) selectivity results from the minimization of the steric interaction between the silyl moiety and the ligand system in the hydride transfer transition state.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800038

However, thermal annealing usually induces detrimental particle sintering, which greatly offsets the performance enhancement. Although the mechanisms of particle sintering of monometallic Pt catalysts have been well studied, knowledge on the key factors controlling the particle sintering of Pt alloy catalysts is still very poor. Herein, we perform in situ heating (scanning) transmission electron microscopy of carbon-supported low-Pt alloy catalysts (PtFe3, PtCo3, and PtNi3) and reveal that the surface composition plays a key role in both the particle mobility and the coalescence process of the supported low-Pt nanoparticles (NPs) under high temperatures. A surface enrichment of the less-noble transition metals not only induces a faster particle coalescence due to enhanced surface diffusion, but also causes a higher mobility of the NPs on the carbon support due to a strong chemical interaction between the less-noble transition metals and the carbon support. In contrast, the Pt richer surface results in a lower NP mobility as well as slower surface diffusion across contact NPs, which contributes to a higher antisintering capability. Our results suggest that controlling the surface composition, for example, by engineering the elemental growth kinetics during nanoparticle synthesis, is critical for controlling the particle sintering of Pt alloy catalysts during thermal annealing.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800039

Herein, we show that a hybrid dual bed by packing a zeolite bed below the MnCr-ZSM-5 composite significantly enhances BTX formation. For instance, the BTX fraction in aromatics reaches over 80% when the second bed is beta zeolite and rises to 88% if an ultrastable Y zeolite (USY) is used. Studies show that the zeolite structure of three-dimensional (3D) channels of the 12-membered ring plays an important role in facilitating the BTX formation. Passivation of the external acid sites of zeolites further enhances the BTX selectivity. However, too much silica on the surface of ZSM-5 could narrow the pore opening and is detrimental for the diffusion of BTX, resulting in a lowered BTX selectivity. This hybrid catalyst system provides a promising strategy for direct production of BTX from syngas.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800040

While these applications have been traditionally seen as well-separated areas, recent examples have highlighted the possibility of coupling them. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous production of H-2 and naphthalene removal from aqueous solutions with (unoptimized) photonic efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.33%, respectively, over Pt-TiO2 under simulated sunlight. Photocatalytic and spin-trapping experiments in the presence of a hydroxyl radical and hole scavengers evinced that only the photogenerated holes play a significant role in the oxidation of naphthalene. Isotopic labeling analyses showed that the evolved H2 isotopologues match those of the solvent and that deuterated water (but not deuterated naphthalene) decreases the reaction rate, suggesting its involvement in the rate-determining step. Moreover, the use of TiO2 does not lead to the significant formation of O-18-enriched CO2, suggesting that water is the source of the oxygen atoms. Ultimately, by considering the stable and transient reaction intermediates, we propose a plausible reaction pathway. Our work illustrates that environmental remediation can be effectively coupled to solar fuel production, providing a double purpose to photocatalytic reactions, while the mechanistic insights will be of use for the further development of this strategy.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800041

In this contribution, the particle size effect on CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons over iron-based catalysts was deconvoluted into the effects on primary and secondary reactions. With a particle size range of 2.5-12.9 nm, the overall selectivity of C-2+ hydrocarbons increases continuously, while that of CO decreases with the increasing size. The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and methanation are the main primary reactions and they are more sensitive within a particle size range of 6.1-12.9 nm. The formation of formate species is more favored, and thereby more CH4 is produced as a primary product on larger particles. The secondary process, the further hydrogenation of primary CO to hydrocarbons, is more sensitive within the particle size range of 2.5-9.8 nm, where the geometric effect or ensemble effect on larger particles leads to a higher chain-growth probability. More terrace sites may be conducive for C-C coupling, and the enhanced CO adsorption also benefits the secondary process. These findings highlight the deconvoluted particle size effect on CO2 hydrogenation and provide a dimension for understanding the catalysts in complicated reaction networks.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800044

It contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and catalyzes the blue-light-dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids to generate the corresponding alkane. However, little is known about the catalytic mechanism of FAP, or how light is used to drive enzymatic decarboxylation. Here, we have used a combination of time-resolved and cryogenic trapping UV-visible absorption spectroscopy to characterize a red-shifted flavin intermediate observed in the catalytic cycle of FAP. We show that this intermediate can form below the "glass transition" temperature of proteins, whereas the subsequent decay of the species proceeds only at higher temperatures, implying a role for protein motions in the decay of the intermediate. Solvent isotope effect measurements, combined with analyses of selected site-directed variants of FAP, suggest that the formation of the red-shifted flavin species is directly coupled with hydrogen atom transfer from a nearby active site cysteine residue, yielding the final alkane product. Our study suggests that this cysteine residue forms a thiolate-flavin charge-transfer species, which is assigned as the red-shifted flavin intermediate. Taken together, our data provide insights into light-dependent decarboxylase mechanisms catalyzed by FAP and highlight important considerations in the (re)design of flavin-based photoenzymes.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800011	32905273

Among them, organic hydroperoxide resistance (Ohr) proteins play central roles in the bacterial response to fatty acid peroxides and peroxynitrite (Alegria et al. Ohr Plays a Central Role in Bacterial Responses against Fatty Acid Hydroperoxides and Peroxynitrite. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2017, 114, E132) and present distinct structural and biochemical features in comparison with mammalian Cys-based peroxidases. The molecular events associated with the high reactivity of Ohr enzymes toward hydroperoxides and its reducibility by lipoylated proteins (or dihydrolipoamide) are still elusive. Here, we report six crystallographic structures of two Ohr paralogs from Chromobacterium violaceum, including the complex with dihydrolipoamide. Comparison of these six structures with the other few Ohr structures available in public databases revealed conserved features in the active site, such as a hydrophobic collar. Together with classical, hybrid quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and point mutation analyses, we show that Ohr undergoes several structural switches to allow an energetically accessible movement of the loop containing the catalytic Arg, which is stabilized in the closed state when the catalytic Cys is reduced. The structure of Ohr in complex with its substrate (dihydrolipoamide) together with molecular simulations allowed us to characterize the reductive half of the catalytic pathway in detail. Notably, dihydrolipoamide favors Arg-loop closure, thereby assisting enzyme turnover. The conserved physicochemical properties of the Ohr active site and the mechanisms revealed here provide relevant information for the identification of inhibitors with therapeutic potential.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800001

Site-specific cleavage and functionalization of a saturated C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bond via a visible-light-induced radical process have been achieved. The general features of this reaction are as follows. (1) Both linear and cyclic C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bonds with a vicinal arene can be specifically functionalized. (2) One carbon is converted into a ketone, and another can be tunably converted into nitrile, peroxide, or halide. (3) The typical conditions include 1.0 mol % of Ru(bpy)(3)Cl-2, 1.0 or 5.0 equiv of Zhdankin reagent, white CFL (24 W), open flask, and room temperature. These reactions offer powerful tools to modify carbon skeletons that are intractable by conventional methods. Good selectivity and functional group tolerance, together with mild and open air conditions, make these transformations valuable and attractive.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800002

Two catalyst supports, MgAl(2)O(4 )and MgAl2O4, have been studied in fresh and reduced state to determine the effect of high-temperature H-2 reduction upon ion distribution in the lattices. To this end, an X-ray Raman scattering study has been performed, focusing on the oxygen K edge and magnesium and aluminum L-2,L-3 and iron M(2,3 )soft edges. MgAl(2)O(4 )shows a random cation distribution and only small changes occur at the Mg L-2,L-3 and Al L-2,L-3 edges upon reduction at 1073 K. The main oxygen signal does lose intensity and its simulation points to a lower O covalency and more confined state after reduction. Introducing 8.9 wt % Fe into the spinel pushes Mg towards mostly tetrahedral position in the MgAl2O4 lattice, whereas Fe and Al share the octahedral sites. Concomitant lattice distortion is observable in the O signal. Reduction of MgAl2O4 leads to enhanced distortion visible in the O and Al signals and the presence of 50% Fe2+. Both disorder and reduction lead to partial segregation of MgFeOx from the MgAl2O4 lattice. This combination of distortion and phase restructuring in the Fe-modified MgAl2O4 material facilitates the lattice oxygen mobility and hence its catalytic activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800003

Extending ZSM-5 stability under these conditions was studied using silylation, hydrothermal carbonization, and sequential hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis treatments. Coatings resulting from silylation and hydrothermal carbonization were not hydrothermally stable at temperatures greater than 300 degrees C. In comparison, the coating formed by sequential hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis was thermally stable at temperatures as great as 550 degrees C and hydrothermally stable in the presence of a supercritical water phase at 400 degrees C. The carbon-coated ZSM-5 (termed C-ZSM-5) was studied for stability and activity for dodecane cracking in supercritical water. C-ZSM-5 exhibited similar cracking activity compared with ZSM-5 while retaining more crystallinity and Bronsted acid sites (BAS) density. The C-ZSM-5 failure mechanism is the disruption of the carbon-zeolite interface during use. C-ZSM-5 has the potential for extending zeolite stability in liquid water at more severe conditions than previously examined.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800004

However, typical binary metal-salen complex/ionic salt systems suffer from an unavoidable transesterification reaction, which degrades the polymer backbone and changes the polymer properties. We herein describe the precise synthesis of polythioesters from the copolymerization of cyclic thioanhydrides and epoxides by an intramolecular acid-base cooperative catalysis strategy, which can significantly suppress side reactions. The bifunctional catalyst composed of Lewis acidic Cr-salen complex with a covalently tethered 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4,4,0]dec-5-ene (TBD, a sterically hindered strong Lewis base) successfully suppressed the transesterification reaction even at low concentrations, yielding polythioesters with completely alternating structures, controlled molecular weights, and low dispersities. Mechanistic studies revealed that polymer chain propagation was predominantly proceeded by intramolecular alternating enchainment between the Lewis acid-activated epoxide and the Lewis base-mediated cyclic thioanhydride.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800005

A comprehensive mechanistic investigation of the effect of the reaction parameters (initiator structure, halide, Cu catalyst, ligand, solvent, temperature, reagent ratios, ATRP method, etc.) on the polymerization outcome (kinetics, dependence of the molecular weight (M-n) polydispersity (PDI), and halide chain end functionality (CEF) on conversion) affords a quantitative understanding of diene ATRP and reveals that despite drawbacks such as low boiling point, Diels-Alder dimerization, a very low polymerization rate, and especially, a very weak and side-reaction-prone allyl halide chain end, a rational selection of the polymerization conditions (normal- or ICAR (initiators for continuous activator regeneration)-ATRP, tertiary bromoester initiators, low nucleophilicity ligands including bipyridyl, nonpolar solvents such as toluene at 110-130 degrees C), still enables the synthesis of well-defined polybutadiene (PBD) with a wide range of .114 n values (1000-100000), low PDIs (1.3-1.5) and high Br-CEFs (>90%), suitable for the synthesis of complex architectures including star PBD and ABA triblock copolymers with styrene and methyl methacrylate.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800006

In this study, we describe the fabrication of an anthraquinone functionalized COF linked by beta-ketoenamines (AQ-COF), which presents a noodle-like nanofiber structure with staggered AB stacking mode. The as-resultant AQ-COF was efficiently utilized as a metal-free heterogeneous catalyst for selective aerobic oxidation of sulfides under visible-light irradiation. Compared with the precedential AQ-COFDMF with spherical particles, the proposed AQ-COF presents a higher photocatalytic activity with high selectivity to sulfoxides and chemical stability. Further characterization techniques revealed that the unique morphology and structure can greatly enhance charge transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus giving rise to the improvement of photocatalytic activity.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800007

ACS CATALYSIS				10	12			6682	6690		10.1021/acscatal.0c00220				JUN 19 2020	2020	Metal bound isobenzopyrylium species are proposed as reactive intermediates in transition-metal-catalyzed [3 + 2] or [4 + 2] cyclizations of o-alkynylbenzaldehydes (enynals) or o-alkynylarylketones (enynones). Because of their high reactivity, isolation and structural characterization of such intermediates have remained elusive. Herein, we report the isolation of such gold(I)and gold(III)-bound isobenzopyrylium intermediates, and two of them have been characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. When reacting with reaction partners, such as styrene and phenyl acetylene, the Au(I) intermediate exhibited a reaction rate much faster than that of the Au(III) species. A degradation pathway of active Au(III)-carbene intermediate was observed, leading to release of Au(I) species and consequent formation of a dichloride compound. In other related catalytic reactions, the Au(I) intermediate could react well with a range of cyclization partners, whereas the Au(III) intermediate did not work. The above observations indicate that Au(I) species is probably the real catalyst in such gold-catalyzed transformations of o-alkynylbenzaldehydes and o-alkynylarylketones.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800010

The popular oxidant used is molecular O-2, and the alternative soft oxidant, CO2 with better selectivity, is difficult to activate and has been less addressed. It is expected that porous BN with plenty of active edges result in an improved activity, and a clarified reaction mechanism can also guide the rational design of efficient CO2-mediated dehydrogenation (O-2 DH) catalysts. Herein, the hierarchical porous BN (hpBN, 657-785 m(2)/g) with nearly uniform mesopores (similar to 22 nm) and rich exposed edges is derived from an "evaporation-assembly"-like pyrolytic approach. Its high synthetic temperature or reductive atmosphere leads to a suppressed edge -BOx degree as well as a decreased styrene production activity. Combined with the decreased N-H signal below 300 degrees C, enhanced B-O signals, BOC, BOCO, and the carboxylate-like bonds suggested by the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra, the CO2 DH activities and -BOx are found to be correlated. The depressed activity, enhanced C-C bond cleavage, and activity loss of the supported B2O3 catalyst can be attributed to its strong acidity and weak binding. According to the density functional theory calculations and experimental results, the reaction routes are estimated. The O atom of CO2 can be bonded to the exposed B edge of BN; then, the >BO-CO bond cleavage happens along with the alpha/beta-H of EB followed by styrene/CO/>BOH production or with the help of a nearby oxygen radical/OH group in a stepwise manner. It is suggested that the concerted route is more favored, and the coexistence of DDH and ODH might originate from -BOH dehydration or dehydrogenation.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800012

The ion pair generated from alcohol and a catalytic amount of P-4-t-Bu was vital for the successful implementation of this stereoselective glycosylation under mild conditions, producing moderate to good yields. Under reported reaction conditions, 2-nitrogalactals produce alpha-stereoisomers exclusively, while 2-nitroglucal yielded more beta-products. The notable difference between the outcomes was investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) study. In addition, we have synthesized the key intermediate of a mucin-type core-6 glycoconjugate, thus illustrating the synthetic potency of this method.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800013

Application to the Catalysis of Electrochemical Alcohol Oxidation in Water								ACS CATALYSIS				10	12			6716	6725		10.1021/acscatal.0c01195				JUN 19 2020	2020	Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) catalysts are investigated in the framework of cyclic voltammetry (CV). We analyze homogeneous catalysts and provide a detailed formal kinetic analysis of the various responses expected in the case of a PCET catalyst following either stepwise or concerted pathways. Both buffered solution and nonbuffered aqueous media are considered. In the first case we show that, in addition to possible limitation by buffer diffusion, the PCET sequence may be rate limiting. The CV wave shape, position, and intensity are discussed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic penalties associated with each mechanism. In the second case, we show that a nonclassical pseudo-canonical cyclic voltammogram with hysteresis due to hydronium production is obtained for a Nernstian PCET catalyst with water as the proton acceptor. Thermodynamic and kinetic penalties resulting from water-based PCET specific pathways are analyzed. Finally, we use the present analysis to investigate the electrochemical catalysis of alcohol oxidation in water with a PCET catalyst, N-hydroxyphthalimide. We have found that the rate constant for benzyl alcohol oxidation is independent of pH, strongly suggesting a true hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as the ratedetermining step. When water is the proton acceptor to generate the active form of the catalyst, i.e. N-oxyl PINO radical, the catalytic process follows a stepwise PTET pathway whose kinetics partially limits the catalytic current.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800014

We employ a minimal microkinetic model that incorporates the influence of plasma-activation on N-2 dissociation rates to predict NH3 yields into and across the equilibrium-limited regime. NH3 yields are predicted to exceed bulk thermodynamic equilibrium limits on materials that are thermal-rate-limited by N-2 dissociation. In all cases, yields revert to bulk equilibrium at temperatures at which thermal reaction rates exceed plasma-activated ones. Beyond-equilibrium NH3 yields are observed in a packed bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor and exhibit sensitivity to catalytic material choice in a way consistent with model predictions. The approach and results highlight the opportunity to exploit synergies between nonthermal plasmas and catalysts to affect transformations at conditions inaccessible through thermal routes.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800015

Compared with classical offline product analysis, the electrolyte characterization near the electrode favors the formation of aldehydes versus alcohols. When the CO2 reduction takes place in the presence of an aldehyde, the formation of the respective alcohol is enhanced, both in terms of onset potentials and partial current densities. The above imply that aldehydes and alcohols are formed sequentially. All determined products are formed at lower overpotential on oxide-derived copper, indicating that the electrode treatment generates different, more active sites. Overall, the presented methodology based on proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry can complement hard electron ionization by monitoring the transient formation of liquid products under dynamic conditions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800016

Here we report a comparative study of a series of earth-abundant cobalt-based spinel oxide (MCo2O4 , M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) nanostructures as robust electrocatalysts for the glycerol oxidation to selectively produce formic acid. Their intrinsic catalytic activities in alkaline solution follow the sequence of CuCo2O4 > NiCo2O4 > CoCo2O4 > FeCo2O4 > ZnCo2O4 > MnCo2O4 . Using the best-performing CuCo2O4 catalyst directly integrated onto carbon fiber paper electrodes for the bulk electrolysis reaction of glycerol oxidation (pH = 13) at the constant potential of 1.30 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a high selectivity of 80.6% for formic acid production and an overall Faradaic efficiency of 89.1% toward all value-added products were achieved with a high glycerol conversion of 79.7%. Various structural characterization techniques confirm the stability of the CuCo2O4 catalyst after electrochemical testing. These results open up opportunities for studying earth-abundant electrocatalysts for efficient and selective oxidation of glycerol to produce formic acid or other value-added chemicals.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800017

However, the development of facile and controllable routes for obtaining nanostructured TMOS under ambient conditions still remains a significant challenge. Here we report a simple and controllable route to synthesize nanoparticles of tungsten oxysulfides (WOxSy) that exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward HER with outstanding stability. The sulfur-rich tungsten oxysulfides with engineered anionic species can offer multiple functionalities, including abundant active sites and improved conductivity that synergistically contribute to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER The optimized WOxSy, electrocatalyst shows low overpotential of 103 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with a Tafel slope of 54 mV decade' and 5.89 x 10(-2) mA cm(-2) exchange current density. Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations further establish the improved catalytic activity of tungsten oxysulfide (WOxSy), compared to the pristine 1T-WS2, based on the free energy calculations.

While Pt typically catalyzes the complete hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes, a catalyst comprising a nominal one monolayer (ML) Pt shell on titanium tungsten nitride cores (Pt/TiWN) is capable of net C2H4 generation under industrial front-end reaction conditions featuring a large excess of C2H4 and H-2. Microcalorimetry measurements are consistent with a change in the Pt electronic structure that decreases C2H4 binding strength, thus increasing partial hydrogenation selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) both indicate broadening of the Pt d-band and concomitant down-shifting of the d-band center. The ability to control shell coverage and core composition opens up extensive opportunities to modulate the electronic and catalytic properties of noble metal-based catalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800019

This aqueous-phase etherification reaction occurs with higher selectivity on H-BEA (95%) than on Amberlyst-15 (76%), H-FAU (64%), H-MFI (88%), and H-MOR (63%) at high conversions (>60%). This selectivity toward EMF is not driven by transport limitations or Bronsted acid site concentrations; instead, a kinetic preference for etherification on BEA leads to such high yields. Nonidealities associated with the liquid-phase reaction are addressed by using UNIFAC-derived activities rather than concentrations, and reaction kinetics measurements indicate that the reaction proceeds on a surface saturated by ethanol with rates that are first order with respect to HMF activity and negative order with respect to ethanol activity. Gas-phase density functional theory calculations are unified with aqueous liquid-phase kinetics measurements by using partial pressures of a hypothetical gas phase calculated from UNIFAC-derived activities. DFT calculations indicate that etherification occurs in a single concerted step-rather than through a two-step sequential pathway-in which HMF is protonated and dehydrated to form a relatively stable methoxyfurfural carbocation (in contrast to ethanol dehydration). This methoxyfurfural carbocation is stabilized by resonance in contrast to ethyl carbocations formed from ethanol protonation and dehydration, and it also leads to the observed high selectivity for cross-etherification (to EMF) vs self-etherification of either HMF or ethanol. This rigorous mechanistic investigation uses gas-phase DFT calculations to offer insights into aqueous-phase catalysis, thereby elucidating an important reaction in biomass upgrading.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800020

The resulting alkylidene loss has been assumed to be irreversible. Yet, by reacting (SIMes)(eta(6)-p-cymene)RuCl2 (1), the p-cymene-stabilized alkylidene-free fragment resulting from loss of propene from Ru-2, with ethylene, we show that the methylidene analogue of GII (GIIm) and other Ru alkylidenes are formed, along with catalytic amounts of propene and butenes, and can be stabilized by tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) at SO degrees C in C6D6. An almost 20-fold increase in activity for ring-closing metathesis of diethyl diallylmalonate (DEDAM) on pretreatment of 1 with ethylene suggests that the reversibility of the alkylidene loss may be used to develop longer-lived metathesis catalysts and processes. Mechanistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the connection between 1 and GIIm involves oxidative coupling of two ethylene molecules to form a key metallacyclopentane intermediate (M49). A 1,2-H shift in M49 gives the methyl-substituted ruthenacyclobutane M303, which, on cycloreversion, liberates propene and GlIm. Alternatively, successive H-shifts starting in M49 may give 1-butene (fast reaction) and 2-butene (slower) with a lower barrier than that of Ru alkylidene. The lower predicted barrier is consistent with butene, especially 1-butene, being the dominating product at the start of the experiments, in particular at lower temperature.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800022

Here, we demonstrate the use of caffeine as a "double-layer dopant" to enhance both the HER and HOR of Pt electrodes in base. HER/HOR rates increase by 5-fold on Pt(111) and are accelerated on Pt(110), Pt(pc), and Pt/C as well. FTIR spectroscopy confirms that caffeine is adsorbed at the Pt surface, forming a self-limiting film through electrochemical deposition. Caffeine films are stable up to 1.0 V vs RHE and are readily regenerated through caffeine deposition during load/potential cycling. The findings presented here both identify a potential catalyst additive that can mitigate high Pt loadings in alkaline fuel cells and electrolyzers while opening the door to molecular engineering of solid/liquid interfaces for energy storage and conversion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800023

Herein, a series of FexMn3-xO4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized, derived from Mn-Fe bimetallic MOFs. The Fe0.35Mn2.65O4 NPs exhibit a NO conversion up to 90% at 180 degrees C in an ultrahigh GHSV of 400 000 h(-1). An efficient Fe-oct-O-M-tet site is revealed, and the formation energy of oxygen vacancy on the Fe-oct-O-M-tet site is the lowest, which is the rate-determining step of NO oxidation. The high NO oxidation activity can trigger the "fast SCR" reaction, thus leading to the boosted NH3-SCR performance. This work provides not only an approach to construct NH3-SCR catalysts with high intrinsic activity but also the potential to resolve industrial challenges related to NO catalytic reduction.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800024

The reaction requires a substoichiometric amount of base and produces only water as a byproduct. Several pharmaceutically relevant functional groups such as piperidine, morpholine, etc. are well-tolerated under the reaction conditions to give higher value-added products in one step from widely available substrates. The reaction proceeds through a sulfone carbanion addition to an in-situ-generated aldehyde formed via catalytic dehydrogenation and subsequent catalyst-mediated replacement of the secondary alcohol by hydrogen.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800025

Here we report on the critical aspect of interconnectivity of multicomponents in hierarchical zeolite catalysts using a combined gravimetric and infrared spectroscopy (AGIR) analysis. The variances of macroscopic diffusion behaviors between the global multicomponent catalyst (indexed as global diffusion time constant) and its zeolitic moiety (indexed as micropore diffusion time constant) are differentiated via simultaneous gravimetric and infrared analysis, respectively. The effectiveness factors correlated with the diffusion time constants show that the nonideal interconnectivity between the zeolitic and nonzeolitic components weakens the full potential of the multicomponent catalyst.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800027

If the product ACE is hydrogenated, IPA is formed again. In this way, IPA serves as a rechargeable electrofuel. In this work, we study the oxidation of IPA at Pt electrodes using several complementary experimental methods, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical real-time mass spectrometry (EC-RTMS), and electrochemical infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (EC-IRRAS), in combination with density functional theory (DFT) to assign the vibrational modes of IPA and ACE. Different types of Pt electrodes are investigated, namely single crystalline Pt(111) surfaces, polycrystalline Pt, and nanostructured tubular Pt electrodes. The onset of the IPA oxidation on the Pt electrodes is observed at 0.3 VIE, yielding ACE with high selectivity. At potentials above 0.9 V-RHE, the formation of Pt oxide inhibits the reaction. The only side reaction observed is the formation of small amounts of CO2. We show that adsorbed ACE is formed at the Pt electrodes poisoning the surface. On nanotubular electrodes with high surface area, ACE stays mainly adsorbed on the surface, and only a small fraction desorbs. These observations suggest that poisoning of the Pt electrode by adsorbed ACE limits the oxidation of IPA.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800028

Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control Determine the Sesquiterpene Reaction Pathways Inside Nanocapsules								ACS CATALYSIS				10	12			6843	6853		10.1021/acscatal.0c00278				JUN 19 2020	2020	Terpene and terpenoid syntheses are challenging tasks because of the required multiple synthetic steps, exact functionalization, and difficult purification that reduce the yields. One of the propitious methods to tackle this problem is the synthesis of terpenes inside nanocapsules. Nanocapsules based on resorcinarene moieties have recently been employed experimentally to generate sesquiterpenes, but the improvement of product distribution control in such nanoreactors is currently challenging due to a lack Thermodynamic of specificity. In the current work, we study the in-capsule reactions employing multiscale & Kinetic Control modeling techniques along with a high-temperature Langevin molecular dynamics simulation protocol as well as the potential of mean force using the umbrella sampling technique. Additionally, we generate a sesquiterpene database with information derived from quantum chemical calculations. Using these methods, we shed light on thermodynamics, kinetics, product selectivity, and the chemical mechanism of sesquiterpene formation inside the resorcinarene-based nanocapsule. We find that, although the capsule produces many of the most stable known sesquiterpenes, several very stable sesquiterpenes are not formed. We ascribe this to reaction mechanisms involving intrinsically high energy secondary cations, which are avoided, even in the capsule. The current reaction modeling approach is expected to aid in the design of synthetic strategies for in-capsule sesquiterpene production.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800029

In microorganisms, the MoFe catalytic protein of nitrogenase is reduced by a transient Fe protein binding and separate hydrolysis of ATP. However, the requirement of 16 ATP molecules by the Fe protein for the 8 electron transfer is an energy-intense caveat to the enzymatic synthesis of NH3 and is challenging from an electrochemical perspective. Thus, we report the redox polymer-based ATP-free mediated electron-transfer system of MoFe nitrogenase using cobaltocene-functionalized poly(allylamine) Cc-PAA), which is able to reduce the MoFe nitrogenase directly with a low redox potential of -0.58 V vs SHE. An efficient immobilization of MoFe nitrogenase via Cc-PAA allowed for the bioelectrocatalytic reduction of N-3(-), NO2-, and N-2 to NH3. Bulk bioelectrosynthetic experiments produced 7 +/- 2 and 30 +/- 5 nmol of NH3 from NO2- and N-3(-) reduction for 30 min, respectively. In addition, biosynthetic N-2 reduction to NH3 was confirmed by N-15(2) labeling experiments with NMR analysis. This mediated electrontransfer approach of the immobilized nitrogenase using the Cc-PAA redox polymer provides a valuable technological basis for scaleup and industrial uses in the future of bioelectrosynthesis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800030

NHC-bound nucleophiles known as Breslow intermediates can be obtained by reacting an NHC catalyst with an aldehyde and will add to carbon-heteroatom or carbon-carbon double bonds. On the other hand, the substitution-type crosscouplings of carbon electrophiles (that is, R-X species) with NHC-bound nucleophiles to generate carbon-carbon bonds have also been demonstrated even though such processes are difficult and less mature at present. This Perspective briefly summarizes the NHC-based catalysis enabling cross-coupling reactions. Three types of systems are examined: anionic, hybrid, and radical catalysis.									55	1	0	0	14	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800031

The photo/electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted increasing interests recently, providing alternative routes to realize green NH3 synthesis. Despite rapid advances achieved in this most attractive research field, the unsatisfactory conversion efficiency including a low NH3 yield rate, and limited Faradaic efficiency or apparent quantum efficiency still remains as a great challenge. The NRR performance is intrinsically related to the electronic and surface structure of catalysts. Rational design and preparation of advanced catalysts are indispensable to improve the performance (e.g., activity and selectivity) of NRR. In this Review, various strategies for the development of desirable catalysts are comprehensively summarized, mainly containing the defect engineering, structural manipulation, crystallographic tailoring, and interface regulation. State-of-the-art heterogeneous NRR catalysts, prevailing theories and underlying catalytic mechanisms, together with current issues, critical challenges, and perspectives are discussed. It is highly expected that this Review will promote the understanding of recent advances in this area and stimulate greater interests for designing promising NRR catalysts in future.									55	0	0	0	2	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800032

This likely implies the presence of sizable errors in the gas-phase energetics. Here, we take a step closer toward chemical accuracy with a semiempirical method to correct the gas-phase energetics of PBE, PW91, RPBE, and BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation functionals. The proposed two-step method is tested on a data set of 27 gas-phase molecules belonging to the carbon cycle: first, the errors are pinpointed based on formation energies, and second, the respective corrections are sequentially applied to ensure the progressive lowering of the data set's mean and maximum errors. We illustrate the benefits of the method in electrocatalysis by a substantial improvement of the calculated equilibrium and onset potentials for CO2 reduction to CO on Au, Ag, and Cu electrodes. This suggests that fast and systematic gas-phase corrections can be devised to augment the predictive power of computational catalysis models.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800033

The atomic-level morphology of a rough electrode is likely one key factor responsible for its comparatively high catalytic selectivity and activity. However, few methods are capable of probing the atomic-level structure of rough metal electrodes under electrocatalytic conditions. As a result, the nuances in the atomic-level surface morphology that control the catalytic characteristics of these electrodes have remained largely unexplored. Because the C O stretching frequency of atop-bound CO (COatop) depends on the coordination of the underlying metal atom, the IR spectrum of this reaction intermediate on the copper electrode could, in principle, provide structural information about the catalytic surface during electrolysis. However, other effects, such as dynamic dipole coupling, easily obscure the dependence of the frequency on the surface morphology. Further, in the limit of low COatop coverage, where coupling effects are small, the C O stretching frequencies of COatop on Cu(111) and Cu(100) facets are virtually identical. Therefore, on the basis of the C O stretching frequency, it is not straightforward to distinguish between these two ubiquitous surface facets, which exhibit vastly different CO reduction activities. Herein, we show that key features of the atomic-level surface morphology of rough copper electrodes can be inferred from the potential dependence of the line shape of the C O stretching band of COatop. Specifically, we compared two types of rough copper thin-film electrodes that are routinely employed in the context of surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS). We found that copper films that are electrochemically deposited on Si-supported Au films (CuAu-Si) are poor catalysts for the reduction of CO to ethylene in comparison to copper films (Cu-Si) that are electrolessly deposited onto Si crystals. As quantified by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), the onset potential for ethylene is similar to 200 +/- 65 mV more cathodic for CuAu-Si than that for Cu-Si. To reveal the origin of the disparate catalytic properties of Cu-Si and CuAu-Si, we probed the surfaces of the electrodes with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and SEIRAS. The CV characterization suggests that the (111) surface facet predominates on CuAu-Si, whereas the (100) facet is more common on Cu-Si. SEIRAS reveals that the line shape of the C O stretching of COatop is composed of two bands that are attributable to COatop on terrace and defect sites. The different surface structures manifest themselves in the form of starkly different potential dependences of the line shape of the C O stretching mode of COatop on the two types of electrodes. With a simple Boltzmann model that considers the different adsorption energies of COatop on terrace and defect sites, and the resulting COatop populations on terrace and defect sites, we deduced that the observed electrode-specific potential dependence of the line shape is consistent with the presence of different predominant terrace sites on the two types of films.This strategy for assessing the atomic-level morphology is not restricted to SEIRAS but could also be applied to the C O stretching bands recorded with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which is suitable for probing a wide range of rough copper electrodes. Therefore, with this work, we establish the potential dependence of the C O stretching band of COatop as a probe of the atomic-level surface structure of rough metal electrodes under electrochemical conditions. When it is coupled with complementary techniques, this methodology provides essential structural information for further improvement in the reaction selectivity of rough metal electrodes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800034

This direct process eliminates the unnecessary protecting-group manipulations that are required with N-substituted (N-protected) imines and can contribute to the development of green chemistry. Although their use has been limited due to difficulties associated with the nature of N-unsubstituted imines, recently developed catalytic methods enable the use of N-unsubstituted imines as electrophiles in various catalytic addition reactions. To facilitate an understanding of the state of the art development of synthetic methodologies, herein we review recent progress on catalytic addition reactions to N-unsubstituted imines.

This is confirmed from rate assessments, detailed kinetic analysis accounting for active site loss, isotopic tracer studies, and detailed spectroscopic characterization. Irrespective of the oxidant's chemical identity, the C2H6 activation cycle occurs via the kinetically relevant C-H bond activation of C2H6 on lattice oxygen of MoOx , forming C2H4 . The concomitant oxidant activation cycle either replenishes the oxygen vacancies or generates reactive oxygen species, which scavenge unwanted carbonaceous debris deposited on catalyst surfaces at contents dictated by the chemical identity of the oxidant and oxygen chemical potential that it exerts. Among the oxidants, O(2 )is the most effective, as it removes coke effectively, leading to essentially no rate decay. CO2 and H2O are alternate soft oxidants, and their use prevents the overoxidation of ethylene, thus resulting in higher ethylene selectivity (80-85%) than using O-2 . CO2 activation is, however, severely restricted kinetically, as evidenced from the reverse water-gas shift reaction that is far away from chemical equilibrium; thus, the generation of reactive oxygen species and their ability to concomitantly oxidize coke are much less effective than those with O-2 oxidant. H2O dissociation is rapid and quasi-equilibrated, but its activation converts a portion of the active lattice oxygen to hydroxy species, reducing the active oxygen centers and lowering C2H6 turnovers. The rates of the C2H6 activation cycle dictate the intrinsic rates, whereas those of the concomitant oxidant activation and carbon removal cycles dictate the surface lattice oxygen density available for catalysis and in turn the extent of rate decay. Consolidating these findings within a generalized mechanistic framework leads to a universal rate expression containing two terms, one accounting for an intrinsic C2H6 activation rate and a second one for the time-dependent rate decay. This universal rate expression captures the kinetic properties of early transition-metal oxides in C2H6 catalysis, irrespective of the chemical identity of the oxidant.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800036

We also identified the reverse glycosylation activities of PmHS2, which complicated its application in size-controlled synthesis of oligosaccharides longer than hexasaccharide. Engineered Delta 80PmHS2 single-function-glycosyltransferase mutants Delta 80PmHS2_D291N (alpha 1-4-GlcNAcT lacking both forward and reverse beta 1-4-GlcAT activities) and Delta 80PmHS2_D569N (beta 1-4-GlcAT lacking both forward and reverse a1-4-GlcNAcT activities) were designed and showed to minimize side product formation. They were successfully used in a sequential one-pot multienzyme (OPME) platform for size-controlled high-yield production of oligosaccharides up to decasaccharide. The study draws attention to the consideration of reverse glycosylation activities of glycosyltransferases, including polysaccharide synthases, when applying them in the synthesis of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. The mutagenesis strategy has the potential to be extended to other multifunctional polysaccharide synthases with reverse glycosylation activities to generate catalysts with improved synthetic efficiency.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900016	33520345

The cavity was found to be responsible for a triple selectivity: (i) the asymmetric shape of the cavity of beta-ICyD induced highly stereoselective cyclizations, (ii) the shape of the interior favored the formation of a six-membered ring in the absence of a nucleophile, and finally, (iii) the encapsulation of the metal inside the cavity disfavored the addition of sterically hindered alcohols. Highly enantioselective and substrate-selective alkoxycyclizations of enynes are therefore promoted by the cavity-based molecular reactor (beta-ICyD)AuCl.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900002

Herein, we report the fabrication of a hollow mesoporous MOF with hollow macroporous core and mesoporous shell, featuring a hierarchical porous structure that allows fast diffusion of reactants. The hollow core and mesoporous shell of the MOF were achieved by an elaborate design of a bimetallic MOF with stability differences in both metal-ligand bonds and spatial distribution via a boosted nucleation process, followed by selective etching treatment. Impressively, the hollow mesoporous MOF greatly enhanced the mass diffusion within the framework, which is demonstrated by the diffusion experiments, the molecular dynamics simulation, and the catalytic reaction by using 4-chlorostyrene as a probe. In addition, the as-prepared hollow mesoporous MOF exhibited superior catalytic performance when utilized as a Pd nanoparticles carrier, compared with solid Pd/MOF and commercial Pd/C catalysts toward benzyl alcohol oxidation.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900003

However, little progress has been made on the improvement of the intrinsic activity of ORR catalysts; consequently, the widespread use of fuel cells is still limited by low energy efficiency. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the fundamentals underlying the ORR on platinumbased catalysts as well as metal-nitrogen-carbon nonprecious metal catalysts. We also report the diporphyrin complexes as promising catalysts with outstanding activity owing to structural advantages. In particular, diporphyrin anthracene (DPA) with optimized ligand coordination has a low barrier to dissociate O-2 molecules at the optimal oxygen adsorption energy region, which might unlock overpotentials of less than 0.2 V.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900004

Diastereoselective sp(3) C-O Bond Formation via Visible Light-Induced, Copper-Catalyzed Cross-Couplings of Glycosyl Bromides with Aliphatic Alcohols								ACS CATALYSIS				10	11			5990	6001		10.1021/acscatal.0c01470				JUN 5 2020	2020	Copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have become one of the most powerful methods for generating carbonheteroatom bonds, an important framework of many organic molecules. However, copper-catalyzed C(sp(3))-O cross-coupling of alkyl halides with alkyl alcohols remains elusive because of the sluggish nature of oxidative addition to copper. To address this challenge, we have developed a catalytic copper system, which overcomes the copper oxidative addition barrier with the aid of visible light and effectively facilitates the cross-couplings of glycosyl bromides with aliphatic alcohols to afford C(sp(3))-O bonds with high levels of diastereoselectivity. Importantly, this catalytic system leads to a mild and efficient method for stereoselective construction of alpha-1,2-cis glycosides, which are of paramount importance, but challenging. In general, stereochemical outcomes in alpha-1,2-cis glycosidic C-O bond-forming processes are unpredictable and dependent on the steric and electronic nature of protecting groups bound to carbohydrate coupling partners. Currently, the most reliable approaches rely on the use of a chiral auxiliary or hydrogen-bond directing group at the C2- and C4-position of carbohydrate electrophiles to control alpha-1,2-cis selectivity. In our approach, earthabundant copper not only acts as a photocatalyst and a bond-forming catalyst, but also enforces the stereocontrolled formation of anomeric C-O bonds. This cross-coupling protocol enables highly diastereoselective access to a wide variety of alpha-1,2-cis-glycosides and biologically relevant alpha-glycan oligosaccharides. Our work provides a foundation for developing new methods for the stereoselective construction of natural and unnatural anomeric carbon(sp(3))-heteroatom bonds.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900005	34168901

However, reaching a predictive ability in this direction is extremely challenging. It requires both the ability to predict quantitatively the activation barriers in cases where the structure and sequence are known and the ability to predict the effect of different mutations. In this work, we propose a protocol for predicting reasonable starting structures of mutants of proteins with known structures and for calculating the activation barriers of the generated mutants. Our approach also allows us to use the predicted structures of the generated mutant to predict structures and activation barriers for subsequent set of mutations. This protocol is used to examine the reliability of the in silico directed evolution of Kemp eliminase and haloalkane dehalogenase. We also used the results of single and double mutations as a base for predicting the effect of transition-state stabilization by multiple concurrent mutations. This strategy seems to be useful in creating an activity funnel that provides a qualitative ranking of the catalytic power of different mutants.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900006	34178420

Herein, we report the direct allylic C(sp(3))-H thiolation mediated by visible light photoredox catalysis. The use of in situ-generated thiyl radical from disulfide as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent and a coupling partner enabled selective cleavage of the allylic C(sp(3))-H bond followed by C(sp(3))-S bond formation. The undesired hydrothiolation, a prevalent reaction from facile thiyl radical addition to olefins, was prevented by the immediate deprotonation of thiol under basic conditions. A wide range of diaryl disulfides and olefins participated in the reaction, producing allyl thioethers with high efficiency. Mechanistic investigations revealed the participation of the photocatalyst as a redox mediator, which was crucial for the transformation of the allyl radical into the allyl cation and further ionic coupling process. Based on the proposed mechanism, a limitation in the synthesis of alkyl allyl sulfide was solved with a rationally designed more reducible unsymmetrical disulfide, which makes the desired catalytic cycle operative.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900007

This work reports a method for the selective functionalization of anilines using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent to promote an acid-catalyzed hydroarylation of olefins. Mechanistic experiments revealed that HFIP both protonates the alkene and selectively enables anilines toward the electrophilic aromatic substitution. This powerful strategy has been applied to the functionalization of the anti-inflammatory mefenamic acid with chemocontrol and regiocontrol.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900008

It is generally accepted now that also in heterogeneous catalytic systems, the reaction is catalyzed by molecular, dissolved Pd(0) complexes. In recent time, the mechanism of leaching and, in particular, the dynamics of dissolution and redeposition of metal species came into the focus of research reports. In this context, the specific approach of this study is the comparison of different solid palladium precatalysts regarding their activity in the Heck reaction and the corresponding relation to the dissolution process of palladium in particular with demanding substrates. The potential correlation of leaching and reaction kinetics has been studied for bromobenzene and chlorobenzene. The contemporaneous determination of the conversion and concentration of palladium in solution and separate temperature-programmed Pd dissolution experiments revealed differing leaching mechanisms comparing supported palladium oxide catalysts with isolated palladium surface complexes.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900009

To gain a fundamental understanding of the Ru promotion effects, we herein performed an in situ spectroscopic study by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)-Auger of working Co/TiO2 catalysts (ca. 12 wt % Co, pure anatase TiO2 phase) promoted with different amounts of Ru (0.1-1.2 wt %). At typical FTS conditions (220 degrees C, 20 bar, H-2/CO = 2), the activity in terms of both metal-time-yield (MTY) and initial turnover frequency (TOF) was maximized for the catalysts promoted with 0.1-0.2 wt % Ru, for which most of the Ru was alloyed with Co in bimetallic nanoparticles. The analysis of Auger electrons evidenced that the lower (apparent) TOF of accessible CoO sites in the absence of Ru and at Ru concentrations beyond 0.2 wt % is bridged to the development, under reaction conditions, of FTS-inactive cobalt carbide (CoCx) and cobalt oxide (CoOx) patches, respectively, at the outermost surface of cobalt crystallites.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900010

The present study demonstrates that a high glycerol conversion (40.9%) and significant dihydroxyacetone (DHA) selectivity (65.1%) can be obtained at 303 K under 1 atm air in a base-free solution during the oxidation of glycerol over a bimetallic catalyst supported on SBA-15 (Pt-Bi/SBA-15). CO chemisorption data and transmission electron microscopy characterization show that Bi was deposited on both the step and terrace sites of the Pt surface and consequently modified the catalytic activity. Kinetic studies revealed that the addition of Bi significantly altered the reaction route such that DHA was produced rather than glyceraldehyde (GLD) during the initial stage of the process. C-13 NMR analysis found that glycerol tended to chelate with Bi atoms via hydroxyl groups (-OH) to modify the stereochemistry of the reactants. Density functional theory calculation confirmed that each of the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol were captured by the bismuth species, and the middle -OH simultaneously interacted with the platinum surface resulting in selective oxidation of glycerol to DHA. Bismuth ions (Bi3+) were also determined to promote the isomerization of GLD to DHA, which improved the DHA selectivity. These experimental and theoretical results together explain the high activity of the Pt-Bi/SBA-15 under moderate conditions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900012

Perhaps the largest hurdle has been gaining experimental insight into the active site of the electrocatalyst used to facilitate this chemistry. Decades of study have clarified that a range of transition-metal oxides have particularly high catalytic activity for the OER. Unfortunately, for virtually all of these materials, metal oxidation and the OER occur at similar potentials. As a result, catalyst surface topography and electronic structure are expected to continuously evolve under reactive conditions. Gaining experimental insight into the OER mechanism on such materials thus requires a tool that allows spatially resolved characterization of the OER activity. In this study, we overcome this formidable experimental challenge using second harmonic microscopy and electrochemical methods to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of OER activity on polycrystalline Au working electrodes. At moderately anodic potentials, we find that the OER activity of the electrode is dominated by <1% of the surface area and that there are two types of active sites. The first is observed at potentials positive of the OER onset and is stable under potential cycling (and thus presumably extends multiple layers into the bulk gold electrode). The second occurs at potentials negative of the OER onset and is removed by potential cycling (suggesting that it involves a structural motif only 1-2 Au layers deep). This type of active site is most easily understood as the catalytically active species (hydrous oxide) in the so-called incipient hydrous oxide/adatom mediator model of electrocatalysis. Combining the ability we demonstrate here to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of OER activity with a systematic program of electrode surface structural modification offers the possibility of creating a generation of OER electrocatalysts with unusually high activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900013	32551180

We report that single Au atoms on Co3O4 (Au-1/Co3O4 single-atom catalysts (SAC)) exhibit excellent activity and stability for CO oxidation and that the activity origin of Au-1/Co3O4 SAC is an active area centered by Au-1 atom with one nearby Co and O atoms (and/or O vacancy). The turnover frequency is 3.1 s-1 at -75 degrees C, to our knowledge, which makes Au-1/Co3O4 SAC one of the most active Au catalysts for CO oxidation. The activity can be maintained after 10 cycles of temperature-programmed reaction from -100 to 300 degrees C or storage in air for 1 year, indicating the high stability of Au-1/Co3O4 SAC. The isotope, in situ DRIFTS, kinetics, and density functional theory (DFT) results further demonstrate that CO2 is produced through two reaction pathways, following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (predominant) and Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms, respectively. The present findings pave the way for better understanding supported metal catalysts.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900014

We have furnished over 30 examples of aminosilane synthesis along with kinetic studies using MeBnNH and MePhSiH2 as coupling partners. The kinetic studies suggest a reversible reaction with silane which generates aminosilane and an Fe-hydride dimer that undergoes rate-limiting protonolysis with amine with N-H bond cleavage in the transition state, consistent with a primary KIE of 2.42(3). The presence of dimers as on-cycle intermediates was analyzed in depth. Beyond this we have explored the substrate scope of phosphinosilane formation which shows a preferential heterodehydrocoupling to give the phosphinosilane with primary and secondary silanes.

Here, we investigated the kinetics of water formation (from hydrogen and chemisorbed oxygen) in the confined space at the interface between bilayer (BL) silica and a Ru(0001) support, compared to the reaction on the bare Ru(0001) surface. Ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) experiments were carried out at different temperatures at elevated pressures of H-2 to follow the reaction kinetics. The apparent activation energy at the BL-silica/Ru(0001) interface was found to be 0.38 eV lower than that on bare Ru(0001), consistent with a recent report by Prieto et al. (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2018, 57(28), 8749-8753) carried out at lower H-2 pressures using low-energy electron microscopy. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the rate-limiting step in the direct hydrogenation pathway on the Ru(0001) surface is the first hydrogen addition step (*H + *O <-> *OH). The confinement at the BL-silica/Ru(0001) interface only marginally affects the energy barrier of the first hydrogen addition. Instead, it activates an alternative disproportionation reaction pathway (*H2O + *O <-> 2*OH). On the bare Ru(0001) surface, the disproportionation pathway can only occur at cryogenic temperatures or under high water vapor pressures. However, the presence of the BL-silica increases the desorption barrier for water molecules at the interface. The increased residence time allows trapped water molecules to react with chemisorbed oxygen to produce two *OH per H2O with an activation energy 0.25 eV lower than that of the first hydrogen addition step. This work reveals the origin of the observed accelerated water formation reaction at the BL-silica/Ru(0001) interface in the low-temperature regime (T < 350 K) and points to a route to engineer chemical reaction pathways by leveraging subnanoscale confined spaces at metal-oxide interfaces.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900017

This study presents a cutting-edge strategy combining density functional theory (DFT), catalytic tests complemented with the extensive characterization of a wide range of metal catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Ag, Ir, and Pt), and statistical tools for a computer-assisted investigation of this reaction. The steady-state catalytic tests identified four classes of materials comprising (i) poorly active (<8%) Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, Cu/SiO2, and Ag/SiO2; (ii) Rh/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2, which exhibit intermediate CH3Br selectivity (<60%); (iii) Ir/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2, which display great propensity to CH4 (>50%); and (iv) Ru/SiO2, which exhibits the highest selectivity to CH3Br (up to 96%). In-depth characterization of representative catalysts in fresh and used forms was done by X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, N-2 sorption, temperature-programmed reduction, Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The dimensionality reduction performed on the 272 DFT intermediate adsorption energies using principal component analysis identified two descriptors that, when employed together with the experimental data in a random forest regressor, enabled the understanding of activity and selectivity trends by connecting them to the energy intervals of the descriptors. In addition, a representative analytic model was found using the Bayesian inference. These findings illustrate the exciting opportunities presented by integrated experimental/computational screening and set the fundamental basis for the accelerated discovery of superior hydrodebromination catalysts and beyond.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900018

Oxidative pretreatment at 150 degrees C "collapsed" the clusters' ligand shell, oxidizing the hydrocarbon backbone, but the S remaining on Au acted as poison. Oxidation at 250 degrees C produced bare Au surfaces by removing S which migrated to the support (forming Au+-S), leading to highest activity. During reaction, structural changes occurred via COinduced Au and O-induced S migration to the support. The results reveal the dynamics of nanocluster catalysts and the underlying cluster chemistry.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900019	32551181

Herein, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Boltzmann statistics to describe ensembles of nanoparticles obtaining different morphologies under reaction conditions (temperature and gas-phase chemical potential) and their respective distribution of active sites. We apply our methodology on Rh catalytic nanoparticles, and we address the contribution of metastable nanostructures on the overall CO dissociation catalytic activity. Importantly, we demonstrate how catalytic trends can change when accounting for an ensemble of nanoparticles compared to a single, thermodynamically stable nanoparticle. Thus, our work enlightens the impact of statistical representation of catalyst morphology on modeling structure-sensitive reactions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900020

The electrodes were prepared by magnetron sputtering (MS) in an oblique angle configuration and under various conditions aimed at preparing metallic, oxide, or oxyhydroxide films. Their electrochemical analysis has been complemented with a thorough physicochemical characterization to determine the effect of microstructure, chemical state, bilayer structure, and film thickness on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The maximum electrocatalytic activity was found for the metallic electrode, where analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrated that the active catalytic phase at the surface after its electrochemical conditioning is a kind of oxidized nickel oxide/hydroxide layer with the thickness of a few nanometers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis of these steady-state working electrodes supports that the enhanced performance of the metallic nickel anode vs other chemical states resides in the easier electron transfer through the electrode films and the various interlayers built up during their fabrication and activation. The long-term steady-state operation of the anodes and their efficiency for water splitting was proved in a full-cell AEMWE setup incorporating magnetron-sputtered metallic nickel as the cathode. This work proves that MS is a suitable technique to prepare active, stable, and low-cost electrodes for AEMWE and the capacity of this technique to control the chemical state of the electrocatalytically active layers involved in the OER.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900021

Pyridoxal-Catalyzed Racemization of alpha-Aminoketones Enables the Stereodivergent Synthesis of 1,2-Amino Alcohols Using Ketoreductases								ACS CATALYSIS				10	11			6171	6175		10.1021/acscatal.0c01502				JUN 5 2020	2020	Differentially substituted 1,2-amino alcohols are a prevalent motif in a variety of pharmaceutical and agrochemical molecules. Dynamic kinetic resolutions (DKRs) that involve the asymmetric reduction of alpha-amino ketones are attractive for preparing this motif; however, methods for racemizing the stereogenic alpha-carbon under mild conditions are underdeveloped. Here we report a chemoenzymatic DKR involving ketoreductases (KREDs), in which pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) is used to catalyze racemization of the starting racemic alpha-aminoketone. This strategy enables access to a variety of 1,2-amino alcohols with high levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Using commercially available KREDs, all four possible stereoisomers can be accessed, highlighting a benefit to this approach.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900022

In this study, four types of MnO2 catalysts with crystal phases corresponding to alpha-, beta-,gamma-, and delta-MnO2 were synthesized, and their catalytic properties in HCHO and C6H6 oxidation were studied. alpha- and gamma-MnO2 were found to possess much better activity for C6H6 oxidation than delta- and beta-MnO2 catalysts, whereas delta-MnO2 exhibited the best performance for HCHO oxidation as compared with other types of MnO2. Three kinds of oxygen species were discriminated based on their Mn-O bond strength and reducibility. By quantitatively correlating the amount of specific oxygen species with the reaction rates, the catalytic roles of different oxygen species in HCHO and C6H6 oxidation were clarified. With the assistance of isotopic labeling studies, the participation of oxygen species in C6H6 oxidation-which followed a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism-was illuminated.									29	1	0	0	5	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900023

OXA-48 enzymes are clinically important class D serine beta-lactamases (SBLs) that confer resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems. However, OXA-48 and related enzymes vary widely in their activity toward different substrates: OXA-48 primarily hydrolyzes carbapenems, whereas the OXA-163 variant is a cephalosporinase with minimal carbapenemase activity. The basis of cephalosporinase activity in OXA-163 remains elusive. Here we use QM/MM reaction simulations (umbrella sampling molecular dynamics) to study the breakdown of the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftazidime, a key antibiotic for healthcare-associated infections, by selected OXA-48 variants. Calculated free energy barriers for ceftazidime deacylation correctly capture the differing catalytic efficiencies of the studied enzymes and identify the catalytically competent orientation for bound ceftazidime. Additionally, we show that high flexibility of the Omega loop bordering the active site, a determinant of specificity in many SBLs, is not required for efficient deacylation. Based on our simulations, cephalosporin breakdown in OXA-163 is efficient due to subtle control of active site solvation, which requires a particular orientation of Leu158 in the Omega loop. Our simulations further predict that a single mutation in the OXA-48 beta 5-beta 6 loop (Arg214Ser) will increase the efficiency of ceftazidime deacylation to that of OXA-163. The finding that the hydration of the general base in the active site determines deacylation efficiency is possibly important in other class D beta-lactamases.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900024

In this work, the Cu&Zn dual-metal-modified SSZ-13 zeolite catalyst (Cu&Zn-SSZ-13) was elegantly synthesized in a one-pot (OP) manner, and the prepared material exhibits good NH3-SCR activity. Impressively, Cu&Zn-SSZ-13(OP) has greater hydrothermal stability than Cu-SSZ-13 catalysts prepared by other means. The characterization data (obtained by XPS, H-2-TPR, NH3-TPD and EPR techniques) in this work revealed that the Zn introduced by a one-pot method would not only help optimize and disperse the isolated Cu2+ species, providing good SCR activity, but also form [Zn-OH]-Z, [Cu-O-Zn]-Z, and [Zn-O-Zn]-Z complexes. Further DFT calculations confirm that these complexes are much more stable than single Cu ions under hydrothermal aging, and these Zn-containing species can function as anchors to stabilize the SSZ-13 framework.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900025

Activation energy barriers and elementary reaction rates have been calculated as a function of the hydrogen surface coverage, theta(H), with relevant properties derived from ab initio thermodynamics and kinetic rate estimates. The hydrogen coverage has a very strong effect on the adsorption energy and the second hydrogenation step of ethylene. A relatively low energy barrier favors the dissociation of H-2 on delta-MoC(001) leading to medium H coverages (>0.4 of a monolayer) where the energy barrier for the full hydrogenation of ethylene is already below the corresponding barriers seen on Pt(111) and Pd(111). At a high H coverage of similar to 0.85 of a monolayer, the C2H4 adsorbs at 1 atm and 300 K over a system having as-formed CH3 moiety species, which critically favors the C2H4 second hydrogenation, typically a rate limiting step, by reducing its activation energy to a negligible value of 0.08 eV, significantly lower than the equivalent values of similar to 0.5 eV reported for Pt(111) and Pd(111) catalyst surfaces. The ethane desorption rate is larger than the surface intermediate elementary reaction rates, pointing to its desorption upon formation, closing the catalytic cycle. The present results put delta-MoC under the spotlight as an economic and improved replacement catalyst for Pt and Pd, with significant improvements in enthalpy and activation energy barriers. Here, we provide a detailed study for the C2H4 hydrogenation reaction mechanism over a carbide showing characteristics or features not seen on metal catalysts. These can be exploited when dealing with technical or industrial applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900026

During the reduction process, the NiCo alloy particles undergo elemental segregation with Co migrating toward the center of the catalyst particles and Ni migrating to the outer surfaces. Under DMR conditions, the segregated structure is maintained, thus hinting at the importance of this structure to optimal catalytic functions. Finally, the formation of Ni-rich branches on the surface of the particles is observed during DMR, suggesting that the loss of Ni from the outer shell may play a role in the reduced stability and hence catalyst deactivation. These findings provide insights into the morphological and electronic structural changes that occur in a NiCo-based catalyst during DMR. Further, this study emphasizes the need to study catalysts under operating conditions in order to elucidate material dynamics during the reaction.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900027	32551182

Traditional methods of catalyst preparation such as impregnation or precipitation lead to the formation of relatively large metal nanoparticles (15-30 nm). The design of supported metal catalysts with higher dispersion is expected to result in major rate enhancement in many catalytic reactions. Hereby, we propose an efficient way to significantly increase the dispersion of metal catalysts by disassembling of supported metal nanoparticles using in situ polycondensation of aldehydes produced during dehydrogenation of fatty alcohols. Bulky polymers behave as surfactants, facilitating budding of smaller metal nanoparticles. Subsequent removal of carbon species by oxidative treatments results in smaller isolated metal nanoparticles with the sizes of about 2-7 nm and 3-6 times higher catalytic activity in hydrogenation, amination, and oxidation reactions. This method opens up the possibility of metal redispersion in both freshly prepared and deactivated catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900028

This combined computational and experimental study demonstrates that diarylcarbenes display reactivity characteristics that are more reminiscent of donor/acceptor carbenes. When the reactions are carried out with the chiral dirhodium catalysts Rh-2(S-PTAD)(4) and Rh-2(S-NTTL)(4), highly enantioselective and diastereoselective cyclopropanations can be achieved, forming 1,1,2-triarylcyclopropanes. The reason for this behavior is because the two rings are unable to align in the plane of the rhodium carbene at the same time. The aryl ring aligned in the plane of the carbene behaves as a donor group, whereas the aryl ring aligned orthogonally behaves as an acceptor group.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900029

For the Ni-only phase, water adsorption and intercalation can significantly lower both the surface and interface energies, and even introduce "negative surface energy". Thus, water can exfoliate layers, leading to Fe ion adsorption on inner layers, as demonstrated by ab initio molecular dynamics. These single atoms have been carefully speciated (i.e., initially prepared as Fe2+ and Fe3+) and proton coupled electron transfer between the H2O-Fe and lattice oxygen ions has been observed in all ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which is attributed to the Fe incorporation, since no proton coupled electron transfer occurs under free water conditions. Furthermore, 15 possible oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms near Fe ions show that the main active species corresponds to the Ni2+, which is reduced from Ni3+ via H transfer when a Fe2+ iron adsorbs nearby, and the overpotential can be significantly reduced to 0.23 V.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900031

Regarding semiconductor-based photocatalysts, cadmium sulfide (CdS) materials have received extensive consideration for various photoredox reactions because of their suitable band gap (about 2.4 eV) for visible light response and well-matched band edge stations. In this paper, we begin with a concise discussion of the basic physical properties of CdS materials, including electronic band structures, optical properties, crystallographic structures, and phase transition. Then, the fundamental principles of photocatalytic organic transformations over CdS and the effect of different active species on the selective photoredox process are concisely summarized. In particular, we will highlight the photocatalytic selective organic synthesis application over various CdS-based photocatalysts, including selective reductions, oxidations, and valorization of lignin. Finally, the future perspectives and challenges in the development of efficient CdS-based photocatalytic system toward selective organic synthesis are discussed. It is anticipated that this timely overview of recent advances in selective organic synthesis over CdS-based materials would inspire the rational design of CdS or other semiconductor-based catalysts with ameliorated performances toward a variety of artificial photoredox-catalyzed selective organic transformations to value-added feedstocks and beyond.									43	0	0	0	1	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900032

In PEMFCs, small particle sizes of the Pt catalyst are required to increase Pt utilization, which lower costs and also increase Pt dispersion, which itself minimizes O-2 mass transport losses. Reducing the particle size improves both the utilization and dispersion; however, stability of small particle sizes is an issue. Pt dissolution, as one of the major degradation mechanisms of PEMFC catalyst layers, is predicted to depend on the particle size. The particle size cannot be independently varied from loading in commercial Pt/C materials that have been used in numerous studies employing accelerated stability tests (ASTs). Therefore, in the study presented here, the Pt particle diameter was varied from 2 to 10 nm by depositing mass-selected nanoparticles on a flat glassy carbon substrate using magnetron sputtering. This allows exclusive control over particle density (interparticle distance) and particle size, which becomes difficult even with advanced synthetic techniques for applied Pt/C materials. Additionally, effects of the 3D porous support are eliminated. These model systems were subjected to an aggressive AST in order to cause significant Pt dissolution, which was monitored online using the scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The results uncover a previously overlooked phenomenon: two competing trends in dissolution from (1) particle passivation caused by particle sizedependent shifts on oxophilicity and (2) electrochemically active surface area. Therefore, crucial impacts of the particle size on degradation may be overlooked in a variety of electrochemical studies, which compare catalytic materials. Finally, suggestions are given for improved ASTs for dissolution, which provide insights into the intrinsic stability of Pt nanoparticles toward dissolution.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900033

One of the major reasons for drug resistance is the expression of beta-lactamases especially metallo-beta-lactamases such as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) by Gram-negative bacteria. The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) was found to be a promising inhibitor of NDM-1 to potentiate currently used beta-lactam antibiotics to overcome drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Although several chemical synthesis and chemoenzymatic synthesis approaches to access AMA have been reported, the biosynthesis of AMA was still elusive. Herein, we identified the key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of AMA in Aspergillus oryzae. AMA synthase is a PLP-dependent cysteine synthase homologous protein which utilizes O-acetyl-L-serine/Ophospho-L-serine and L-aspartic acid as its substrates. Remarkably, this enzyme catalyzes two consecutive C-N bond formations to produce AMA efficiently which may be attributed to the spacious substrate-binding pocket. PLP is covalently bound to Lys61 by an internal aldimine from the PLP re face, and the si face of PLP pyridine ring is accessible to the substrates to promote the nucleophilic addition of amino acids to the double bond of the external adiminine and ultimately to generate chiral C-alpha with S configuration. The catalytic mechanism was proposed based on molecular docking and biochemical experiments. In addition, we have further investigated the substrate scope of AMA synthase and identified a variant enzyme which shows promising potential in producing structurally diverse molecules containing the C-N bond.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900034

Here we report that manganese oxide nanorod-supported single-site Ru catalysts are active, selective, and stable for oxidative cyanation of various alcohols to give the corresponding nitriles with molecular oxygen and ammonia as the reactants. The very low amount of Ru (0.1 wt %) with atomic dispersion boosts the catalytic performance of manganese oxides. Experimental and theoretical results show how the Ru sites enhance the ammonia resistance of the catalyst, bolstering its performance in alcohol dehydrogenation and oxygen activation, the key steps in the oxidative cyanation. This investigation demonstrates the high efficiency of a single-site Ru catalyst for nitrile production.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900035

Mechanistic experiments, kinetic studies, and surface-spectroscopic methods revealed supported rhodium(0) nanoparticles (NP) as the active catalytic species. Further studies suggest that CAAC-derived modifiers play a key role in determining the chemoselectivity of the hydrogenation of fluorinated arenes, thus offering an avenue for further tuning of the catalytic properties.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900036	32551183

In this work, we prepared a model MgO-SiO2 catalyst by impregnation of MgO onto an SBA-15 support and used this material to study the reaction kinetics of ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde. The rates of acetaldehyde and ethylene production were measured for ethanol partial pressures ranging from 0.92 to 5.25 kPa. Both rates are fractional order at 723 K, decreasing to nearly zero-order at 648 K. Consistent with the literature for MgO-SiO2 Lebedev catalysts, both basic sites and Lewis acidic sites were observed on this catalyst. The rates of both acetaldehyde and ethylene were inhibited by pyridine but not by 2,6-ditertbutylpyridine, suggesting that both reactions involve not only basic but also Lewis acidic sites. To elucidate the origin of this cooperativity, a microkinetic model was constructed using a recently published mechanism for the Lebedev reaction catalyzed by MgO. The model was fit to our data using four fitting parameters. The fitting suggests that adsorbed ethanol and hydrogen atoms have a weaker bond with mixed-oxide MgO-SiO2 catalysts than with bulk MgO catalysts, which we attribute experimentally to an increase in the number of moderate-strength Mg2+O2- site pairs formed at the expense of strongly basic MgO sites.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900037

Density functional calculations have been carried out to explore the reaction mechanism and the origin of selectivity. The porphyrin ligand was found to be redox noninnocent and accept two electrons and one proton, while the ferrous ion keeps its oxidation state as +2 during the reduction. The Fe-II-porphyrin diradical intermediate then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2, coupled with two electron transfers from the porphyrin ligand to the CO2 moiety. Subsequently, an intramolecular proton transfer takes place from the porphyrin nitrogen to the carboxylate oxygen, affording an Fe-II-COOH intermediate. An alternative pathway to form the critical Fe-II-COOH intermediate, involving the attack on CO2 by an unprotonated two-electron reduced Fe-II-porphyrin diradical species followed by protonation, was found to be possible as well. Finally, proton transfer from the carbonic acid in the aqueous solution to the hydroxyl moiety results in the cleavage of the C-O bond and the production of a CO molecule. The formation of an Fe-II-hydride species, a critical intermediate for the production of H-2 and formic acid, was found to be kinetically much less favorable than the protonation of the porphyrin nitrogen, even though it is thermodynamically more favorable. The prevention of this metal-hydride formation pathway explains why this catalyst is highly selective for the reduction of CO2 in aqueous solution.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900038

We here propose a method that is able to automatically generate a catalytic reaction network and identify the preferred reaction pathway with determined uncertainty. Taking syngas conversion to ethanol on Rh(111) as an example, a reaction network consisting of 95 elementary steps was generated. Using energies calculated with an ensemble of 2000 functionals, the occurrence frequency of different ethanol formation pathways was obtained through pruning of the reaction network with mean-field microkinetic modeling. We found that CHCO is the most important reaction intermediate for ethanol formation with the highest confidence, even at varied temperatures and pressures. The transition state of CH3CH2O hydrogenation, i.e. CH3CH2O-H, possesses the highest possibility to be rate-controlling. CO has the highest possibility to be the surface dominant species at all the temperatures and pressures considered. The method developed in the current work substantially reduces the complexity of identifying the mechanism of catalytic reactions and shows great potential in expediting future catalyst design.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900039

However, the development of robust heterogeneous catalysts with high activity and stability has been a challenge. We herein report a synthesis of hollow nanostructured composite consisting of PdAg nanoparticles (NPs) and aminopolymers, poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), confined in hollow mesoporous organosilica spheres (HMOSs), which act as an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 to formate. The catalyst exhibits high formate yield with a turnover number (TON) of over 2700 and 13 700 for 22 and 110 h, respectively, under mild reaction conditions (total 2.0 MPa, 100 degrees C), which outperforms the conventional supported Pd catalysts because of the cooperative action of PEI and PdAg NPs confined in a nanospace to directly capture, activate, and hydrogenate the CO2 molecule. The catalyst is reusable over multiple cycles with high activity because of the protective effect and alkali-tolerant property of HMOSs. This study offers a strategy for the design and development of an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 conversion.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900040

Nevertheless, there are many short-comings, such as high photogenerated electron-hole recombination rate and poor light stability, that hinder the further development of artificial photosynthesis. Thus, inspired by the natural photosynthesis of green plants, a 3D spatial reticulation all-solid-state artificial direct Z-scheme photocatalyst is manufactured to solve the above problems by using a graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) shell encapsulating Cu2O nanowire arrays/Cu mesh (g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs/CM). Consequently, the CH3OH formation rate and the selectivity of g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs reached 22.6 ppm cm(-2) h(-1) and 94.9% under solar light irradiation, respectively. More importantly, the material retained 94.7% of its primary catalytic activity after 60 h test (ten reaction cycles). It is attributed to the protective g-C3N4 layer and the synergetic effect between interface carrier separation modulation and relatively short radial transmission channel design. This strategy provides unique insights into the design and preparation of efficient practical photocatalysts for energy synthesis.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900041

Currently, they belong to the state of the art catalysts owing to their environmental compatibility, high activity, propene selectivity, and durability. However, the structure-activity-selectivity relationships are still not appropriately understood. To close such gaps, we focused on elucidating the role of surface defects (coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zr-cus) sites) and supported Rh nanoparticles (NPs) in Rh/ZrO2 for activity and selectivity in the PDH reaction. Relevant physicochemical properties were analyzed by complementary experimental techniques, while details of catalyst functioning on an elementary-step level were derived from density functional theory calculations. Two types of Zr-cus sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation were suggested to exist on the surface of ZrO2. Those located at Rh NPs reveal higher intrinsic activity owing to the positive effect of the metal on hydrogen desorption, which is the rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction over bare ZrO2. However, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 is increased, propene strongly adsorbs on Rh, resulting in blockage of sites for hydrogen recombination. Consequently, the accelerating effect of the metal is hindered. Moreover, the strong propene adsorption plays a negative role in propene selectivity due to favoring conversion of the adsorbed propene into coke. The most active Rh/ZrO2 catalyst revealed higher activity in comparison with the state of the art Ru/YZrOx and an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3. It was also durable over 60 PDH/regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 degrees C lasting 11 days in total.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900042

The FeK/SWNTs catalyst outperforms the FeK/MWNTs catalyst in selectivity during CO2 hydrogenation to olefins with the selectivities being 62.3% and 52.4%, respectively. Of particular interest is that the FeK/SWNTs catalyst is more selective toward heavy olefins (C-5+(=) selectivity, 39.8%), whereas the FeK/MWNTs catalyst is more selective to light olefins (C-2-C-4(=) selectivity, 30.7%). The FeK/SWNTs catalyst also affords much lower selectivities to undesired CO and CH4 in addition to higher productivity of hydrocarbons, thus resulting in an unprecedentedly high productivity of heavy olefins of 27.6 mu mol(CO2) g(Fe)(-1) s(-1). The more electron-enriched exterior of SWNTs with large curvature, higher abundance of Hagg carbide, and stronger interaction with light olefins may rationalize the superior catalytic behavior of the FeK/SWNTs catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation to heavy olefins. The FeK/SWNTs catalyst also exhibited a minor change in catalytic performance in a 120 h stability test, highlighting SWNTs as a promising catalyst support for producing value-added chemicals from greenhouse gas CO2.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900043

This approach relies on the perturbation of the ground-state electronic properties of terminal alkynes through the formation and photoexcitation of copper acetylide intermediates. This process takes place through cooperative copper and organic photoredox catalysis and can be carried out in a stereodivergent manner. Thus, a systematic multivariate HTE screening spotlighted that a switch in the stereochemical outcome can be provoked by choosing an appropriate combination of ligand and base. The developed methodology has been applied to the stereoselective coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals with (hetero)aromatic terminal alkynes. As an additional practicality, similar reaction conditions allowed for the use of aromatic amines as radical precursors in a cross dehydrogenative coupling for the direct vinylation of inactivated C-H bonds.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900044

Herein, we developed a universal salt-template strategy for the fabrication of atomically dispersed Fe atoms on ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets characterized by a dramatically high concentration of 13.5 wt %. The proposed Fe-N-C nanozymes with densely isolated FeN4 sites show high peroxidase-like activities and exhibit a specific activity of 25.33 U/mg, superior to Zn(Co)-N-C nanozymes. Both experiments and theoretical analysis revealed that FeN4 sites not only lead to the strong adsorption of H2O2 molecules but also weaken the bonding interaction between single Fe atom and two absorbed hydroxyl groups, lowering the energy barrier of the formation of hydroxyl radicals and therefore boosting their peroxidase-like activities. As expected, utilizing the peroxidase-like activity of Fe-N-C nanozymes, good sensitivity and selectivity for the intracellular H2O2 monitoring were realized. It offers a versatile approach for the construction of densely isolated M-N-C single-atom catalysts and achieves better understanding of single sites for the peroxidase-like catalytic mechanisms.									38	3	0	0	5	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900047

Quantum chemical methods, most commonly density functional theory, are today an important tool in this pursuit. This Perspective describes recent efforts in modeling asymmetric reactions in enzymes by means of the quantum chemical cluster approach. The methodology is described briefly and a number of illustrative case studies performed recently at our laboratory are presented. The reviewed enzymes are limonene epoxide hydrolase, soluble epoxide hydrolase, arylmalonate decarboxylase, phenolic acid decarboxylase, benzoylformate decarboxylase, secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, acyl transferase, and norcoclaurine synthase. The challenges encountered in each example are discussed, and the modeling lessons learned are highlighted.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900048

Selectivity for C-O cleavage is determined by the relative rates of S(N)2 demethylation versus S(N)1 demethoxylation, with the axial or equatorial disposition of the silyloxonium ion intermediate acting as an important contributing factor. Modulation of the electron-donor power of the supporting phosphine ligands enables a switch in selectivity from demethylation of equatorial methyl ethers to 2 degrees demethoxylation. Applications of these accessible catalysts to the selective demethoxylation of the 3 alpha-methoxy group of cholic acid derivatives is demonstrated, including a switch in observed selectivity controlled by 7 alpha-substitution. The resting state of the catalyst has been characterized for two phosphine derivatives, demonstrating that the observed switch in C-O cleavage selectivity likely results from electronic factors rather than from a major perturbation of the catalyst structure.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900049

In contrast to precious palladium, rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium catalysts that are limited to electronically activated styrenes and acrylates, we herein disclose cobalt-catalyzed electro-oxidative C-H allylations with nonactivated alkenes. Thus, allylated benzamides were obtained with high levels of chemoselectivity, positional selectivity, and regioselectivity in the biomass-derived solvent gamma-valerolactone. Detailed mechanistic studies provided strong support for a base-assisted internal electrophilic-type substitution mechanism for the key C-H activation step. The cobaltaelectro-catalysis overall achieved resource-economy by avoiding the use of stoichiometric chemical oxidants, with H-2 as the only byproduct.									18	1	0	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900050

The synthesis of higher aliphatic amines was successfully operated in a continuous-flow miniplant. Key to success was the development of an integrated catalyst recycling for the homogeneous Rhodium/SulfoXantphos catalyst. With 1-decene and diethylamine as substrates, an average yield of the linear amine of 61% over 60 h of stable process operation was achieved. The catalyst recycling has been accomplished by using a thermomorphic multiphase system (TMS) consisting of methanol and n-dodecane, which was rationally established in batch experiments with a methodical approach. This TMS ensured high catalytic activities and facilitated an efficient catalyst separation and recycling. Before application in a continuous process, catalyst recyclability was proven, showing high catalyst activity over six runs with turnover frequencies up to 2400 h(-1).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900051

Among them, complexes with phosphino-iPr substituents ((POCR)-P-iPr'NP)Ir (4b, 4e, and 4g) exhibit very high catalytic activity for transfer dehydrogenation (TD) of both cyclic and linear alkanes. In the prototypical TD reaction of cyclooctane (COA) with tertbutylethylene (TBE), for example, 4g affords 14 720 turnovers at 200 degrees C, which are more than twofold of that obtained by the most efficient catalyst reported so far. Moreover, these complexes are highly effective for acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, giving a turnover frequency of 8.8 min(-1) for H2- production within the first 4 h. The effects of the linkers at the positions ortho to the Ir center have been elucidated by a systematic comparison of electronic and steric properties of these O/ N- and S/N-linked pincer systems to those of C/C-linked (PCP)-P-iPr, O/O-linked (POCOP)-P-iPr, and S/O-linked (PSCOP)-P-iPr systems. Examination of the structure-activity relationships reveals that alkane C-H bond addition to the 14e (pincer)Ir fragment (the ratedetermining step in the TD reaction) is more favored by (POCR)-P-iPr'NP relative to other pincers, largely due to the strong N-linker -> C(aryl) pi-donation. Compared to the parent (POCOP)-P-iPr complex with similarly pi-donating O-linkers, the energy of the alkene-bound out-of-cycle resting state is raised by (POCR)-P-iPr'NP primarily due to steric factors. Consequently, the incorporation of the N-linker exerts an overall favorable effect on the catalytic rates. In addition, we found that the thermal stability of these catalysts with different linker combinations differs significantly.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900053

We synthesized a series of neutral and cationic indium complexes supported by tridentate Schiff base ligands and investigated their reactivities for the homo- and copolymerization of lactide or epsilon-caprolactone and methyl methacrylate. We showed that the neutral indium complex (+/-)-(NNiOtBu)In(CH2SiMe3)(2) (2) catalyzes the sequential block copolymerization of lactide/epsilon-caprolactone and methyl methacrylate without any additional reagents or synthetic steps. The block copolymers were stringently characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and fractional precipitation techniques.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900054

This self-sensitized approach simplifies systems and efficiencies; therefore, complete understanding of mechanistic principles is essential for improving catalysts. Here, we present a comprehensive study of dark reactions using electrochemical techniques to understand the multiple pathways for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO by an example self-sensitized photocatalyst: [Ir(bip)(ppy)(CH3CN)](2+) (bip = 2,6-bis(benzimidazole)pyridine, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile under anhydrous conditions reveals electrocatalysis by a two electron cycle at -1.7 V vs Fc(+/0) (denoted the cat-1 region) in which the metallocarboxylate formed by binding of Ir(I) to CO2 is cleaved by CO2 as the oxide acceptor. At -1.9 V (denoted the cat-2 region), the Ir(CO2) intermediate is reduced and catalysis is accelerated. In the presence of water, Ir(CO2) is protonated to Ir(CO2H), which is reduced at a potential less negative than -1.7 V, and then, the oxide acceptor is either CO2 to form HCO3- or protons to release H2O and the conjugate base of the acid source. Further reduction of Ir(CO2H) at cat-2 again accelerates catalysis. Rates vary widely in these various regimes with the minimum kobs of 0.3 s(-1) for anhydrous cat-1 to a maximum cat-2 rate of 2100 s(-1) with 1% water. Competitive deactivation pathways were discovered as Ir-Ir dimerization without reacting with CO2 or the formation of a hydride-bridged dinuclear complex during extended electrolysis at a high water concentration. The Ir-Ir dimer was characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry and Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).									3	0	0	0	0	1	3			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900055

This Review outlines the recent advances in the development of nitrogen-centered carbonylation reactions, which consists of two parts: nitrogen-center-directed carbonylation reactions and carbon-ylative C-N bonds activation. According to the reaction mechanisms, two-electron- and single-electron-mediated carbonylation reactions were systematically classified and discussed in detail. Different inert bonds such as C(sp(2))-H, C(sp(3))-H, C-C, C(sp(3))-N, and C(sp(2))-N bonds can be activated and ready for a carbonylative transformation toward the synthesis of the corresponding carbonyl-containing compounds.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900056

This work sheds light on the lattice oxygen recovery mechanism on CuO/CeO2 catalysts during CO-PROX reaction, which is critical to guarantee both good activity and selectivity, but that is yet to be well understood. Particularly, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice do not form in significant amounts until advanced reaction degrees, whereas pulse O-2 isotopic tests confirm the involvement of catalyst oxygen in the CO and H-2 oxidation processes occurring at all stages of the CO-PROX reaction (Mars-van Krevelen). Further mechanistic insights are provided by operando near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) experiments, which prove the gradual CuO reduction and steady oxidized state of Ce ions until the very surface reduction of CeO2 at the point of selectivity loss. Experiments are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal a more facile oxygen refill according to the trend CuO > CeO2 > Cu2O. Overall, this work concludes that the oxygen recovery mechanism in CO-PROX switches from a direct mechanism, wherein oxygen restores vacancy sites in the partially reduced CuO particles, to a synergistic mechanism with the participation of ceria once CuxO particles reach a critical reduction state. This mechanistic switch ultimately results in a decrease in CO conversion in favor of the undesired H-2 oxidation, which opens-up future research on potential strategies to improve oxygen recovery.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900057

To be viable, a thorough understanding of plasma-catalyst synergisms must be gained, specifically establishing links between the gas-phase, gas-surface interface, and resulting material properties. Optical emission spectroscopy provides insights into the impact of Pt and zeolite catalysts on plasma species densities, energetics, reaction kinetics, and plasma-catalyst configurations within N2O plasmas. The role of material structure on gas-phase chemistry is revealed through the use of Pt catalysts with two morphologies and size scaling. The concentration of excited-state NO substantially decreased at high powers with Pt nanopowder or microstructured zeolites. All catalytic materials significantly decreased N-2 vibrational temperatures, with little impact on rotational temperatures. Conversely, Pt materials had a limited effect on vibrational temperatures of NO; however, Pt powder enhanced NO decomposition within a two-stage system over the single-stage system. Material characterization revealed that the plasma effectively poisons Pt materials, resulting in poorer performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900058

Here, we report promising DNA-based catalysts comprised of G-quadruplex (G4) and Fe porphyrin for asymmetric olefin cyclopropanation. After the G4-based catalysts are optimized by several rounds of site mutation, their catalytic enantioselectivities achieve +81% and -86% enantiomeric excess (ee(trans)) at a turnover number (TON) as high as 500. The Fe porphyrin, binding upon the 5',3'-end G-quartet, constitutes the active center for olefin cyclopropanation via an iron porphyrin carbene intermediate.

It is shown that CA addition increases the thiophene HDS activity. This may be directly ascribed to the increase in NiWS site concentration detected by IR spectroscopy. HRTEM emphasizes that the addition of CA to NiW catalysts decreases the average size of the particles. This is confirmed by HR STEM-HAADF that even evidences the presence of nanoclusters on NiW catalysts prepared with CA. Hence, local and global analysis of the NiW samples are in good agreement to account for the increase of NiWS site concentration by CA addition. Then the contrast and interatomic distances were analyzed in the atomic-scale images obtained by HR STEM-HAADF. These measurements allow identification of the nature of the atoms in the core and edge of the sulfided particles. The metal atoms of particle core are only W ones, whereas the edges of the particles could be either fully promoted with detection of only Ni atoms or partially promoted with detection of both Ni and W atoms. Accordingly, IR spectroscopy evidenced edge sites with different promotion degrees.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900060

However, construction of the pharmacophore of beta(2)-adrenoreceptor agonists with this method remains a great challenge because of complete racemization of the benzylic alcohol during deprotection of the acetal groups. In this study, structure-guided redesign of a hydroxynitrile lyase originating from Prunus communis (PcHNL5) enables a highly enantioselective hydrocyanation of rigid benzo-ketal aldehyde which was proved to be resistant against racemization during the deprotection step, with dramatically improved productivity (>95% conversion vs <1%). X-ray structure analysis and kinetic study revealed the side chain of L331 tunes the substrate adaptability of bulky and rigid benzoketal aldehyde, thereby facilitating the formation of a series of valuable unnatural cyanohydrins in high enantiopurities and good yields. Furthermore, the HNL variant L331A was successfully applied for a gram-scale chemo-enzymatic synthesis of (R)-salmeterol, a long-term beta(2) -adrenoreceptor agonist, in an optically pure form (>99% ee) with an overall yield of 54%, which is the highest value reported.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500039

The success of gram-level preparation and synthetic transformations proves the potential of this catalytic strategy for practical applications.

High enantioselectivity has been achieved for substrates over a wide scope. With the same chiral catalyst, nitroso-4-fluorobenzenes in these reactions under DCM/THF/water/air led to oxidative nitroso-Povarov reactions also with high enantioselectivity.

The solution-phase X-ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst solutions and the FEFF fitting as well as the evaluation of the catalytic and stoichiometric reactions reveal the following observations: (i) the major intermediate in the catalytic cycle is a mononuclear divalent [Cu(OAc)(2)]center dot 2H(2)O species, (ii) coordination of the phen ligand to the Cu catalyst significantly inhibits the catalytic activity, (iii) 2 equiv of Cu(OAc)(2)center dot H2O oxidizes the zerovalent "Pd(phen)" species to divalent [Pd(OAc)(2) (phen)], and (iv) the divalent [Cu(OAc)(2)](2)center dot 2AcOH species is regenerated by the treatment of monovalent Cu(OAc) with AcOH in air.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500054

However, the structural diversity of these privileged substructures is currently limited by the need to manipulate highly toxic, highly reactive reagents and intermediates in their synthesis. In response to this longstanding challenge, we report an umpolung strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse di-tert-alkylphosphine building blocks via S(N)1 alkylation of in situ generated PH3 gas. We show that the products-which are isolated as air-stable, odorless phosphonium salts-can be used directly in the preparation of key synthetic intermediates and ligand classes. The di-tert-alkylphosphino building blocks that are accessible using our methodology therefore enable facile expansion of extant ligand classes by modification of a previously invariant vector; we demonstrate that these modifications affect the steric and electronic properties of the ligands and can be used to tune their performance in catalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500008

Three distinct classes of epoxides, styrene oxides, cyclic epoxides, and terminal aliphatic epoxides, all undergo coupling in moderate to good yield and high regioselectivity with the use of three different nitrogen-based ligands for Ni under otherwise identical reaction conditions. The mild reaction conditions accommodate a broad scope of abundant and complex coupling partners. Mechanistic studies suggest that when styrene oxides are employed radical intermediates are involved via Ti-radical ring-opening of the epoxide. Conversely, for terminal aliphatic epoxides, involvement of an iodohydrin intermediate enables the formation of the unexpected linear product.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500045	32747870

Mechanistic studies indicate that a radical chain mechanism operates, which proceeds via a phosphoranyl radical generated from a radical/ polar crossover process. Initiation of the radical chain was found to proceed via two opposing photocatalytic quenching mechanisms, offering complementary reactivity. The mild nature of the radical deoxygenation process enables the reduction of a wide range of functionalized sulfoxides, including those containing acid-sensitive groups, in typically high isolated yields.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500044	32582464

However, the detailed catalytic mechanism of coronavirus 3CL(Pro) remains largely unknown. We took an integrated approach of employing X-ray crystallography, mutational studies, enzyme kinetics study, and inhibitors to gain insights into the mechanism. Such experimental work is supplemented by computational studies, including the prereaction state analysis, the ab initio calculation of the critical catalytic step, and the molecular dynamic simulation of the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Taken together, such studies allowed us to identify a residue pair (Glu-His) and a conserved His as critical for binding; a conserved GSCGS motif as important for the start of catalysis, a partial negative charge cluster (PNCC) formed by Arg-Tyr-Asp as essential for catalysis, and a conserved water molecule mediating the remote interaction between PNCC and catalytic dyad. The data collected and our insights into the detailed mechanism have allowed us to achieve a good understanding of the difference in catalytic efficiency between 3CL(Pro) from SARS and MERS, conduct mutational studies to improve the catalytic activity by 8-fold, optimize existing inhibitors to improve the potency by 4-fold, and identify a potential allosteric site for inhibitor design. All such results reinforce each other to support the overall catalytic mechanism proposed herein.									20	0	0	0	10	1	21			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500051	32391184

However, conventional in situ click chemistry provides extremely low yields of the products, making it incompatible with direct activity-based assays. Here, to address this issue, we focused on the catalysis of azide-alkyne cycloaddition (AAC) by the metal ion in metalloproteins. We chose 2-ethynyl N-heterocompounds as alkyne fragments which are activated by coordination to the metal ion. For proof of concept, we applied metal ion-catalyzed in situ AAC to identify inhibitors of Fe(II)-dependent lysine demethylase 5C (KDM5C). The triazole product was obtained in dramatically high yield, dependently on Fe(II) in KDM5C, and the metalloprotein-catalyzed click reaction was compatible with activity-based high-throughput screening, enabling us to discover a potent KDM5C inhibitor. Thus, metal-catalyzed in situ AAC should be generally applicable to other metalloproteins.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500001

Directed evolution of a P450 variant, P411-C10, yielded a lineage of enzyme variants capable of forming chiral lactone derivatives with high catalytic efficiency (up to 4000 TTN) and in a stereodivergent manner. For carbene insertion into secondary C-H bonds, a single mutation was discovered to invert the two contiguous chiral centers and lead to the opposite enantiomers of the same major diastereomers. This work demonstrates the utility of engineered enzymes for asymmetric catalysis and highlights the remarkable tunability of these genetically encoded biocatalysts for accessing the desired selectivities.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500002

This transformation is more challenging than when using more strained epoxide comonomers and even more so when it is performed using metalfree routes. Herein, we report an organocatalytic oxetane/CO2 coupling procedure that enables the selection of cyclic carbonate or polymer from a common intermediate. Using a novel I-2-based binary catalyst system, cyclic carbonate with high selectivity (up to 94%) was obtained at 55 degrees C, whereas simply changing the temperature to 105 degrees C yielded the polycarbonate with M-n of up to 6.4 kDa, thus showing that either trimethylene carbonate or its concomitant polycarbonate product can be selected solely by the manipulation of the reaction conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500003

In this reaction, coproheme is converted to heme b via monovinyl monopropionate deuteroheme (MMD) in two consecutive decarboxylation steps. In Firmicutes decarboxylation of propionates 2 and 4 of coproheme depend on hydrogen peroxide and the presence of a catalytic tyrosine. Here we demonstrate that ChdCs from Actinobacteria are unique in using a histidine (H118 in ChdC from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, CdChdC) as a distal base in addition to the redox-active tyrosine (Y135). We present the X-ray crystal structures of coproheme-CdChdC and MMD-CdChdC, which clearly show (i) differences in the active site architecture between Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and (ii) rotation of the redox-active reaction intermediate (MMD) after formation of the vinyl group at position 2. Distal H118 is shown to catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide (k(app) = (4.90 +/- 1.25) X 10(4) M-1 s(-1)). The resulting Compound I is rapidly converted to a catalytically active Compound I* (oxoiron(IV) Y135(center dot)) that initiates the radical decarboxylation reactions. As a consequence of the more efficient Compound I formation, actinobacterial ChdCs exhibit a higher catalytic efficiency in comparison to representatives from Firmicutes. On the basis of the kinetic data of wild-type CdChdC and the variants H118A, Y135A, and H118A/Y135A together with high-resolution crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations, we present a molecular mechanism for the hydrogen peroxide dependent conversion of coproheme via MMD to heme b and discuss differences between ChdCs from Actinobacteria and Firmicutes.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500004	32440366

However, this type of reaction has so far been limited to activated allenes bearing an electron-withdrawing group. On the other hand, cleavage of an amide C-N bond to forge other chemical bonds has been widely reported but restricted to low atom economy due to the waste of the amine moiety of amides. We initiated a project of metal-catalyzed amino-acylation of allenes via cleavage of amide C-N bonds. Surprisingly, an amino-acylation of weakly activated aryl allenes was discovered via Lewis base catalysis, providing 2-methyl-3-aroylindole products, "privileged structures" in drug discovery. This is a unique example of Lewis base catalysis of weakly activated allenes, which was not reported yet. Extensive experimental and computational studies have been conducted to provide insight into the reaction mechanism. The nucleophilic addition of Lewis base catalyst to aryl allene is the rate-limiting step. A challenging [1,3]-proton transfer is realized by nitrogen anion intermediate assisted sequential [1,4]- and [1,6]-proton transfer in the reaction pathway.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500005

The effect of a preparative route on N2O decomposition activity has been examined for a PrBaCoO3 perovskite catalyst. Initially, citric acid preparation was utilized, where the A site ratio was altered in order to increase phase purity. Comparable compositions were then prepared by an oxalic acid precipitation method and by a supercritical antisolvent (SAS) technique to produce perovskites with a higher surface area (>30 m(2) g(-1)). By altering the A site ratio, it was possible to reduce the temperature required to produce a pure phase perovskite while maintaining a higher surface area. The use of the different preparation methods resulted in perovskites with varying properties, as determined by N-2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), oxygen temperature-programmed desorption, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). This work confirms the importance of lattice oxygen species that have high oxygen mobility for enhanced decomposition of N2O, as oxygen recombination is considered the rate-limiting step. Here, the formation of molecular oxygen is limited by surface- adsorbed O species being within a distance at which oxygen recombination is possible. The most active PrBaCo-based catalyst did not have the highest percentage of lattice oxygen as shown by XPS; however, the catalytic activity could be correlated to the mobile oxygen species and high surface area. The PrBaCo-based catalyst prepared by SAS converted 50% of the N2O present in the feed (T-50) at 410 degrees C, which represents a significant improvement over reported catalytic performance measured under similar conditions.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500006

The highly electron-donating nature of these abnormal N-heterocyclic carbenes (aNHCs) embedded in the carbene-phenolate chelating ligand scaffold resulted in good catalytic activity, generating linear polyethylene with a high molecular weight (M-n = 237 000). aImPy-Pd complexes efficiently catalyzed propylene polymerization to afford polypropylene free of regio defects. These catalytic systems exhibit good tolerance of various polar monomers and afford the desired copolymers. Up to 3.0% of the polar monomers were incorporated into the main chain, as determined by H-1 and C-13 NMR analysis. Furthermore, methyl methacrylate (MMA), as a 1,1-disubstituted ethylene derivative, was successfully incorporated into the main chain of polyethylene. Computational studies indicated that ethylene insertion into a Pd-alkyl bond by aImPy-Pd catalyst 6a is faster than that by the Pd catalyst bearing normal NHC analogues, which could be attributed to the high linearity and high molecular weight of polyethylene.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500007

Thiolate surfactants can greatly improve the overall yield; however, the dynamics of the reacting species and the reaction mechanism have remained unknown at the molecular scale. We elucidated the interaction of a series of aromatic compounds with octadecylthiolate-modified palladium nanocatalysts in atomic detail and explain large increases in product selectivity and yield through a detailed reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal adsorption free energies on the order of -5 kcal/mol on the ligand-modified nanoparticles, which are significantly smaller than those on bare metal surfaces, where -10 to -30 kcal/mol are found. The ligands induce a two-step process of condensation in the ligand shell and adsorption, leading to upright molecular orientations, in contrast to single-step adsorption on bare metal surfaces. Exothermic condensation into the ligand shell and binding to the metal surface are accompanied by large entropy losses due to the reduced mobility in the ligand shell and increased confinement of the alkyl chains. Results from molecular dynamics simulations using the interface force field (IFF) show impressive agreement with available thermochemical reference data from experiments. Upright orientations of aromatic alcohol reactants lower the activation energy for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction and suppress competing decarbonylation reactions. The analysis of the HDO reaction mechanism by QM/MM calculations in the presence of the ligands as well as by DFT calculations under vacuum uncovers the acidic and basic properties of hydrogenated Pd surfaces. The rate-limiting step involves the transfer of Pd-bound hydrogen atoms to hydroxyl groups in the alcohol reactants. The mechanism explains prior experimental data and supports the rational design of metal and alloy catalysts of specific shape, ligand coverage, and reaction conditions for biomass upgrading.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500009

However, direct deuteration at allylic C-H moieties is still a challenge. Few examples have been reported by transition-metal catalysis and no such reports have been documented in an organocatalytic fashion. Herein, a carbene-catalyzed C-H deuteration of enal at allylic C(sp(3)) and C(sp(2)) centers is disclosed. Addition of the carbene catalyst to the aldehyde moiety of enals to eventually activate the alpha- and gamma-carbon atom under oxidative conditions is critical to achieve high deuterium incorporation. Key mechanistic steps of our reaction include carbene catalyst addition, azolium ester formation, remote gamma-carbon activation, reversible alpha-and gamma-carbon enolization, and iterative H/D exchanges. The reaction is performed under mild conditions using D2O as the deuterium source to efficiently afford alpha,gamma-deuterated 2-alkenoic acids and their derivatives in good to excellent yields and high deuterium incorporation. These labeled products containing carbonyl and allyl bifunctionalities are valuable building blocks for further transformations, eventually leading to otherwise challenging labeled targets including deuterated allylic derivatives, aliphatic derivatives and polydeuterated drugs (e.g., Ibuprofen). The convenient and scalable synthesis has application potential for materials and pharmaceuticals.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500010

Herein, we demonstrate how Pd/NiO is able to direct the selectivity of furfural hydrogenation and maintain performance at low Pd loading by a unique dual-site mechanism. Sol-immobilization was used to prepare 1 wt % Pd nanoparticles supported on NiO and TiO2, with the Pd/NiO catalyst showing enhanced activity with a significantly different selectivity profile; Pd/NiO favors tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (72%), whereas Pd/TiO2 produces furfuryl alcohol as the major product (68%). Density functional theory studies evidenced significant differences on the adsorption of furfural on both NiO and Pd surfaces. On the basis of this observation we hypothesized that the role of Pd was to dissociate hydrogen, with the NiO surface adsorbing furfural. This dual-site hydrogenation mechanism was supported by comparing the performance of 0.1 wt % Pd/NiO and 0.1 wt % Pd/TiO2. In this study, the 0.1 and 1 wt % Pd/NiO catalysts had comparable activities, whereas there was a 10-fold reduction in performance for 0.1 wt % Pd/TiO2. When TiO2 is used as the support, the Pd nanoparticles are responsible for both hydrogen dissociation and furfural adsorption and the activity is strongly correlated with the effective metal surface area. This work has significant implications for the upgrading of bioderived feedstocks, suggesting alternative ways for promoting selective transformations and reducing the reliance on precious metals.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500011

Unfortunately, the photosensitizers in current use are mostly precious metal complexes and synthetically elaborate organic dyes. Herein, we successfully applied a low-cost triphenylphosphine (PPh3)/sodium iodide (NaI)-based photosensitizer to heterogeneous catalysis using Fe single-atom catalysts (Fe-1/C) toward N-2 photofixation. PPh3 molecules mainly adsorbed on the active carbon to form Fe-1/C-PPh3/NaI. During N-2 photofixation, Fe-1/C-PPh3/NaI exhibited an NH3 production rate of 98 mu mol/(g(cat.).h) without any sacrificial agents, even 1.5 times as high as that for Fe-1/C using tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2) as the photosensitizer. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Fe-1/C-PPh3/NaI effectively harvested photons by delivering hot electrons from adsorbed PPh3/NaI to Fe single atoms under light irradiation, together with the generation of PPh3-I-center dot radicals. The hot electrons reduced N-2 to NH3 over Fe single atoms, while PPh3-I-center dot radicals were regarded to oxidize H2O to O-2 .									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500013

Compared with most previous reports for this transformation, which use high temperatures (typically, 100-200 degrees C) and H-2 pressures (10-100 bar), this system proceeds under extremely mild conditions (RT, 5-10 bar of H-2). The hydrogenation is catalyzed by well-defined ruthenium-PNNH pincer complexes (0.5 mol %) with potential dual modes of metal-ligand cooperation. An unusual Ru-amidate complex was formed and crystallo-graphically characterized. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the room-temperature hydrogenation proceeds predominantly via the Ru-N amido/amine metal-ligand cooperation.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500014	32455053

Mass spectrometry and ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopy measurements support the existence of 4-nitrosophenol as a stable reaction intermediate. We propose that dissolved oxygen is consumed, both by oxidizing 4-nitrosophenol (an intermediate) and reoxidizing the reduced catalyst surface, resulting in the commonly observed "induction period" in the reaction kinetics. Upon complete consumption of dissolved oxygen, subsequent reduction to 4-aminophenol can occur. A complete kinetic analysis including modeling is presented, conceptually fitting data from recent reports in the literature, as well as fitting data from our own experiments.									28	0	0	0	1	1	28			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500015

Here, we present the idea of introducing favorable catalyst-reactant interaction in achieving efficient photocatalytic regeneration of nicotinamide (NADH) cofactor by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The electrostatic attraction emanating from the ligands on the surface of NP increases the channeling and local concentration of NAD(+) reactants around AuNP photocatalysts, thereby enhancing the probability of the electron transfer process. Detailed kinetics- and intensity-dependent studies confirm the involvement of multiple electron transfer from the AuNP photocatalyst to the NAD(+) reactant. The photocatalytic performances of AuNPs presented here are comparable to or greater than most of the catalytic systems reported based on plasmonic NP, with the added advantage of being structurally less complex. The use of electrostatics mimics the underlying force involved in various enzyme catalysis, which can serve as a generic approach for other important artificial multielectron photocatalytic reactions as well.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500016

However, directly measuring the lattice strain of individual catalyst nanoparticles is challenging, especially at the scale of a single unit cell. Here, we quantitatively map the strain present in rhodium@platinum (core@shell) nanocube electrocatalysts using conventional aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the recently developed technique of 4D-STEM nanobeam electron diffraction. We demonstrate that 4D-STEM combined with data preconditioning allows for quantitative lattice strain mapping with subpicometer precision and without the influence of scan distortions. When combined with multivariate curve resolution, 4D-STEM allows us to distinguish the nanocube core from the shell and to quantify the unit cell size as a function of distance from the core-shell interface. Our results demonstrate that 4D-STEM has significant precision and accuracy advantages in strain metrology of catalyst materials compared to aberration-corrected STEM imaging and is beneficial for extracting information about the evolution of strain in catalyst nanoparticles.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500017

Herein, we have discovered that Rhphotodeposited TiO2 nanoparticles selectively dehydrogenate N-heterocyclic amines with the concomitant generation of molecular hydrogen gas in an inert atmosphere under visible light (lambda(max) = 453 nm) illumination at room temperature. Initially, a visible-light-sensitive surface complex is formed between the N-heterocycle and TiO2. The acceptorless dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles is initiated by direct electron transfer from the HOMO energy level of the amine via the conduction band of TiO2 to the Rh nanoparticle. The reaction condition was optimized by examining different photodeposited noble metals on the surface of TiO2 and solvents, finding that Rh-0 is the most efficient cocatalyst, and 2-propanol is the optimal solvent. Structurally diverse N-heterocycles such as tetrahydroquinolines, tetrahydroisoquinolines, indolines, and others bearing electron-deficient as well as electron-rich substituents underwent the dehydrogenation in good to excellent yields. The amount of released hydrogen gas evinces that only the N-heterocyclic amines are oxidized rather than the dispersant. This developed method demonstrates how UV-active TiO2 can be employed in visible-light-induced synthetic dehydrogenation of amines and simultaneous hydrogen storage applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500018

Metal dispersion, metal reducibility, catalytic performance, and catalyst stability are usually strongly affected by the interaction of the active phase and support. A strong metal-support interaction has been previously reported for titania-supported catalysts. In this work, a series of titania-supported cobalt catalysts promoted via the deposition of a layer of carbon nitride were prepared, characterized, and tested in FT synthesis. The catalytic performance of freshly activated catalysts was an interplay of cobalt dispersion and reducibility. The deposition of carbon nitride on the surface of titania resulted in a noticeable enhancement of cobalt dispersion, whereas it hindered cobalt reducibility to some extent. The nonpromoted cobalt catalysts exhibited a noticeable deactivation in FT synthesis. The catalyst deactivation was due to the progressive encapsulation of the cobalt active phase by TiO2 during the reaction. A carbon nitride layer on the TiO2 surface stabilized cobalt nanoparticles and prevented the encapsulation of active sites by the TiO2 species. The stability was significantly enhanced on all titania-supported cobalt catalysts promoted with carbon nitride.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500019

Humidified H-2 is also widely used for emerging perovskite anodes of SOFCs, although the influences of H2O on the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on their surfaces have not been well understood yet. In this work, the effects of H2O on the HOR on Sr2Fe1.5 Mo0.5O6-delta (SF1.5M), La-0.5 Sr-1.5 Fe-1.5 Mo0.5O6-delta (LSFM), and Pr-0.5 Sr-1.5 Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (PSFM) were systematically investigated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) methods. The EIS spectra suggested the possible promotional effect of H2O on decreasing the polarization resistance of SF1.5M. The ECR results confirmed that the presence of H2O in H-2 can significantly increase the oxygen exchange coefficients of SF1.5M, LSFM, and PSFM. To gain a mechanistic understanding of the role of H2O, the density functional theory-based calculations and thermodynamic modeling were performed to unravel the effect of H2O on the HOR on the SF1.5M (001) surfaces. Benefiting from the increment of the oxygen chemical potential and decrement of the free electron concentration upon increasing humidity, the plateau intermediate state in the HOR energy landscape, the step of H2O plus surface oxygen vacancy formation, is reduced on the SF1.5M (001) BO2 (B = Fe and Mo)-terminated surfaces, when decreasing the slab oxygen nonstoichiometry. Furthermore, by comparing the scenarios of the HOR on the dry and hydrated surfaces, the H2O plus surface oxygen vacancy formation energies are lower in the latter case. These two proposed factors, i.e., (i) change of electron chemical potential upon the change of near-surface delta and (ii) enhanced interaction of surface H species with the hydrated perovskite surfaces, contribute to the promoted HOR in the presence of H2O. This work provides important insights into the effects of H2O on the HOR for SOFCs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500020

Computational investigations dealing with zeolite catalysts have been undertaken for decades with simple models of the bulk sites, known to be bridging Si-IV-OH-Al-IV groups, in the case where the compensation cation is a proton. Real zeolite catalysts used in practice are however finite size and intricate objects, with external surface sites and defects, among other sources of complexity. Amorphous silica-alumina may also be obtained as a consequence of zeolite post-treatments or synthesized on purpose to obtain acid sites that are milder than those of zeolites. In the present Perspective, some of the achievements in the field of the atomic-scale simulation of intricate aluminosilicate catalysts (zeolites, amorphous silica-aluminas) of industrial relevance are reviewed. Emphasis is put on the simulation of the mechanisms of post-treatments of zeolites, and on the special structure and reactivity of acid sites at external surfaces of zeolites and on amorphous silica-alumina, that is shown to differ from the properties of the bulk bridging sites. Moreover, directions for future investigations are proposed.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500021

In contrast to most earlier studies, the emphasis is on the entire mechanism, including the oxidation steps. An estimate of the driving force is made, and the main effects of entropy are included. Two different mechanisms are investigated, not only the standard heterolytic cleavage but also homolytic cleavage. Heterolytic cleavage occurs for a NiFe(II,II) oxidation state, while homolytic cleavage occurs for a NiFe(I,II) state. The finding of a previously unreported transition state leads to a lower barrier for the latter mechanism. To reach the homolytic mechanism, one cycle of the heterolytic mechanism is needed. It is argued that the use of the very unusual active site, including CO and CN ligands, is not due to the efficiency of the H-H cleavage but rather to a minimization of the energy loss in the oxidation steps. This means that the H-H cleavage is not preceded by a good binding of molecular H-2. Instead, the transition state is reached directly from the reactant state with a free H-2.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500023

As such, Cs-promoted Ru/MgO catalysts used in the Kellogg process show superiority to Fe-based catalysts at milder conditions; however, as known, the surface poisoning of Ru sites by competitive strong H-2 dissociative adsorption limits the overall rate. In this study, it is demonstrated that the use of simple electrostatically polar MgO(111) to replace nonpolar MgO as the support can significantly alleviate the hydrogen poisoning and facilitate an unprecedented ammonia production rate by its high intrinsic proton capture ability.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500024

However, only very few reports are available for the metal-free electrocatalysis over COFs. Herein, we developed a new thiadiazole-based COF, C4-SHz COF, through the reaction between 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene and 2,5-dihydrazinyl- 1,3,4-thiadiazole that possesses a very high specific surface area of 1224 m(2) g(-1), unique molecular architecture, high porosity, and abundant active sites. The synthesized C4-SHz COF displayed superior electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and excellent long-term durability. The electrocatalytic performance of the C4-SHz COF achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 320 mV. The higher activity of the C4-SHz COF could be attributed to the high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, porosity, and network structure of the pi-conjugated organic building blocks, which allowed fast charge and mass transport processes. This work validates the promising potential of a metal-free COF electrocatalyst toward the OER and its capability to replace carbon-based electrocatalysts.									29	1	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500025

EcNikA-Rul, an artificial metalloenzyme developed by embedding a ruthenium-based catalyst into the cavity of the periplasmic nickel-binding protein NikA, was found to efficiently and selectively transform certain alkenes. The objective of this study was to provide a rationale on the enzymatic function and the unexpected substrate-dependent chemoselectivity of EcNikA-Rul thanks to a dual experimental/computational study. We observed that the de novo active site allows the formation of the terminal oxidant via the formation of a ruthenium aquo species that subsequently reacts with the hypervalent iodine of phenyl iodide diacetic acid. The oxidation process relies on a Ru-IV = 0 pathway via a two-step reaction with a radical intermediate, resulting in the formation of either a chlorohydrin or an epoxide. The results emphasize the impact of the protein scaffold on the kinetics of the reaction, through (i) the promotion of the starting oxidizing species via the exchange of a CO ligand with a water molecule; and (ii) the control of the substrate orientation on the intermediate structures, formed after the Ru-IV= 0 attack. When a C alpha attack is preferred, chlorohydrins are formed while an attack on C beta leads to an epoxide. This work provides evidence that artificial enzymes mimic the behavior of their natural counterparts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500026

Herein, we use density functional theory calculations to suggest a complete reaction mechanism for low-temperature NH3-SCR The reaction is found to proceed in a multisite fashion over ammonia-solvated Cu cations Cu(NH3)(2+) and Bronsted acid sites. The activation of oxygen and the formation of the key intermediates HONO and H2NNO occur on the Cu sites, whereas the Bronsted acid sites facilitate the decomposition of HONO and H2NNO to N-2 and H2O. The activation and reaction of NO is found to proceed via the formation of nitrosonium (NO+) or nitrite (NO2-) intermediates. These low-temperature mechanisms take the dynamic character of Cu sites into account where oxygen activation requires pairs of Cu(NH3)(2+) complexes, whereas HO-NO and H3N-NO coupling may occur on single complexes.

In the presence of an electrophilic fluorinating bystanding oxidant and acetic acid, a wide range of aliphatic amines could be oxygenated selectively at the gamma-methyl positions. A vast variety of aryl, heteroaryl, and aliphatic acids could also be successfully coupled under this C-O bond formation reaction to afford amine-containing esters. Switching the nucleophile from acids to alcohols enables alkoxylation of free amines. Importantly, natural products and drug molecules such as ibuprofen, isoxepac, fenbufen, and lithocholic acid are all compatible coupling partners. Notably, synthesis of these monoprotected amino alcohols from free amino alcohols using conventional selective protection are not always feasible.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500028	33996194

The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is a prototypical example where the oxide support dictates catalytic activity, yet the cause for this remains uncertain. Herein, we show that a single descriptor-the equilibrium constant for hydroxyl formation-relates the WGS turnover frequency across disparate oxide supports. The dissimilar equilibrium constant, or oxophilicity, between early and late transition metals exemplifies the utility of metal-support interfacial sites to circumvent adsorption-energy scaling restrictions, thereby providing bifunctional gains for the WGS reaction class. In relation, the equilibrium constant for hydroxyl formation is equivalent to the equilibrium constant for the formal heterolytic dissociation of hydrogen and therefore reflects the ability of the metal-support interface to participate in hydrogen heterolysis. The ubiquitous coexistence, yet divergent chemical reactivity of homo- and heterolytically activated hydrogen, renders the identity of the oxide support central toward our understanding of hydrogenation catalysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500029

The promoting effect of Al3+ on the ZnO support for CO2 activation via the reverse water-gas-shift reaction has been investigated. The contact-free and operando microwave Hall Effect technique is applied to measure charge carriers in Cu/ZnO(:Al) based model catalysts under reverse water-gas shift reaction conditions. This method allows us to monitor the electrical conductivity, charge carrier mobility, and absolute number of charge carriers. An increase in charge carrier concentration with increasing Al3+ content and its direct correlation with the catalytic activity for CO formation is found. We conclude that the increased availability of charge carriers plays a key role in CO2 activation and CO formation, which finds additional support in a concurrent decrease of the apparent activation energy and increase in the reaction order of CO2. In combination with comprehensive DFT calculations, the impact of the interfacial charge transfer, coupled to oxygen defect sites in ZnO and CO2 adsorption properties, is elucidated and highlighted. In conclusion, the results from this operando investigation combined with DFT calculations demonstrate the importance of charge transfer processes as decisive descriptors for understanding and explaining catalytic properties.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500030

Tuning the activity and product selectivity while maintaining long-term stability, however, remains a significant challenge. Here, we study a series of Au-Pb bimetallic electrocatalysts with different Au/Pb interfaces, generating carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), and methane (CH4) as CO2 reduction products. The formation of CH4 is significant because it has only been observed on very few Cu-free electrodes. The maximum CH4 formation rate of 0.33 mA cm(-2) was achieved when the most Au/Pb interfaces were present. In situ Raman spectroelectrochemical studies confirmed the stability of the Pb native substoichiometric oxide under the reduction conditions on the Au-Pb catalyst, which seems to be a major contributor to CH4 formation. Density functional theory simulations showed that without Au, the reaction would get stuck on the COOH intermediate, and without O, the reaction would not evolve further than the CHOH intermediate. In addition, they confirmed that the Au/Pb bimetallic interface (together with the subsurface oxygen in the model) possesses a moderate binding strength for the key intermediates, which is indeed necessary for the CH4 pathway. Overall, this study demonstrates how bimetallic nanoparticles can be employed to overcome scaling relations in the CO2 reduction reaction.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500031	32455054

Herein, we propose a rational linker scission approach to induce lattice strain in metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts by partially replacing multicoordinating linkers with nonbridging ligands. Strained NiFe-MOFs with 6% lattice expansion exhibit a superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions; the overpotential is reduced to 230 mV (86.6 mV dec(-1)) from 320 mV (164.9 mV dec(-1)) for the unstrained NiFe-MOFs at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Operando studies by using synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy identified the emergence of a key *OOH intermediate on sites during OER, providing strong evidence that the Ni3+/4+ sites are the active sites and the formation of *OOH is the rate-limiting step. The first-principles calculations were performed to reveal the strain-induced electronic structure changes of the NiFe-MOFs and the Gibbs free energy profile during OER It is found that the optimized Ni 3d eg-orbital facilitates the formation of *OOH, thus enhancing the OER performance of the strained MOFs.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500032

Here, we demonstrate that a thorough mechanistic study of a multistep reaction can guide us to the controllable selective synthesis of phenyltetrahydroquinoline or phenylquinoline with easily accessible precursors. The one-pot production can be achieved, catalyzed by a well-defined, bifunctional metal-organic framework-supported Pd nanoparticles, with only water as the side product. Our mechanistic study identifies six transient intermediates and ten transformation steps from the operando magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance study under 27.6 bar H-2. In particular, reactive intermediate 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinoline cannot be observed with conventional chromatographic techniques but is found to reach the maximal concentration of 0.11 mol L-1 under the operando condition. The most probable reaction network is further deduced based on the kinetic information of reaction species, obtained from both operando and ex situ reaction studies. This deep understanding of the complex reaction network enables the kinetic control of the conversions of key intermediate, 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinoline, with the addition of a homogeneous co-catalyst, allowing the selective production of tetrahydroquinoline or quinoline on demand. The demonstrated methods in this work open up new avenues toward efficient modulation of reactions with a complex network to achieve desired selectivities.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500034

Herein, we report an intercalation-structured hollow carbon nitride sphere composed of carbon nitride nanosheets (HCNS) with atomically dispersed Cu1N3 moieties embedded within nanosheets (Cu1@HCNS) prepared by a facile molecular assembly approach. It exhibits far superior photoredox catalysis to the pristine HCNS and the modified HCNS with Cu1N3 moieties anchored on the surface of nanosheets (Cu1/HCNS) for solar hydrogen production (3261 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) rate with 7.1% of apparent quantum yield), in which the embedded single-atom Cu acts as a modifier to effectively modulate the electron structure and remarkably promote interfacial charge transfer of PCN rather than act as active sites to facilitate surface reaction. It can be extended to the nonoxygen coupling of benzylamine and derivants to corresponding imines, and the unexpectedly high reaction rate is achieved. The promoting effect strongly depends on the location of single-atom Cu in the PCN, and the coordination method is a very effective strategy to introduce single-atom metals in terms of the improvement in photocatalysis of PCN owing to the intensified metal-PCN interaction. This work opens up a window for further improving the photocatalytic efficiency of carbon nitride in terms of solar fuel production and clean organic synthesis.									18	1	0	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500035

The effective utilization of alkalis in catalyst optimization requires the fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanism. In this work, we take a potassium (K)-modified CuxO/Cu(111) (x <= 2) model surface as a case study to rationalize the nature of K during the carbon dioxide hydrogenation using combined density functional theory (DFT) calculation and the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation. Our result demonstrates the significant tuning of selectivity from carbon monoxide to methanol on going from Cu(111) to K-modified CuxO/Cu(111). The deposited K+ stabilizes the CuxO thin film under the reducing condition of carbon dioxide hydrogenation. More importantly, our study reveals that K+ acts as an active center for selective tuning in the binding, an accelerator for charge transfer, and a mediator for the electron tunneling. As a result, the K-modified CuxO/Cu(111) opens a methanediol [H2C(OH)(2)]-mediated formate pathway to facilitate the selective conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol. Our study develops the intrinsic rules of design to tune the catalytic performance using alkali metals.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500036

At the moment, most of the efforts in this field have been aimed at increasing the productivity, rather than at the control of the product distribution. Particularly, compounds with two or more carbons (C2+) have higher added value than methane, carbon monoxide, or formate, which are typically the major products of CO2 reduction. This review focuses on those reports that have described the formation of compounds of two or more carbon atoms (C2+) in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction either by H2O or as H-2 as a source of electrons and protons. The existing literature has been organized according to the main factor considered to be responsible for the selectivity to C2+ products, including photocatalyst structuration, nature of the co-catalyst, influence of defects, and effects of surface plasmon band. Emphasis has been made on remarking the current empirical knowledge based on experimental results and the lack of predictive capability that could lead to the development of efficient photocatalytic systems for C2+ production.									61	0	0	0	7	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500037

Current thermochemical methods for the formation of some lactones rely on molecular oxidants, which yield stoichiometric side products that result in a poor atom economy and impose safety hazards when in contact with organic substrates and solvents. Electrochemical synthesis can alleviate these concerns by exploiting an applied potential to enable the possibility of a clean and safe route for lactonization. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of electrochemical lactone formation from cyclic ketones. When using a platinum anode and cathode in acetonitrile with 10 M H2O and 400 mM cyclohexanone, we found that non-Baeyer-Villiger products, delta-hexanolactone and gamma-caprolactone, are formed with a total Faradaic efficiency of similar to 20%. Isotope labeling experiments support that water is the oxygen atom source for this reaction. In addition, electrochemical kinetic data suggest a first-order dependence on water at low water concentrations (<2 M H2O) and a zeroth order dependence on the substrate, cyclohexanone. A Tafel slope of 139 mV/decade was measured at 400 mM cyclohexanone and 10 M H2O, implying an initial electron transfer as the rate-determining step. Literature-proposed mechanisms for similar transformations suggest an outer-sphere pathway. However, on the basis of the collected electrochemical kinetic data, we propose the possibility that Pt reacts with water in an initial electron transfer that forms Pt-OH, which can subsequently react with the ketone substrate. A subsequent electron transfer forms a ring-opened carboxylic acid cation that can reclose to form either of the observed five- or six-membered ring lactone products.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500038

Various cyclic alkenyl and alkadienyl carbenium ions have been proposed as active intermediates for light olefin production, but direct experimental evidence demonstrating the transformation of these hydrocarbon pool species with product formation is lacking. In this contribution, the interpretations of UV-vis and IR spectra are advanced to provide detail on the species present during catalysis; selected individual species are generated inside the catalyst pores, and their reactivity is tracked. The basis for the interpretation is a multitude of reference spectra of acyclic and cyclic dienes, trienes, and corresponding protonated species in the liquid phase (organic medium or sulfuric acid) or sorbed on dealuminated or acidic zeolites, augmented by trends extracted from these spectra. Accordingly, spectroscopic signatures indicate the presence of both polymethylbenzenium ions and alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations during the conversion of methanol on H-ZSM-S at 300 degrees C. To elucidate their role, alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations are generated from acyclic polyenes adsorbed on H-ZSM-5 at room temperature. Cyclization and cleavage are monitored via changes in the electronic and vibrational absorption spectra with increasing temperature. The formation of ethene, propene, and butenes from alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations, in the absence of methylbenzenium ions, is unambiguously demonstrated by temperature-programmed reaction (TPReact) spectroscopy coupled with online gas-phase product analysis. In the UV-vis range, the wavelength of maximum absorption, lambda(max), of the alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cation is linearly dependent on the total number of carbons in the cation. A blue shift in the position of lambda(max )of these cyclopentenyl cations during the TPReact indicates a loss of three carbons, which matches the average size of the concomitantly produced olefins.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500040

By means of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we investigated the reaction on a palladium foil exposed to different mixtures at increasing temperature. Water affects the long-term catalyst stability and blocks the active sites, ascribed to the hydroxyl inhibition effect. We investigated such an effect both under steady state and transient reaction conditions to understand the mechanism of inhibition. The hydroxyl formation on the surface of palladium blocks the sites for methane activation, postponing the formation of the active palladium oxide phase in the bulk.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500041

Nevertheless, systems which isomerize alkenes with complete regio-and stereoselectivity are rare. Most reported cases proceed through 1,3-hydrogen shift (allyl) mechanisms, rather than the generally more common 1,2-hydride shift (alkyl) mechanism, provoking consideration of the unique opportunities the former mechanism offers. Accordingly, the first part of this Perspective article will cover stereoselective alkene isomerization systems operating through 1,3-hydrogen shift mechanisms, with an emphasis on the origin of stereocontrol. Next, examples where these systems are employed in tandem with subsequent transformations to rapidly form complex molecular architecture will be discussed, illustrating the potential of alkene isomerization as a strategic tool in stereoselective synthesis.									22	0	0	0	6	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500042

The catalytic property of MNPs was usually regulated through introducing modifier effects and metal-support effects, and the common nature of these strategies involved either the construction of steric hindrance on the surface of MNPs or the regulation of surface electronic state of MNPs, which inspired us to employ metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a support due to their tailorable physical-chemical environments. Herein, we utilized the MOF matrixes to encapsulate MNPs (MNPs@MOFs) as catalysts which showed good selectivity and high conversion in the hydrogenation reaction of the citronellal molecule. Three kinds of Pt@MOF catalysts (Pt@ZIF-8, Pt@ZIF-67, and Pt@UiO-66) with different channel environments (pore size, metal sites, etc.) were designed, and it was found that Pt@ZIF-67 exhibited comparable selectivity (>99%) and higher activity (turnover frequency = 42.28 h(-1)). The high selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols was derived from the steric effect of the ZIF-67 pore, which regulated the diffusion status of the citronellal molecule in the channels, while the high catalytic activity of MNPs originated from the electronic effect between ZIF-67 and Pt NPs. Such results were also validated by the molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory calculation, further demonstrating that unsaturated alcohols can be formed through the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes by reasonably designing the channel environment of MNPs/MOFs that regulated the steric and electronic effects simultaneously.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500043

The reactions proceed with high catalytic activity and high enantioselectivity. N-Methyl-N-phenyl allylic amines were indispensable to achieve the high catalytic activity, to achieve the high enantioselectivity, and to expand the substrate scope to 5- and 7-membered beta-ketoesters, whose nickel-catalyzed AAA with allylic alcohols results in low enantioselectivity. On the basis of the kinetics using a catalyst system made of Ni(cod)(2) and (S)-Tol-MeO-BIPHEP, and DFT calculations for the reaction pathway of the AAA reaction mediated by an isolated olefin-coordinated nickel-DPPF complex 4b, we propose a mechanism where protonation of the nitrogen atom of the coordinating allylic amine by beta-ketoester is key to cleaving the C-N bond and delivering a cationic pi-allyl nickel(II) intermediate.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500046

A class I diterpene synthase VenA with an atypical (DSFVSD120)-D-115 motif was revealed to catalyze the cyclization of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) generated by the GGPP synthase VenD, giving rise to 1. The unique cyclization mechanism was elucidated by C-13-tracer NMR experiments. The oxidative transformation of 1 into 2 was also characterized to be mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme VenC.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500048

The cationic Ru-H complex 1 was found to be an effective catalyst for mediating the coupling reaction of 1,2-disubstituted indoles with alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, in which the regioselective C-alpha-C-beta activation of the carbonyl substrates has been achieved in forming the 3-alkylindole products. The analogous coupling reaction of indoles with saturated aldehydes and ketones directly led to the C-alpha- C-beta cleavage of the carbonyl substrates in forming the 3-allcylindole products. The coupling reaction of 1,2-dimethylinole with (E)-3-nonen-2-one and 2-propanol-d(8) showed 20-22% of deuterium incorporation to both alpha- and beta-CH2 of the 3-alkylindole product. The coupling reaction of 1,2-dimethylinole with (E)-3-nonen-2-one exhibited the most significant carbon kinetic isotope effect on the alpha-carbon of the product (C-alpha = 1.046). The Hammett plot constructed from the reaction of 1,2-dimethylinole with a series of para-substituted enones p-X-C6H4CH=CHCOCH3 (X = OMe, Me, H, Cl, CF3) showed a modest promotional effect by an electron-donating group (rho = -0.2 +/- 0.1). Several catalytically relevant Ru-H species were detected by NMR from a stoichiometric reaction mixture of the Ru-H complex 1 with 1,2-dimethylindole and (E)-3-nonen-2-one in CD2Cl2. These results support a mechanism of the catalytic coupling reaction via conjugate addition of indoles to enones followed by the C-C bond activation and hydrogenolysis steps.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500049

Here, we designed a core-shell-structured SAEC (Co-1-SAC) with superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Co-1-SAC consists of a locally engineered single Co-N3C1 site on a N-doped microporous amorphous carbon support enveloped by a globally engineered highly conductive mesoporous graphitic carbon shell. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co-N3C1 exhibits near-Fermi electronic states distinct from those of Co-N2C2 and Co-N-4, which facilitate both the electronic hybridization with O-2 and the subsequent protonation of adsorbed O-2* toward the formation of OOH*. Engineering Co-N3C1-SAC into a micro/mesoporous structure dramatically enhances the mass transport and electron transfer, which further boosts the ORR and Zn-air battery performance (slightly outperforming Pt/C). Our findings open an avenue toward engineering of the local and global environment of SACs for a wide range of efficient electrochemical conversions.									37	0	0	0	4	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500050

The enhancement arises from the higher atomic concentration of electrochemically active Pd exposed on the surface of the nanoparticles as a result of the electrochemical dealloying process, which was verified by electron energy loss spectroscopy elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and CO stripping. These dealloyed catalysts also showed a negligible decrease in the ORR activity after 4000 potential cycles in alkaline media. In addition, after the degradation that resulted from extended potential cycles in alkaline media, the ORR activity of the catalysts could be restored by repeating the dealloying procedures, with only a 14 mV decrease in the half-wave potential after 16,000 cycles for dealloyed PdNi/C. Similar results were obtained for PdMn/C. These findings provide insights for the rational design of the composition and structure of electrocatalysts with higher atomic utilization of active materials and enhanced electrocatalytic activity, based on postsynthesis modification methods.									20	1	0	0	1	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500052

However, when molecules, such as nitroaromatics, with several reducible functionalities, are hydrogenated, Pd, like any other very active metal, such as nickel or platinum, often behaves unselectively. One strategy to render Pd more selective is to choose the proper support. Herein, we show that MAX phase powders of Ti3SiC2, Ti2AlC, or Ti3AlC2 can chemoselectively hydrogenate 4-nitrostyrene to 4-aminostyrene, with 100% selectivity, at around 3-4% conversion. To boost the latter, we loaded Ti3SiC2 with 0.0005 wt % Pd and increased the conversion to 100% while maintaining the 4-AS selectivity at >90%. By optimizing the Pd loading, we were also able to increase the turnover frequency 100-fold relative to previous literature results. The identification of this highly efficient and chemoselective system has broad implications for the design of cost-effective, earth-abundant, nontoxic, metal catalysts, with ultralow noble metal loadings.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500053

Most organic molecules, however, are colorless and require photo-catalysts absorbing in the visible spectral region for transferring the required energy and charges. The electrochemical potentials of a photocatalyst, along with its optical excitation energy, guide its selection for driving oxidative or reductive reactions. Such selection criteria, however, frequently undermine the complexity of the transformations and prove limiting. Herein, we demonstrate how electron-rich and electron-deficient photoredox catalysts, with distinctly different reduction potentials, successfully drive the same reaction with similarly good yields. The analysis reveals that the large differences between the optical and electrochemical frontier-orbital energy gaps cause switching between two parallel reaction pathways-oxidative versus reductive quenching. This finding demonstrates a paradigm where reaction mechanism adjusts to the electronic properties of catalysts and opens doors for diversifying and broadening of the applicability of photochemical transformations.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500055

Alloying Pd with other metals and using acid and halide promoters are commonly employed to increase H2O2 selectivity; however, the sites that can selectively produce H2O2 have not been identified and the role of these additives remains unclear. Here, we report the synthesis of atomically dispersed PdClx/C as a model catalyst for H2O2 production without the presence of extended Pd surfaces. We show that these isolated cationic Pd sites can form H2O2 with significantly higher selectivity than metallic Pd nanoparticles in both the reaction of H-2 and O-2 and the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. These results demonstrate that catalysts containing high populations of isolated Pd sites are selective catalysts for this two-electron reduction reaction and that the performance of materials in the direct synthesis reaction and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction has many similarities.									14	1	0	0	3	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500056

Here, taking bismuth tantalum oxyhalogen (Bi4TaO8X) as an example, we unraveled a commonly overlooked phenomenon of photoinduced surface activation, in which the intrinsic active sites generated and dominated the enhanced photocatalytic activity under reaction conditions. We demonstrated that a thin layer of amorphous tantalum oxides species was in situ generated on the surface of the Bi4TaO8X photocatalyst at the initial stage of the photocatalytic reaction, and such amorphous species were proven to be the active sites which can significantly facilitate the photocatalytic water-splitting reactions. The investigation focusing on photoinduced surface activation of photocatalysts under the reaction conditions not only unravels the reactive states of semiconductor photocatalysts but also sheds light on the understanding of photocatalytic mechanisms.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500058

However, it is still challenging to monitor and understand an MOF environment-related activity for an enzyme. Here, we developed a MOFs-in-nanochannels configuration for broadening the biocatalytic activity of an enzyme in MOFs on demand. ZIF-8 [Zn(mim)(2), Hmim = 2-methylimidazolated] grown in TiO2 nanochannels is used as the platform, and cytochrome C (CytC) is used as a model enzyme encapsulated in ZIF-8. The enzymatic catalytic process converts 2,2% azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) to a positively charged product (ABTS(+)). On the basis of current-voltage properties, the change of ion transport characteristics in nanochannels can be monitored with time. The ZIF-8 encapsulating CytC molecules not only exhibit a significantly enhanced enzymatic activity in a wide temperature region (37-80 degrees C) but also have remarkably long storage stability at room temperature. The results of quantum mechanical calculation indicate that the Fe-S bond of CytC is inclined to break in the environment of ZIF-8 owing to the confinement effect of the MOF structure, favorable for enzymatic catalysis. The MOFs-in-nanochannel configuration provides an innovative and label-free design for the onsite monitoring of catalytic activity of an enzyme in MOFs, which holds great potential in constructing biosensing platforms with remarkable performance and stability.									20	1	0	0	10	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500059

The key feature involves the photochemical oxidation of an organocobalt(III) intermediate derived from hydrogen atom transfer, which is supported by electrochemical analysis, quenching studies, and stoichiometric experiments. This redox process enables the efficient branch-selective alkylation of pharmaceutically important nucleophiles (phenols, sulfonamides, and various N-heterocycles) using a wide range of alkenes including moderately electron-deficient ones. Moreover, light-gated polar functionalization via organocobalt species was demonstrated.									14	2	0	0	5	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800016

However, as protein motions span a broad range of time and length scales, it is often challenging to identify and thus link functionally relevant dynamic changes to electron transfer in proteins. It is hypothesized that large-scale domain motions direct electrons through a FAD and a heme b cofactor of the fungal cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) enzymes to the type-II copper center (T2Cu) of the polysaccharide-degrading lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). However, as of yet, domain motions in CDH have not been linked formally to enzyme-catalyzed electron transfer reactions. The detailed structural features of CDH, which govern the functional conformational landscapes of the enzyme, have only been partially resolved. Here, we use a combination of pressure, viscosity, ionic strength, and temperature perturbation stopped-flow studies to probe the conformational landscape associated with the electron transfer reactions of CDH. Through the use of molecular dynamics simulations, potentiometry, and stopped-flow spectroscopy, we investigated how a conserved Tyr99 residue plays a key role in shaping the conformational landscapes for both the interdomain electron transfer reactions of CDH (from FAD to heme) and the delivery of electrons from the reduced heme cofactor to the LPMO T2Cu. Our studies show how motions gate the electron transfer within CDH and from CDH to LPMO and illustrate the conformational landscape for interdomain and interprotein electron transfer in this extracellular fungal electron transfer chain.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800001	32382450

Here, we study the catalytic properties of tailored Cu nanocatalysts under commercially relevant current densities in a gas-fed flow cell. We demonstrate that their facet-dependent selectivity is retained in this device configuration with the advantage of further suppressing hydrogen production and increasing the faradaic efficiencies toward the CO2 reduction products compared to a conventional H-cell. The combined catalyst and system effects result in stateof-the art product selectivity at high current densities (in the range 100-300 mA/cm(2)) and at relatively low applied potential (as low as -0.65 V vs RHE). Cu cubes reach an ethylene selectivity of up to 57% with a corresponding mass activity of 700 mA/mg, and Cu octahedra reach a methane selectivity of up to 51% with a corresponding mass activity of 1.45 A/mg in 1 M KOH.									84	1	0	0	6	0	84			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800002	32391186

Here, we performed multilayer engineering of enzyme cascade catalysis to produce C11 nylon monomers at commercially viable concentrations from ricinoleic acid. The catalysis was driven by engineered Escherichia coli-based whole-cell biocatalysts and cell-free enzymes (i.e., lipases). Stabilities and activities of the biocatalysts were improved by engineering the bottleneck enzyme Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase and introducing a cofactor regeneration system. The inhibitory effects of the byproducts n-heptanoic acid and pyruvate on the cascade enzymes were overcome, and the products were simply recovered in situ by engineering of reactions with the addition of an adsorbent resin. We obtained 248 mM undecanedioic acid or 232 mM 11-aminoundecanoic acid as a nylon monomer from 300 mM ricinoleic acid by multilayer engineering. The concentration was 500- and 640-fold higher than those produced by nonengineering, respectively. We have also simply isolated the C11 nylon monomers via solvent extraction to a rather high purity. This study will contribute to the industrial enzyme cascade synthesis of nylon monomers in an environmentally-friendly route from renewable biomass.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800004

One of the best methods to store surplus energy produced from environmentally friendly methods is as elemental hydrogen, using electrolysis in alkaline electrolyzers. Currently, this technology is hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which limits its overall efficiency and durability. One of the most popular directions is to develop cheap, durable, and active platinum-group-metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts. In this category, the benchmark catalyst is NiFeOOH. Here, synthetic, electrochemical, spectro-scopic, and theoretical methods were used to design, synthesize, and investigate novel PGM-free catalysts with enhanced durability and activity. Using an easy and cheap one-step synthetic precipitation method, titanium atoms in various amounts were introduced in the NiFeOOH structure, forming NixFeyTizOOH. One of these compounds (Ni:Fe:Ti = 85.75:7.70:6.55) shows a very low overpotential on GC (400 mV, at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)) and high current density (27.9 mA cm(-2)) at a potential of 1.8 V vs RHE. This is a higher activity toward the OER in comparison to the benchmark catalyst; in addition, the compound has higher stability at prolonged exposure to high potentials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800005

Herein, we report, a nickel-catalyzed, chemodivergent 1,1-alkynylboration, and 1,1-dialkynylation of unactivated alpha-olefins. This study not only provides an efficient and modular protocol for the divergent synthesis of propargylic boronic esters and gem-dialkynylalkanes, but also achieves a controllable, single or double cross-coupling of Ni/B bimetallic intermediates. Mechanistic studies reveal that the diboron reagent (B-2 pin(2)) plays a significant role in the dialkynylation reaction, serving as both the reductant and transient assisting group. Notably, both reactions show high regioselectivities and good functional group tolerance. In addition, the synthetic value of the products has been demonstrated with several downstream transformations.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800006

Metal-catalyzed alkyne dimerization is a desirable preparation method, due to its perfect atom economy and the readily available alkyne substrates. Controlling the regio- and stereoselectivity remains a challenge, due to the competing formation of the head-to-tail (gem) and head-to-head (E/Z) isomers. Although catalytic systems based on noble metals have been extensively studied, there has been a growing interest to replace these noble metals with environmentally benign and inexpensive alternatives. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances in catalytic alkyne dimerization, without the use of noble metals.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800007

Here, we put forward a radical relay strategy coupling photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation toward efficiently selective conversion of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD). An illuminated BiVO4 (BVO) photoanode covered with an ultrathin (similar to 3 nm) hydrothermally synthesized layered double hydroxide (U-LDH) catalyst and graphene (G) exhibited >99% selectivity to BAD (1.2 V vs. RHE). Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation verified that the hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) generated from the oxidation of water are bound to the surface of U-LDH through hydrogen-bonding interactions and the energy is lowered. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that BA is adsorbed to the U-LDH catalyst, but BAD is not. Thus, the selectivity is favored not only by the controlled oxidation capacity of center dot OH radicals but the desorption of the desired product from the catalyst before further oxidation occurs. This work introduces an alternative PEC way to achieve mild and selective oxidation of BA derivatives based on ternary G@U-LDH@BVO catalysts.									34	1	0	0	3	0	35			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800008

The Mo(IV) ions favor the adsorption and activation of N-2, while the FeS2 substrate depresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and the two factors jointly endow the catalyst with a high Faraday efficiency of 14.41% at - 0.2 V versus RHE.									26	4	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800009

The semihydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene on the oxygen-defected anatase TiO2 (110) (Ana-Ov) supported Pt-n cluster (n = 1, 2, 4, 8) has been studied by density functional theory calculations corrected by Hubbard-U and aimed to explore the size dependence of both the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculation results indicated that the adsorption strength of C2H2(C2H4) increases when Pt-n cluster size is enlarged, implying the higher catalytic activity with the same trends is a possibility. According to the microkinetic model analysis, the reaction rate of the whole hydrogenation increases with Pt-n size because of the lower hydrogenation barrier, but the selectivity for ethylene decreases because of the higher desorption barrier of ethylene on the contrary, namely a strong structure-sensitive reaction. Besides, as active sites increase along the Pt-n cluster size, the probability of overhydrogenation of ethylene and green oil formation might be increased, which further reduces the selectivity toward ethylene. The relationship of the selectivity and activity with cluster size effect could supply a clue for designing Pt-based catalysts supported by TiO2 with high efficiency in semihydrogenation of acetylene.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800010

Here, we report the aqueous-phase adsorption enthalpies and free energies of phenol, benzaldehyde, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and cyclohexanol on polycrystalline Pt and Rh determined via experimental isotherms and density functional theory modeling. The experimental aqueous heats of adsorption for all organics are similar to 50 to 250 kJ mol(-1) lower than calculated gas-phase heats of adsorption, with a larger decrease for Rh compared with that for Pt. Unlike in gas phase, phenol and other aromatic organics adsorb with similar strength on Pt and Rh in aqueous phase. The similar aqueous adsorption strength of phenol and benzaldehyde on Pt and Rh explains their comparable aqueous-phase hydrogenation activities, which are rate-limited by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood surface reaction. A widely used implicit solvation model largely overpredicts the heats of adsorption for all organics compared with experimental measurements. However, accounting for the enthalpic penalty of displacing multiple water molecules upon organic adsorption using a bond-additivity model gives a much closer agreement between experimental measurements and predicted heats of adsorption. This bond-additivity model explains that the similar adsorption strength of organics on Pt and Rh in aqueous phase is due to the stronger adhesion of water to Rh than that on Pt, which offsets the stronger gas-phase organic adsorption energy on Rh. The data reported herein also provides a valuable resource for benchmarking methods for predicting aqueous-phase adsorption energies of CS/C6 organics on metal surfaces.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800011

First, electrochemical kinetic studies of the structurally rigid [Co(L-L)] complex show that it undergoes a reductive dimerization upon reduction to the Co-I complex. This dimerization is facilitated by the planar geometry of the [Co(L-L)] complex. The dimer structure dissociates after reduction of the ligand, forming a monomer species that is active for CO2 reduction. The reductive dimerization can be sterically prevented either by adding the strong axially coordinating ligand such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) or by distorting the square planarity of the Co geometry by modulating the flexibility of the ligand scaffold. The more flexible [Co(L-RL)] complexes prevent catalyst dimerization and operate with more positive catalytic onset potentials for CO2 reduction compared to the more rigid [Co(L-L)] complex but operate with lower overall activity in the presence of a proton source. CO-binding and inhibition studies provide evidence that the lower activity for CO2 reduction of the more flexible [Co(L-R-L)] complexes compared to [Co(L-L)] is due to CO poisoning because of the stronger binding affinity of the CO product to the flexible [Co(L-R-L)] complexes. This highlights an important trade-off in catalyst design for this class of molecular electrocatalysts: Co bis(pyridylmonoimine) complexes with higher degrees of structural flexibility prevent dimerization and shift the onset of CO2 reduction catalysis to more positive potentials but decrease the maximum activity due to CO product inhibition.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800012

The O-2 evolution activity of CoAl2O4/g-C3N4 from an aqueous solution of AgNO3 under visible light irradiation was similar to 10 times that of unmodified g-C3N4 and also exceeded that of an analogue modified with a well-known Co3O4 cocatalyst for each optimal preparation condition. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the CoAl2O4 cocatalyst with Co2+ as the main cobalt species at the A site of the spinel possessed better hole-capturing properties than the Co3O4 cocatalyst, which was the main reason for the improved water-oxidation performance.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800013

To make a photocatalyst and an enzyme act concertedly, nicotinamide-based cofactors have been widely used as an electron carrier. However, these cofactors are easily oxidized into an enzymatically inactive form by photo-generated holes. Herein, the oxidation mechanism of NADH, one typical nicotinamide-based cofactor, by photogenerated holes was reported. With CdS, g-C3N4, and BiVO4 as hole generators, NADH is oxidized into NAD(+) or fragmented into ADP-ribose derivatives through a multistep electron transfer. Importantly, the fragmentation reaction is inhibited with dopamine and neutral red to coordinate electron transfer between NADH and photo-generated holes.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800014

Enzymes that form complex structural elements with multiple stereocenters, like chiral saturated oxygen heterocycles (CSOH), are of particular interest for a synthetic application, as their use promises to significantly simplify access to these elements. Here, the biocatalytic characterization of AmbDH3, an enzyme that catalyzes intramolecular oxa-Michael addition (IMOMA) is reported. This reaction essentially gives access to various types of CSOH with adjacent stereocenters, but it is not yet part of the repertoire of preparative biocatalysis. An in-depth study on the synthetic utility of AmbDH3 was performed, which made extensive use of complex synthetic precursor surrogates. The enzyme exhibited stability and broad substrate tolerance in in vitro experiments, which was in agreement with the results of molecular modeling. Its selectivity profile enabled kinetic resolution of chiral tetrahydropyrans (THPs) under control of up to four stereocenters. A systematic optimization of the reaction conditions enabled gram-scale conversions yielding preparative amounts of chiral THP. The synthetic utility of AmbDH3 was finally demonstrated by its successful application in the key step of a chemoenzymatic total synthesis to the THP-containing phenylheptanoid (-)-centrolobine. These results highlight the synthetic potential of AmbDH3 and related IMOMA cyclases as a biocatalytic alternative that further develops the available chemical-synthetic IMOMA methodology.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800015

Here, we investigate how electrical resistance (conductivity) of the electrode affects the measured electrocatalytic activity using the hydrogen evolution reaction as a model reaction. We clearly demonstrate the effect of the poor electronic conductivity of MoS2 on the electrochemical performance, as both values of the exchange current density as well as the Tafel slope depend on the level of utilization of the active material and the ohmic losses. A quantitative analysis using the composite electrode model is provided, showing the importance of the experimental conditions and good control of electrode/electrolyte system for the proper evaluation and comparison of electrocatalysts' kinetic parameters.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800017

Here, we report on methanol oxidation catalysis by copper nanoclusters (4-6 and 8-12 nm) incorporated within a HKUST-1 thin film (similar to 100 nm thick) investigated using UHV temperature-programmed desorption methods. In particular, the Cu-HKUST-1 film with 4-6 nm copper clusters selectively oxidizes methanol molecules to formaldehyde, while the Cu-HKUST-1 film (similar to 100 nm thick) with 8-12 nm copper clusters more strongly oxidizes the methanol to generate not only formaldehyde, but also CO2 caused by the formation of formate species. This study demonstrates the potential to control the Cu nanoparticle size during the vacuum deposition of HKUST-1 thin films and how incorporated Cu clusters of different sizes affect the methanol oxidation catalytic activity under vacuum-controlled conditions.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800018

Although the enzyme is known to catalyze the hydroxylation of medium- and long-chain fatty acids at high rates, no definitive physiological function has been associated with this process in the organism other than a possible protective role. We found that P450(BM)(-3) rapidly hydroxylates alkyl sulfates, particularly those with 12-16 carbons (i.e., including dodecyl sulfate), in a similar manner to the fatty acids. The products were characterized as primarily omega-1 hydroxylated alkyl sulfates (plus some omega-2 and omega-3 hydroxylation products), and some further oxidation to dihydroxy and keto derivatives also occurred. Binding of the alkyl sulfates to P450(BM)(-3) converted the iron from the low-spin to high-spin form in a saturable manner, consistent with the catalytic results. Rates of binding decreased as a function of increasing concentration of dodecyl sulfate or the fatty acid myristate. This pattern is consistent with a binding model involving multiple events and with conformational selection (equilibrium of the unbound enzyme prior to binding) instead of an induced fit mechanism. Neither C-H bond-breaking nor product release was found to be rate-limiting in the oxidation of lauric acid. The conformational selection results rationalize some known crystal structures of P450(BM)(-3) and can help explain the flexibility of P450(BM)(-3) and engineered forms in accepting a great variety of substrates.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800019	34327041

The recent work by Hu et al. (Nat. Catal. 2018, 1, 120-126) developed an effective strategy for the C-N coupling of alkyl redox-active esters with anilines by merging photoredox catalysis and copper catalysis with an oxoacetic acid ligand (LH2). Here, we present a DFT-based computational study to understand how the special dual catalysis works in a cooperative fashion with the assistance of the ligand. Photoredox catalysis is found to occur most possibly through an oxidative quenching mechanism (Ru-II/*Ru-II/Ru-III/Ru-II) with Et3N as the quencher rather than with the experimentally proposed copper complex. Copper catalytic cycle (Cu-I/Cu-II/Cu-III/Cu-I) is predicted to proceed via a Cu-I-oxidation-first pathway instead of the hypothetical aniline-deprotonation-first pathway in the experiment, and the most likely catalytic active species is identified as the (CuLH)-L-I complex. With the Ru-II/Cu-I - metallaphotoredox catalysis, the most feasible mechanism for the C(sp(3))-N cross-coupling involves six steps: (i) generation of cyclohexyl radical (Cy-center dot) via the single electron transfer (SET) from photoexcited *Ru(II )to the complex of redox-active ester with Cu-I, (ii) coordination of aniline to Cu-I center, (iii) Cy-center dot radical addition to Cu-II-center, (iv) SET between Cu-II-cyclohexyl aniline complex and generated Et3N center dot+, (v) deprotonation of aniline, and (vi) reductive elimination of the Cu-III-cyclohexyl amido intermediate to produce the C(sp(3))-N coupling product. The Cu-I-complex is identified to play a dual role in the title reaction, which acts as the promoter in oxidative quenching process and as the catalyst in the copper catalytic cycle.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800021

At the same time, catalysts with nontrivial topological electronic structures have received considerable attention because of their robust topological surface states and high-mobility electrons, which favor the electrons transfer processes in the heterogeneous catalysis reactions. Under the guidance of this theory, excellent catalysts were reported among topological materials. Inspired by the current development of catalyst and topological materials, we tried to extract a pure intrinsic physical parameter, projected Berry phase (PBP), that only depends on the bulk electronic structure. Applying this parameter to the well-known nonmagnetic transition-metal electrocatalysts, we found a linear relationship between PBP and catalytic efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) after considering the symmetry constraint. This can be used as a descriptor for the prediction and designing of promising catalysts for HER, which is realized experimentally in Pt7Cu nanostructures. This work illustrates the importance of the pure bulk band structure effect on electrochemical activities and implies an effective way to understand the mechanism of HER catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800022	32391187

Here, motivated by the demonstrated enhanced chemical activity of MXenes- a class of two-dimensional inorganic materials- toward the adsorption of quite stable molecules such as CO2 and H2O, we use density functional theory including dispersion, to investigate the suitability of such MXene materials to catalyze N-2 dissociation. Results show that MXenes exothermically adsorb N-2 with rather large adsorption energies ranging from -1.11 to -3.45 eV and elongation of the N-2 bond length by similar to 20%, greatly facilitating their dissociation with energy barriers below 1 eV, reaching 0.28 eV in the most favorable studied case of W2N. Microkinetic simulations indicate that the first hydrogenation of adsorbed atomic nitrogen is feasible at low pressures and moderate temperatures, and that the production of NH3 may occur above 800 K on most studied MXenes, in particular, in W2N. These results reinforce the promising capabilities of MXenes to dissociate nitrogen and suggest combining them co-catalytically with Ru nanoparticles to further improve the efficiency of ammonia synthesis.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800023

In this study, we designed an ideal CeO2-supported Pd(II)-on-Au nanoparticle catalyst (Pd/Au/CeO2) and successfully achieved heterogeneously catalyzed selective desaturation of cyclohexanones to cyclohexenones using O-2 in air as the oxidant. Besides cyclohexenones, various bioactive enones can also be synthesized from the corresponding saturated ketones under open air conditions in the presence of Pd/Au/CeO2. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that alpha-C-H bond cleavage in the substrates is the turnoverlimiting step of this desaturation reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800024

However, for this process to become industrially relevant, catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity, and stability are required. Here, we explore the potential of metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors for synthesis of Co3O4 -supported In2O3 oxide composites for the direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Stepwise pyrolytic-oxidative decomposition of indium-impregnated ZIF-67(Co) MOFs affords the formation of a nanostructured In2O3 @Co3O4 reticulated shell composite material able to reach a maximum methanol production rate of 0.65 g(MeOH center dot)g(cat)(-1).H-1 with selectivity as high as 87% over 100 h on stream. Textural characteristics of the sacrificial ZIF-67(Co) matrix and In-loading were found to be important variables for optimizing the catalyst performance such as induction time, methanol productivity, and selectivity. The structural investigation on the catalytic system reveals that the catalyst undergoes reorganization under reaction conditions, transforming from Co3O4 with an amorphous In2O3 shell into Co3InC0.75 covered by a layer consisting of a mixture of amorphous CoOx and In2O3 oxides. Structural reorganization is responsible for the observed induction period, while the amorphous mixed cobalt indium oxide shell is responsible for the high methanol yield and selectivity. Additionally, these results demonstrate the tunable performance of MOF-derived In2O3@Co3O4 catalysts as a function of the reaction conditions which allows us to establish a reasonable trade-off between high methanol yield and selectivity in a wide temperature and pressure window.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800025

Based on recent progress on homogeneous thioether ligands for Pd-catalyzed C-H activation reactions, we here develop a scalable metal-organic framework-based heterogeneous single-site catalyst containing S,O-moieties that increase the catalytic activity of Pd(II) for the oxidative alkenylation of arenes. The structure of the Pd@MOF-808-L1 catalyst was characterized in detail via solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the structure of the isolated palladium active sites could be identified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 8.4 h(-1) was reached after 1 h of reaction time, which was 3 times higher than the TOF of standard Pd(OAc)(2), ranking Pd@MOF-808-L1 among the most active heterogeneous catalysts ever reported for the nondirected oxidative alkenylation of arenes. Finally, we showed that the single-site catalyst promotes the oxidative alkenylation of a broad range of electron-rich arenes, and the applicability of this heterogeneous system was demonstrated by the gram-scale synthesis of industrially relevant products.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800026

Here, we present a fundamental study contrasting the cleavage of C-X bonds in ethane, methylamine, methanol, methanethiol, and chloromethane on group 8-11 transition metals (Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Jr, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au) using density functional theory (DFT). Previous kinetic and DFT studies have shown that hydrogenolysis of unsubstituted C-C bonds in alkanes occur via unsaturated intermediates (e.g., *CHCH* for ethane) after a series of quasi-equilibrated dehydrogenation steps that weaken the C-C bond by creating C-metal bonds. However, the effects of the substituent group in CH3XHn on the required degree of unsaturation to cleave the C-X have not been systematically studied and are critical to understanding heteroatom removal. DFT-predicted free energy barriers indicate that the carbon atom in C-X generally cleaves after the removal of 2 H atoms (to form CH*) on group 8-10 metals regardless of the identity of the metal or the heteroatom. Group 11 metals (coinage metals: Cu, Ag, and Au) generally deave the C-X bond in the most H-saturated intermediates with barriers close to thermal activation of C-X in gaseous CH3CHn molecules. The N-leaving group in C-N cleavage depends on the metal identity as it can leave fully dehydrogenated (as N*) on group 8 metals and partially or fully hydrogenated (as NH* or NH2*) on group 9-11 metals. Although O and S are both group 16 elements, C-S bonds always deave to form S* (losing one H), while C-O bonds generally deave to form OH* (without preceding H removal). Cl does not have H atoms to be removed before C-Cl cleavage in CH3Cl, and thus the C atom sacrifices an additional H atom to weaken the C-Cl bond on group 8 metals. This study of heteroatom removal from simple organic molecules is the first step to providing fundamental insights into H-2-based upgrading of more complex organic molecules.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800027

The initial heat of adsorption of Ni vapor decreased with the extent of pre-reduction (x) of CeO2-x(111), showing that stoichiometric ceria adsorbs Ni more strongly than oxygen vacancies. On CeO1.95 (111) at 300 K, the heat dropped quickly with coverage in the first 0.1 ML, attributed to nucleation of Ni clusters on stoichiometric steps, followed by the Ni particles spreading onto less favorable terrace sites. At 100 K, the clusters nucleate on terraces due to slower diffusion. Adsorbed Ni monomers are in the +2 oxidation state, and they bind more strongly by similar to 45 kJ/mol to step sites than terraces. The measured heat of adsorption versus average particle size on terraces is favorably compared to DFT calculations. The Ce 3d XPS line shape showed an increase in Ce3+/Ce(4+ )ratio with Ni coverage, providing the number of electrons donated to ceria per Ni atom. The charge transferred per Ni is initially large but strongly decreases with increasing cluster size for both experiments and DFT, and it shows large differences between clusters at steps versus terraces. This charge is localized on the interfacial Ni and Ce atoms in their atomic layers closest to the interface. This knowledge is crucial to understanding the nature of the active sites on the surface of Ni/CeO2 catalysts, for which metal-oxide interactions play a very important role in the activation of O-H and C-H bonds. The changes in these interactions with Ni particle size (metal loading) and the extent of reduction of ceria help to explain how previously reported catalytic activity and selectivity change with these same structural details.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800028

This has been recently achieved with AuPd nanocatalysts, but the process exhibits accelerated rates of deleterious H2O2 self-decomposition, which results in prohibitive industrial costs. We performed a multivariate analysis of 143 H2O2 decomposition rate measurements reported in the literature to quantify the effect of reaction conditions and catalyst properties in the decomposition of H2O2 at conditions used during methane upgrading. The results show that the reaction is first order in terms of H2O2 concentration and correlates with a larger particle size. The catalytic activity of colloidal AuPd is lower than that of supported AuPd. The effect of methane pressure is practically negligible, which is evidenced by an H2O2 decomposition rate only 42% smaller when the methane pressure is increased more than 6 log-units. Overall, the results indicate that methane oxidation occurs in a significant excess of H2O2 , which contributes to its radical-based self-decomposition. Inhibiting the activity of AuPd nanocatalysts toward H2O2 self-decomposition is key to achieving high H2O2 efficiency use for the oxidation of methane to methanol. This can be done by decreasing the concentration of H2O2 , using smaller AuPd nanocatalysts, increasing the Au/Pd ratio, using colloidal versus supported nanocatalysts, or increasing the pressure of methane in the reactor. The results of this study provide a path for targeted AuPd catalyst optimization for methane upgrading with improved H2O2 decomposition efficiency and high methane oxidation productivity.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800029

The in situ generated V2O3-V8C7/m-V2CTx catalyst undergoes a redox (oxidation-carburization) mechanism that results in attractive reactivity, selectivity (H-2/CO ratio close to unity), and unprecedented stability (negligible formation of coke). The oxy-carbide species (V2O3 and V8C7) growing in situ under reaction conditions decorate the layers of m-V2CTx and provide a better utilization of V sites in such a way that the resulting V2O3-V8C7/m-V2CT(x) catalyst exhibits four times higher activity than its bulk counterparts, V2AlC MAX phase and commercial vanadium carbide (VC). These kinetic findings combined with spectroscopy, microscopy, and isotopic labeling experiments reveal that while dehydrating the pristine m-V2CTx, an oxy-carbide (V2O3-V8C7/m-V2CTx) material is produced which oxidizes further in the presence of CO2 to generate additional V2O3 nanocrystals on the surface and in-between the multilayered structure. These oxide particles are further carburized in situ by reaction with CH4 and transforming into V8C7 nanocrystals. This study provides kinetic, structural, and mechanistic insights into the genesis of m-V2CTx as a selective and coke-resistant catalyst for DRM. We foresee m-V2CTx, and MXenes in general, as promising precursors, supports, and/or catalysts for various other catalytic applications at relatively high temperatures (>= 500 degrees C).									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800030

The recrystallized FER (FER-S1) with its smaller amount of Lewis acidic extraframework AI sites (EFAI) possessed proper number of Bronsted acidic sites in the eight-membered-ring (8-MR) channels in comparison to the pristine FER, which was responsible for an enhanced CO insertion rate to methoxy intermediates formed by dissociated DME molecules by referentially forming acetyl intermediates or to the highly active Bronsted acidic sites. The most active tetrahedral T2 sites with two adjacent AI atoms in the 8-MR channels having next-nearest Al-O-Si-O-Al configurations on the FER-S1 revealed the stronger adsorption of the stably adsorbed DME molecules as confirmed by DFT calculations. FER-S1 containing the proper amounts of Al atoms in the 8-MR with appropriate locations with optimal acidic properties was responsible for its higher activity and stability for the gas-phase carbonylation of DME, where the AI distributions were confirmed by Rietveld refinement XRD analysis, FT-IR, and DFT calculations. In addition, the acidic sites on the outer surfaces and larger cavity including 10-MR channels were responsible for an accelerated formation of aromatic coke precursors.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800031

Previous theoretical study applied the well-established "Norskov-Bligaard" method to screen catalysts for FAD, while some kinetic models for HCOO* and COOH* dehydrogenation involved no extra unoccupied site, which was necessary in some other kinetic models. In the present work, we use FAD as a case study to comprehensively investigate the effects of different kinetic models on the calculated maps for the predictions of the reaction activity and selectivity. The results show that trends of the predicted CO selectivity are significantly different over a series of transition-metal surfaces for two kinetic models, yielding different predictions for catalyst candidates of FAD. Our results call for a close attention to mechanism details in a theoretical catalyst design.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800033

A series of Pt-based alloy catalysts supported on silica (Pt3M/SiO2, where M = Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Pb) were prepared and tested for the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane, which has been an emerging topic in hydrogen carrier/production applications. Nanoparticulate intermetallic Pt3Fe exhibited high catalytic activity and durability. The Pt3Fe catalyst was further modified by substituting a part of the Fe with a series of metals (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Pb) to form a Pt-3(Fe-0.75,M-0.25) pseudobinary alloy. The partial substitution of Fe with Zn to form Pt-3(Fe0.75Zn0.25) resulted in outstandingly high catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability: a 2.7-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) in comparison to that of Pt/SiO2 (the highest H-2 evolution rate ever reported), >99% toluene selectivity (methane concentration <500 ppm), and long-term durability with >99% MCH conversion for at least 50 h. A mechanistic study based on detailed characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the Fe enhanced hydrogenation of CHx species (decoking) and Zn promoted toluene desorption by both ligand and ensemble effects. The adjacency of Pt, Fe, and Zn in at the atomic level allows construction of a multifunctional active site for effective C-H activation, decoking, and toluene desorption.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800034

Herein, this work reports a one-step controllable synthesis of trimetallic NiCoFe-layered double hydroxides (NiCoFe-LDHs) nanosheets (1.36 nm) for both an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and highly selective oxidation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) into value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). For comparison, two sets of bimetallic NiCo- and NiFe-LDHs were similarly synthesized and evaluated. In the OER process, the optimal NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets exhibited the lowest necessary overpotential (288 mV) to reach 10 mA cm (-2) and the smallest Tafel slope of 92 mV dec(-1) compared with NiCo-LDHs (347 mV, 115 mV dec(-1)) and NiFe-LDHs (303 mV, 108 mV dec(-1)). The performance was also superior to most previously reported LDHs catalysts. Additionally, NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets exhibited a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 1.0 Omega and a larger C-dl value of 2.62 mF cm(-2) compared with NiCo-LDHs (2.1 Omega, 1.94 mF cm(-2)) and NiFe-LDHs (1.4 Omega, 2.22 mF cm(-2)), indicating fast catalytic kinetics. Furthermore, the NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets possessed excellent durability over 10 h, much better than that of NiCo- and NiFe-LDHs. NiCoFe-LDHs catalysts also exhibited high performance in the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to FDCA, which is a key precursor for the sustainable synthesis of polymers (e.g., polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF)). An ultralow overpotential of 280 mV was required to achieve 20 mA cm(-2), nearly 120 mV less than the activity in pure 1.0 M NaOH. The reaction intermediates and products were qualified by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy system (LC-MS) and LC, where 95.5% conversion of HMF and 84.9% yield of FDCA were obtained in 1 h. The reaction kinetics and possible pathways were further investigated.

This study provides a rationale for the superior efficiency of a gold complex bearing a bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (BiCAAC). We demonstrate that this ligand motif, which is readily available, provides a durable gold catalyst that is able to compete with sophisticated state-of-the-art phosphine and NHC ligands, which feature secondary interaction capabilities.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800037

A promising approach involves direct synthesis from molecular hydrogen and oxygen at (sub)ambient temperatures using unmodified supported Pd catalysts, which are limited by low selectivities. Controlling the environment of Pd active sites via surface ligands is shown to enhance selectivity. Trends among a myriad of surface ligands (i.e., phosphines, thiols, weakly bound molecules) suggest that those containing H-bonding groups lead to the highest H2O2 production, potentially by affecting reaction energetics via H-bonding with key intermediates. These insights lay the groundwork for ligand design to achieve the optimal catalyst performance for H2O2 synthesis.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800038

A series of boron-promoted Pt/XB-gamma-Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized, tested, and characterized. The sequential impregnation of 1 wt % boron and 3 wt % platinum decreases the amount of deposited carbon 3-fold, increases the propylene selectivity from 90% to 98%, and enhances the activity after 12 h by 40%. Catalyst characterization and thermodynamic DFT calculations suggest that boron forms a finely dispersed amorphous oxide on the gamma-Al2O3 support and on the platinum particles, modifying both the selectivity of the metal sites and the strength and number of acid sites on the support.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800039

Despite extensive investigation, there remains uncertainty about NO reduction mechanisms. Particularly, it is unknown which sites are responsible for the unselective reduction of NO to NH3 under light-off conditions or in CO-rich feed. By varying Rh catalyst structure from atomically dispersed species to clusters on Al2O3 and CeO2, we provide evidence that in the reduction of NO by CO with co-fed H2O, low-temperature NH3 formation occurs on atomically dispersed Rh sites, whereas high-nuclearity Rh clusters are selective to N-2.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800040

Complexes 1, 2, 3a,b, and 4a,b, under the activation of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)(4)] and (AlBu3)-Bu-i, show high activities as well as higher than 96.6% 3,4regioselectivities, of which 1 and 2 are nonstereoselective, giving atactic 3,4-poly(1PB), while 3a,b and 4a,b exhibit distinguished syndioselectivities (>= 95.3% rrrr). However, 3c and 4c are inactive. In addition, complexes 5-7 are also completely inert although they are highly active and cis-1,4-selective for isoprene polymerization. On the contrary, the analogous cis-1,4-selective complex 8 exhibits syndio- (>= 96.1% rrrr) and 3,4-regio- (>99%) selectivity. Hydrogenation of a syndiotactic 3,4-poly(1PB) affords a syndiotactic poly(4-phenyl-1-butene) elastomer with a T-g of 17 degrees C. The cationic cyclization transfers a syndiotactic 3,4-poly(1PB) into a rigid cyclized polyolefin with a T-g as high as 327 degrees C.

Herein, an ynamide-mediated macrolactonization of seco-acids with the assistance of an acid catalyst is described. Various macrolactones ranging in ring size from medium to large can be prepared by using this method. The notorious issues associated with conventional macrolactonization reactions, such as the racemization/epimerization of seco-acids containing an alpha-chirality center, and the E/Z isomerization of alpha,beta 3-unsaturated seco-acids can be avoided using this method. In addition, the ynamide-mediated two-step macrolactonization reaction can be performed in a one-pot manner, thus offering a user-friendly protocol. Cyclodepsipeptides containing both amide and ester bonds can also be constructed using this method as the key step to facilitate the ring closure. The total synthesis of dehydroxy LI-F04a, which contains a cyclic hexadepsipeptide core, has been accomplished using this method.									16	4	1	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800042

This study provides a proof-of-concept of piezobiocatalysis by demonstrating peroxygenase-catalyzed oxyfunctionalization reactions fueled by piezocatalytically generated H2O2. Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) generated H2O2 in situ via an oxygen reduction reaction under ultrasonic wave conditions. Through the simple combination of water, ultrasound, recombinant, evolved unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO), and BiOCl, the piezobiocatalytic platform accelerated selective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to enantiopure (R)-1-phenylethanol [total turnover number of rAaeUPO (TTNrAaeUPO), 2002; turnover frequency, 77.7 min(-1); >99% enantiomeric excess (ee)]. The BiOCl-rAaeUPO couple also catalyzed other representative substrates (e.g., propylbenzene, 1-chloro-4-ethylbenzene, cyclohexane, and cis-beta-methylstyrene) with high turnover frequency and selectivity. We alleviated the oxidative stress of piezocatalytically generated OH center dot on rAaeUPO by spatial separation of rAaeUPO and BiOCl, which resulted in greatly enhanced TTNrAaeUPO of >3900 and the notable prolongation of reaction time. Overall, the BiOCl-rAaeUPO couple serves as a mechanical-to-chemical energy conversion platform for driving peroxygenase-catalyzed reactions under ultrasonic conditions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800043

Here, by a strategy merging hydrogen transfer and selective coupling, we present a ruthenium-catalyzed deconstruction of N-heteroaromatics to functionalized arylamines with 2-aminoaryl methanols. The reaction is achieved via sequential functionalization of the beta and alpha sites of the initially formed N-heteroarenium salts followed by a C-N cleavage, which proceeds with the striking features of broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity and atom efficiency, and suitability for a streamlined synthesis of some biomedical molecules. The strategy utilized will pave the way for further development of catalytic transformations of inert organo systems to functional frameworks.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800044

However, the hydrogen release rate from these chemicals is limited by the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal catalysts, which can be enhanced by light irradiation. Here, nanohybrids including a core of plasmonic TiN and multiple Pt nanocrystal catalytic centers are assembled and show, under resonant conditions at 700 nm, hot electron-driven hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane at an apparent quantum yield of 120%. It is also demonstrated that solar irradiation enhances the activity of TiN-Pt nanohybrids by one order of magnitude through two synergistic mechanisms: hot electrons and collective-heating contributions. Using the microscopic calculation of the photo-induced temperature around a single nanocrystal, it is revealed that the collective plasmonic heating regime dominates the macroscopic temperature distribution in the system. The presented data show that plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating can be used in synergy to trigger hydrogen release from ammonia borane on demand, providing a general strategy for greatly enhancing the activity of metal catalysts in the dark.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800046

Here we report a one-step, low-temperature, plasma-enhanced catalytic process for direct SO2 reduction to elemental sulfur in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) packed bed reactor. Coupling nonthermal plasma with supported iron sulfide catalyst dramatically promotes SO2 reduction at low temperatures, enhancing SO2 conversion by 200% and 100% using H-2 and CH4, respectively. Interestingly, under plasma conditions, the supported zinc sulfide catalyst showed high SO(2 )reduction activity, although it is thermally inactive even at higher temperatures. The possible origin of these synergetic effects as well as plasma influence on SO2 adsorption are discussed.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800047

In this work, we utilized in situ neutron and infrared vibration spectroscopy to show the catalytic role of cerium hydride (Ce-H) and hydroxyl (OH) groups in acetylene hydrogenation over ceria surfaces with different degree of reduction. In situ inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy (INS) proved that not only Ce-H but also surface atomic hydrogen species on the reduced ceria surface can participate in acetylene semihydrogenation. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results implied that bridging OH groups both on the oxidized and reduced ceria are active in the selective hydrogenation of acetylene. It appears that surface Ce-H is more reactive than the coexisting OH species on the reduced ceria surface, but over-reduction of ceria also results in strongly bound species that may lead to catalyst deactivation. These spectroscopic results clearly explain the reaction mechanism including not only the surface chemistry but also the nature of the active hydrogen species for selective hydrogenation over ceria, providing insights into the design of more active and stable ceria-based catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800048

We found that water seriously decreased the conversion of ethene and the yield of aromatics, suppressed the hydrogen transfer reaction, and changed the distribution of aromatics at low reaction temperature (300 degrees C). However, the effect of water became relatively insignificant with an increase in the reaction temperature. Characterization by TGA, in situ FTIR, and GC-MS and a simulation with DFT validated that the cofed water preferentially adsorbs at the Bronsted acid site (BAS) of the H-ZSM-5 catalysts, in comparison to ethene, leading to the formation of Z-OH center dot center dot center dot H2O hydrogen-bonded complexes and H+(H2O)(n) species. These species inside the channel of the zeolite inhibit the oligomerization of ethene, the olefin-induced hydrogen transfer reaction, and running of the hydrocarbon pool inside zeolite channels. We also validated that the conversion of ethene was recovered when the majority of H2O was desorbed from BAS, while the propagation of the HCP mechanism within HZSM-5 was still altered at higher temperature as a result of a physically adsorbed water-enhanced confinement effect in the channels. In addition, the role of water on the suppression of the amount of coke was investigated in detail.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800049

Here we report on the simple and readily synthetically accessible cis-[Ru(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)(H2O)(2)](2+) (1) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, 5,5'-dcbpy = 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid) water oxidation catalyst. Its O-2 evolution has first-order dependence on the catalyst following the water nucleophilic attack mechanism. The cis-[Ru-V = O,-OH(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)](2+) intermediate was detected in the reaction mixtures by X-ray absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy in agreement with the proposed mechanism and DFT calculations. To avoid a deactivating dimerization, the catalyst was postsynthetically incorporated into the UIO-67 metal-organic framework with retention of water oxidation activity. Similar results were obtained via the incorporation of cis-[Ru(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)]Cl-2, a chemical precursor of 1, to UIO-67 followed by hydrolysis. Postsynthetic doping of the UIO-67 thin film on a FTO glass electrode with 1 leads to an increase of the catalytic current by two orders of magnitude. Thus, [Ru(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)(H2O)(2)](2+)-UIO-67 is a promising building block for integrated photosynthetic systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800050

Hence, it is critical to understand the atomic structures and properties of sub-nanometer metal oxide clusters under a reactive gas environment, such as O-2 . We consider here experimentally accessible precise-size Cu clusters (Cu-4) supported on partially hydroxylated amorphous alumina and show that such clusters can access, in catalytic conditions at high temperature under a pressure of O-2, a large ensemble of oxidized structures, representing a large variety of oxygen content, of geometries in link with the support, and of catalytic activities for oxidation reactions, as seen from their reducibilities. A grand canonical basin hopping method based on first-principles energy reveals an ensemble of 24 configurations for the Cu4Ox cluster of low free energy, less than 0.8 eV above the global minimum. The low free energy ensemble consists of clusters of different stoichiometries, which are mainly Cu4O3 and Cu4O4 in the temperature range of 200-400 degrees C and under a pressure of 0.5 bar of O-2. The presence of several competitive isomers at each composition implies that cluster fluxionality impacts the phase diagram, which should be ensemble-averaged. In terms of catalytic oxidation activity, Cu4O3 isomers present highly variable O abstraction energy: the most stable isomers are inactive for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation, but isomerization to metastable isomers, that proceed with low barrier, enable to create active configurations with low O abstraction energy. O atoms with the lowest anionic character, and thus of more electrophilic nature, present the best oxidation capability. In contrast, all Cu4O4 isomers show a low O abstraction energy and a high potential catalytic activity. This manuscript demonstrates the unique structural and electronic properties of sub-nano Cu oxide clusters and illustrates the critical roles of configuration ensembles and rearrangement to highly reactive metastable cluster isomers in nanocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800051

Chem. 2017, 9, 629-634). The mechanism, reactivity, and stereoselectivity of this reaction were studied by quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical (MM) calculations in this work. To understand better the origin of such an excellent catalytic performance of biocatalyst P411(CHA)', iron-cofactor FePIX alone for the intermolecular C-H bond amination was also theoretically investigated as a comparison. The catalytic cycle includes two processes: N-2 dissociation and nitrene transfer. The calculation results show that P411(CHA)' enzyme can catalyze intermolecular C-H amination with high reactivity and stereoselectivity, whereas the FePIX-catalyzed reaction has much higher barriers for both N-2 dissociation and nitrene transfer compared to P411(CHA)'. The reason for this dramatic difference in catalytic reactivity between P411(CHA)' and FePIX is that the former but not the latter allows the formation of precursors B-(5)PR1 and B-(3)PR2, which are structurally close to transition states B-(3)TS1 and B-(3)TS2 and accelerate N-2 dissociation and nitrene transfer, respectively. The mutated residues (A82L A78V F263L) assist the formations of B-(5)PR1 and B-(3)PR2 via reducing effectively the size of the haem distal pocket. High stereoselectivity of P411(CHA)' stems from the steric effect in H-abstraction. A theoretical analysis on how para substituent R affects reactivity was also carried out. A strong pi-type electron-donating group on the substrate enhances significantly the reactivity of P411(CHA)' -catalyzed intermolecular C-H amination. These results provide valuable information for designing and constructing environmentally friendly biocatalytic C-H amination systems with high reactivity and stereoselectivity.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800052

The atomic-level details of the splicing mechanism and the role of the entwined protein-RNA environment during catalysis remain unresolved. Here, quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations along with thermodynamic integration unveil that the second catalytic (exon-ligation) step occurs via an associative two-Mg2+-ion mechanism, exclusively catalyzed by RNA, with the scissile phosphate mediating a proton transfer from the nucleophile to the leaving group. Our outcomes provide fundamental advances in understanding the splicing mechanism in eukaryotes disclosing how the catalytic core of spliceosome's ancestors self-splicing ribozymes remained conserved during evolution.									8	0	1	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800053

This metal-free process does not require the use of any external photocatalyst, as it is catalyzed by a simple diamine which, upon condensation with an enone substrate, forms an iminium ion intermediate that absorbs in the visible light region. The direct excitation of such an intermediate leads to a charge transfer (CT) excited state that unlocks a stereocontrolled intermolecular photocycloaddition with good enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric ratios and high yields. Finally, DFT calculations and experiments were performed to support the charge transfer behavior and the mechanistic proposal.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800054

Although various catalysts exhibit selective activity for FA decomposition, no active phase has been reported to be effective for both simultaneously. In this work, the FA decompositions over the bulk gamma-Mo2N and the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)supported gamma-Mo2N catalysts were investigated in detail. It is found that both catalysts showed obvious activity at low temperatures (100-200 degrees C). Interestingly, the reaction pathway was almost completely transformed from the selective dehydration over the bulk gamma-Mo2N to the selective dehydrogenation over the NC-supported gamma-Mo2N. Moreover, stable FA decomposition performances were observed with these two catalysts during the 45 h tests. The apparent transformation of the decomposition pathway could be ascribed to the acid- base properties of catalysts with different exposure facets. That is, the dehydration was favored by the acidic bulk gamma-Mo2N with a preferential exposure facet of (111), whereas the dehydrogenation was benefited from the strong basic property of the NC-supported gamma-Mo2N catalyst with the favorable exposed plane of (200).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800056

Conventional PROX catalysts are usually a platinum group or Au-based. However, low-cost PROX catalysts with high CO conversion and a wide operating temperature window are rare. Here, we design a PROX catalyst by harnessing the electronic atomic monolayer-metal support interaction between a single layer 2-D material and a metallic support. O-2 is physiosorbed on nitrogen-doped graphene, while it adsorbs highly activated on Ni(111)-supported nitrogen-doped graphene where the O-O bond can dissociate readily. The adsorbed atomic oxygen can subsequently react with CO or H-2. The proposed catalyst is expected to maintain its activity in the presence of water. Microkinetic modeling results suggest that the turnover frequency of O-2 consumption with a CO partial pressure of 0.01 bar is over 2/s at room temperature and the selectivity to CO(2 )is similar to 100%. As an oxidation catalyst, Ni(111)-supported nitrogen-doped graphene is predicted to be also highly active for ethylene epoxidation at 423 K. Thus, the present study suggests a direction for the design of various selective oxidation catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800057

Here, we explore the role of geometric and acid-base properties in the mechanism of aldol condensation catalyzed by ceria nanoshapes. In the crucial C-C coupling step, the two carbonyl adsorbates are bound to two adjacent cations. On the CeO2(110) plane, all atoms lie on the same layer, favoring the interaction between adsorbates and facilitating the bimolecular C-C coupling. Thus, the initial unimolecular deprotonation is rate-limiting. In contrast, the (100) and (111) planes have an open structure with O on the top layer and Ce on the layer below. The former O layer interferes between adsorbates linked to Ce sites, making the C-C coupling rate-limiting. Water helps in overcoming this spatial hindrance by remote bond polarization via H-bonds. Therefore, water promotion is only observed on those planes for which the bimolecular step is rate-limiting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800060

In this study, we demonstrate that the commercially available organoborane reagent 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (H-B- 9-BBN) can serve as a catalyst for the sequential double hydroboration of alkynes using pinacolborane (HBpin). This strategy, which is effective for a wide range of terminal alkynes, is predicated upon a key C(sp(3))-B/B-H transborylation reaction. Transition-state thermodynamic parameters and 10-boron-isotopic labeling experiments are indicative of a sigma-bond metathesis exchange pathway.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400022

In contrast to previously reported sulfoxide-chelated ruthenium benzylidenes, this complex is more stable in a cis-dichloro conformation and is thus latent in typical olefin metathesis reactions. The complex was characterized by NMR, UV-vis, and X-ray spectroscopy, alongside density functional theory computations. The latent precatalyst could be activated thermally and, depending on the solvent, by UV-C or visible light. In addition, an original "thermo-chromatic" orthogonal sequence was developed, further improved by the use of a thioether chelated complex, where a divergent two-step synthesis can lead to a dihydrofuran or a dihydropyran depending only on the order by which the different stimuli, heat or light, are applied.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400037

Our calculations revealed that unlike other alkenes, allylic alcohols can bind the Ti center after activation of the precatalyst via hydrolysis to give the corresponding Ti-alcoholate, which is the catalyst resting state. Next, the dissociative addition of hydrogen peroxide to Ti causes the cleavage of a Ti-OSi junction to form a Ti(eta(2)-OOH) moiety. The partial detachment of the Ti from the catalyst structure yields an intermediate with a flexible Ti center from which the Ti-OOH group can transfer an electrophilic oxygen to the alkene substrate in an inner-sphere fashion. The rate-determining process, which involves the heterolytic activation of H2O2 over the Ti(IV) and the electrophilic O-transfer, accounts for an overall free-energy barrier of 23.0 kcal mol(-1) for 2-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, in line with the experimental value of 22.3. Conversely, the outer-sphere 0-transfer-also accessible to nonfunctionalized alkenes-occurs through a more strained transition state that lays above in energy (by similar to 4 kcal mol(-1)), giving a clue to explain the low yields reported experimentally for nonfunctionalized olefins. We also found that reducing the bulkiness of the substituents in the silanol functions of the catalyst has a positive influence on the catalytic activity, decreasing the overall free-energy barriers for the outer-sphere path. With this knowledge, we developed other catalytic species with tailored steric properties based on [SbW9O33(RSiOH)(3)](3-) structure (R =Pr-i and Pr-n), which were synthesized, characterized, and successfully applied to the catalytic epoxidation of unfunctionalized alkenes. Present results clearly show that the detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms, even for complex processes, is possible nowadays and that the acquired information allows designing catalysts with desired activities.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400028

However, the mechanisms of silver-catalyzed redox reactions are generally still poorly understood, including a near-total lack of data on oxidized intermediates. Here, we present a detailed experimental study on the oxidation of a dinuclear silver(I) nitrene transfer catalyst with commonly used hypervalent iodine oxidants (PhINSO2Ar), including structurally characterized examples of silver(II) oxidation products obtained under catalytically relevant conditions. Furthermore, the silver(I) catalyst is shown to undergo stepwise oxidation to silver(II) and silver(III) intermediates; the generation of silver(III) intermediates has not previously been demonstrated in nitrene transfer catalysis. In contrast to prior mechanistic hypotheses, our data indicates that nitrene transfer occurs from silver(III) in this reaction system.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400036

When the resulting anionic charge is delocalized from carbon to an oxygen atom, these deprotonations can be catalytically accelerated by oxyanion stabilization. Oxyanion stabilization by a glutamine side chain (Gln50) was thought to accelerate C-H proton abstraction in HG3.17, a computationally designed biocatalyst that had been evolutionarily optimized to enzyme-like efficiency. We present kinetic data and crystal structures at atomic resolution for six Gln50 mutants that indicate a surprisingly small advantage of the hydrogen-bond donor glutamine over "greasy" methionine. However, tightly packed active sites (Gln, Met, Phe)-greasy or not-perform consistently better than water-filled oxyanion holes found with other substitutions (His, Ser, Ala, Lys). Although oxyanion stabilization appears to contribute modestly to HG3.17 efficiency, the role of Gln50 is mechanistically more complex than initially thought, underscoring the importance of multifactorial approaches for the design of enzymatic oxyanion holes in the future.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400001

CO2 to CO is a promising way for using carbon resources because CO is one component of syngas for the production of many important synthesis intermediates such as dimethyl oxalate (DMO). Hydrogenation of DMO provides an economical and eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of methyl glycolate, ethylene glycol (EG), and ethanol, which is often determined by the reaction conditions and catalysts with different active sites. Thus, DMO or EG is also an important carbon carrier or CO2 utilization product. Also, DMO hydrogenation is a representative reaction for studying the structure-activity relationship in C=O/C-O bond hydrogenation. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive review of the progress in DMO hydrogenation from the perspective of constructing and stabilizing the active sites. The silver and copper based catalysts with different structures and morphologies used for DMO hydrogenation have been discussed with regard to their catalytic performance and reaction mechanism. The synergy of Cu-0 and Cu+ in DMO hydrogenation has been questioned, and new active sites are proposed with more experimental evidence. New reaction routes, hybrid active sites, and the effect of catalyst structure on the active sites for DMO hydrogenation have been achieved and reviewed. Moreover, a strategy of introducing organic additives to improve EG yield and stabilize copper species has been described. This work may help advance the understanding of active sites in DMO hydrogenation and guide the future rational design and fabrication of highly stable and low-cost DMO hydrogenation catalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400002

Structure-Guided Engineering of a Scoulerine 9-O-Methyltransferase Enables the Biosynthesis of Tetrahydropalmatrubine and Tetrahydropalmatine in Yeast								ACS CATALYSIS				10	8			4497	4509		10.1021/acscatal.9b05417				APR 17 2020	2020	Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) are an important class of plant natural products with diverse pharmacological properties. Microbial platforms can produce BIAs through heterologous biosynthesis more efficiently than native plant hosts and allow for the generation of currently inaccessible BIA biosynthetic intermediates and unnatural derivatives. However, much remains unknown regarding the structures, substrate scopes, and mechanisms of many of the enzymes involved in BIA biosynthesis, which hampers efforts toward engineering these enzymes to produce alternative products or act in non-native biosynthetic contexts. Here, we present multiple crystal structures of two scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase (S9OMT) variants from Thalictrum flavum which catalyze an essential step in the biosynthesis of berberine. The crystal structures revealed the structural basis for substrate and cofactor recognition by TfS9OMT and provide further insight into the structure and function of S9OMTs. A structural comparison of the TfS9OMT and T. flavum norcoclaurine 6OMT (Tf6OMT) crystal structures identified important residues for enzyme regiospecificity, which were confirmed via mutagenesis and in vitro assays. Several TfS9OMT mutants with expanded substrate scopes toward various 1-benzylisoquinoline substrates were generated. The rationally engineered TfS90MT mutants with altered regiospecificity were tested in a yeast-based scoulerine production platform and enabled de novo production of tetrahydropalmatrubine and tetrahydropalmatine.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400004

However, in situ observation on the formation and evolution of the hydrocarbon pool species at the initial stage is still a huge challenge. In this contribution, experimental and theoretical evidence on the origin and conversion of the methylcyclopentenyl cations (MCP+) were obtained directly at the initial period of the MTH reaction. In situ solid-state NMR spectroscopies revealed that MCP+ was formed preferentially than polymethylbenzenes (PMBs) species when the HCP species began to accumulate at the transition stage. Additionally, the relationship between MCP+ and PMBs species was established by C-13-isotope tracing experiments and theoretical calculations. Importantly, this contribution highlights the importance of the MCP+ species in the whole methanol conversion process. Besides acting as an important active intermediate species for formation of olefins at the steady-state stage, MCP+ species play a crucial role in bridging the direct mechanism at the inefficient initial stage and the highly efficient steady-state stage following the indirect pathway for methanol conversion.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400005

We have now elucidated the mechanistic basis of its distinct catalytic profile by density functional theory calculations and experimental studies. Activation of the catalyst proceeds intramolecularly, giving rise to a dinuclear complex composed of a reactive palladium hydride and an inert palladacycle. This complex mediates double bond migrations with an energy span of 9.5 kcal/mol, which is well below those calculated for known catalysts. Its dissociation leads to an even more active monophosphinopalladium hydride catalyst and an inert dinuclear bispalladacycle. In the main deactivation pathway, two mononuclear Pd species react with each other, liberating a hydrogenation product and regenerating the catalyst precursor [Pd](I)(mu-Br)(Bu3P)-Bu-t](2). The experimentally observed buildup of dinuclear palladacycles during the catalysis is, thus, the result of conversion of a binuclear into mononuclear Pd-H catalyst. Phosphines, which would deactivate metathesis cocatalysts, are not liberated at any stage. This explains the unique suitability of [Pd](I)(mu-Br)(Bu3P)-Bu-t](2) for isomerizing metatheses. The mechanistic insights were used for the in silico casting of a catalyst generation, targeting complexes with a reduced barrier toward the formation of dinuclear Pd-H species, a low energy span of the catalytic cycles, and increased barriers either toward deactivation or, alternatively, toward dissociation to short-lived mononuclear complexes. Complexes with bisadamantyl-n-butylphosphine ligands were identified as lead structures. Experimental studies with model catalysts confirmed the validity of the predicted structure-activity relationship.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400006

Herein, we have developed copper-based catalysts confined within a rationally designed covalent triazine framework (CTF-B), featuring a CuN2Cl2 structure, for selective CO2RR to hydrocarbons with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.3% and an FE of C2H4 up to 30.6%. Operando X-ray adsorption fine structure analyses reveal the potential-driven dynamic formation of Cu atomic clusters, together with the time-dependent and Cu-content-dependent CO2RR performance associated with the catalyst activation, definitively uncovering that the aggregated Cu clusters confined within CTF-B are the active sites. A further probing experiment of CO electroreduction not only verifies that CO is one of the key intermediates for the CO2RR but also demonstrates the improved selectivity to C-2 chemicals, with a maximum FE of 68.4% (C2H4, 35.0%; acetate, 33.4%), possibly originating from the accelerative C-C coupling reaction due to the increased CO coverage and enhanced local pH in CO-saturated electrolyte. Interestingly, acetate is identified as the only liquid product, mostly likely benefiting from the dominant low-coordination active sites of confined Cu aggregation and favorable chemical confinement environment of CTF-B. The strategy of constructing efficient metalloelectrocatalysts by means of confinement in a covalent organic framework along with operando identification of active sites sheds light on the rational catalyst design and structure-property relationship.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400007

Mass-selected Pt-n clusters were deposited onto amorphous SiO2/Si(100) to make the PtnSiO2 model catalysts. To produce PtnSnx clusters, size-selected Pt-n was used to seed selective deposition of Sn on Pt via a self-limiting H-2/SnCl4/H-2 reaction sequence. Model catalysts were analyzed using C2D4 and CO temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), lowenergy ion scattering (ISS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), plane wave density functional theory (DFT) global optimization combined with a statistical mechanical description of the catalytic interface, and a DFT mechanistic study. Supported pure Pt-n dusters are found to be highly active toward dehydrogenation of C2D4, quickly deactivating due to a combination of carbon deposition and sintering, resulting in loss of accessible Pt sites. Addition of Sn to Pt-n dusters results in the complete suppression of C2D4 dehydrogenation and carbon deposition and also stabilizes the dusters against thermal sintering. Theory shows that both systems have thermal access to a multitude of cluster structures and adsorbate configurations that form a statistical ensemble. While Pt-4/SiO2 clusters bind ethylene in both di-sigma- and pi-bonded configurations, Pt4Sn3/SiO2 binds C2H4 only in the pi-mode, with di-sigma- bonding suppressed by a combination of electronic and geometric features of the PtSn clusters. Dehydrogenation reaction profiles on the accessible cluster isomers were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. Dehydrogenation of di-sigma-bound ethylene is computed to dominate and is suppressed by Sn addition, in agreement with the experiments. DFT indicates that, after Sn alloying, the barrier for ethane-to-ethylene conversion is lower than that for unwanted ethylene dehydrogenation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400008

Catalysts were synthesized by the grafting of Cp2ZrCl2 on the surface of amorphous silica. The connectivity of Zr was characterized by XRD, UV-vis, and Raman spectroscopy. For the lowest Zr loading, Zr is present predominantly as isolated monomeric species. As the Zr loading is increased, a progressively larger fraction of Zr forms oligomeric species and ZrO2 nanoparticles. Measurements of catalytic activity show that the turnover frequency for carboxylic acid ketonic decarboxylation reaction and aldol condensation of ketones decreases monotonically with increasing Zr loading. An H/D kinetic isotope effect was not observed over isolated Zr catalysts, suggesting that a-H abstraction is not the rate-determining step, rather C-C bond forming may be rate limiting for both reactions. This conclusion is supported by computational modeling of the reaction mechanism. The proposed catalytic cycle for ketonization proceeds via a beta-keto acid intermediate on isolated Zr sites that are always coordinatively saturated with C-C bond formation as the rate-limiting step. C-C bond formation is also rate-determining for aldol condensation, with an apparent activation energy that is in good agreement with the experiment if the resting state is a saturated ZrOH site with two adsorbed ketone molecules.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400010

This work provides a computational model for isolated surface WOx sites (doped and undoped) supported on beta-cristobalite (beta-SiO2) and computationally explores their molecular structure, degree of hydration, and energetics over a wide range of OCM-relevant temperatures from 500 to 1300 K. Ab initio thermodynamic analysis showed that the most stable molecular configuration of the surface sites in all cases (WOx, Na-WOx, Mn-WOx) was the digrafted, dioxo pseudotetrahedral WO4. The thermal stability of the surface WO4 sites was in the order Na-WO4 >> WO4 > Mn-WO4 in the OCM-relevant temperature range of 850-1300 K. A spin analysis of an Mn-WO4 isolated surface site indicates a paramagnetic high-spin Mn2+-O-W6+ electronic state, in line with literature reports. The computed frequencies for isolated surface WO4 sites agree well with the experimental in situ Raman spectra of the corresponding model catalysts, proving their existence. Finally, steady-state OCM studies showed that the C-2 selectivity was highest for Na-WO4 sites, followed by Mn-WO4 and WO4, a trend mimicking the degree of distortion in the molecular geometry of each site. Na-WO4 exhibited the lowest reactivity toward CH4 and the highest degree of W=O bond elongation.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400011

This study uses periodic density functional theory (DFT) to examine mechanisms and rates of hydrogenating MTO product alkenes and species formed during MTO that have been linked to catalyst deactivation: C-4 and C-6 dienes, formaldehyde, and benzene. Hydrogenations of these species are examined in models of H-ZSM-S (MFI framework), H-SSZ-13 and H-SAPO-34 (CHA framework). Single-step and two-step hydrogenation mechanisms occur with similar barriers for all reactants on all zeolites, with H-2 dissociation (hydride transfer) being the difficult part of these mechanisms. Hydrogenation barriers trend well with carbenium stabilities, and species that form oxocarbeniums or allylic carbocations hydrogenate at higher rates than those proceeding via alkylcarbeniums. As such, dienes and formaldehyde are selectively hydrogenated during MTO compared to alkenes, occurring with barriers 10-85 kJ mol(-1) lower than C-2-C-4 alkene hydrogenation, with formalde hydehydrogenation on average 10 kJ mol(-1) lower than diene hydrogenation. Butadiene hydrogenation is also facilitated by alpha,delta protonation and hydridation schemes, which form 2-butene as primary products, in contrast to alpha,beta routes forming 1-butene-both routes occur via allylic carbocations, indicating that carbocation stability is not the only driver towards selective diene hydrogenation. Barriers of hexadiene hydrogenation are lower than those of butadiene, indicating that longer carbon chains can stabilize the intermediate carbocations. Benzene, in contrast to dienes and formaldehyde, is hydrogenated with higher barriers than C-2-C-4 alkenes despite proceeding via stable benzenium cations because of the instability of the nonaromatic product. Hydrogenation barriers in H-SSZ-13 and H-ZSM-5 are within 12 kJ mol(-1) of one another indicating both demonstrate similar hydrogenation rates. Hydrogenation barriers in H-SAPO-34 are 12-38 kJ mol(-1) higher than those in H-SSZ-13 (both CHA) and the SAPO zeotype also seems to favor formaldehyde hydrogenation over diene hydrogenation (in contrast to the aluminosilicates). H2O increases the efficacy of H-2 co-feeds but does not directly assist in hydrogenation pathways; instead, it increases hydrogenation rates by increasing the concentration of surface protons through alkyl hydration reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400012		
J	Wang, Hongsen; Yang, Yao; DiSalvo, Francis J.; Abruna, Hector D.								Multifunctional Electrocatalysts: Ru-M (M = Co, Ni, Fe) for Alkaline Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers								ACS CATALYSIS				10	8			4608	4616		10.1021/acscatal.9b05621				APR 17 2020	2020	Moving from proton exchange membrane fuel cells to anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) enables the use of non-Pt-group (NPG) metals as cathodes for the oxygen reduction reaction, since the oxygen reduction kinetics on NPG metals is significantly enhanced in alkaline media. These NPG metal catalysts are also stable under alkaline conditions and cost much less than Pt-group metals. However, in alkaline media, H-2 oxidation on Pt anodes is much more sluggish than in acidic media, and thus, more active H-2 oxidation catalysts are required to enable AEMFCs. Here we report on a family of H-2 oxidation catalysts: Ru alloys with Co, Ni, or Fe. A series of RuCo/C, RuNi/C, and RuFe/C alloy nanoparticle catalysts have been synthesized via an impregnation method and characterized by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. We find that Ru alloys with small amounts of Co, Ni, or Fe can significantly enhance H-2 oxidation (HOR), H-2 evolution (HER), O-2 reduction (ORR), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in alkaline media. They are much more active than pure Ru catalysts for the HOR, HER, ORR, and OER, and even more active than pure Pt catalysts for the HOR and HER, but they cost much less. In particular, Ru-0.95/Co-0.05/C is the most active among all studied Ru alloys catalysts for the HOR, HER, and ORR. Thus, they are promising catalysts for alkaline fuel cells and electrolyzers. The enhancement mechanism of Ru alloys has been elucidated by density functional theory calculations.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400013

As a bifunctional catalyst, it exhibited high efficiency for direct oxidative cleavage of alkenes into ketones or their oxidation into 1,2-diketones with a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance using TBHP as the oxidant in water under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, it could be easily recovered for successive recycling without appreciable loss of activity. Mechanistic studies disclose that the direct oxidation of alkenes proceeds via the formation of an epoxide as intermediate followed by either acid-catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement to give ketones with one carbon shorter or nucleophilic ring-opening to generate 1,2-diketones in a cascade manner. This study not only opens up a fancy pathway in the rational design of Fe-N-C catalysts but also offers a simple and efficient method for accessing industrially important ketones and 1,2-diketones from alkenes in a cost-effective and environmentally benign fashion.									8	2	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400014

However, an efficient electrocatalyst is the key to determine the selective conversion of CO2 toward valuable products. We report herein an efficient La2CuO4 perovskite catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. A high Faradaic efficiency of 56.3% with a partial current density of 117 mA cm(-2) is achieved for methane production over this perovskite catalyst at -1.4 V (vs RHE). The results demonstrate that the structural evolution of La2CuO4 perovskite takes place simultaneously during the cathodic CO2 reduction process. Theoretical investigations further unravel that the emerging Cu/La2CuO4 interface accounts for the CO2 methanation behaviors. This work provides an effective perovskite electrocatalyst for ambient CO2 methanation and offers a valuable understanding of the structure evolution and surface reconstruction of precatalysts in catalytic reactions for energy-relevant technologies.									25	2	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400016

We have shown that in this metal (M)-N-C catalyst, M (Co, Mo)-C centers are the main sites responsible for OER, while, for ORR, both M and N-C centers synergistically serve as the active sites. We systematically investigated tuning of the ORR and OER activity of the porous catalyst depending on the choice of the underlying substrate. The ORR kinetic current and OER activity for N-Co-Mo-GF/CNT were significantly enhanced when the catalyst was deposited onto a Ni substrate, resulting in an advanced electrocatalytic performance compared to the best bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts reported so far. Using a developed scanning electrochemical microscopy analysis method, we demonstrated that the higher OER reactivity on Ni was attributable to the formation of underlying catalyst/Ni interfacial sites, which are accessible due to the porous, electrolyte-permeable structure of the catalyst.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400017

Following earlier studies that characterized the broad carboxylic acid specificity of McbA, we now show that, in addition to the natural amine substrate 2-phenylethylamine, a range of simple aliphatic amines, including methylamine, butylamine, and hexylamine, and propargylamine are coupled efficiently to the native carboxylic acid substrate 1-acetyl-9H-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid by the enzyme, to give amide products with up to >99% conversion. The structure of wild-type McbA in its amidation conformation, coupled with modeling and mutational studies, reveal an amine access tunnel and a possible role for residue D201 in amine activation. Amide couplings were slower with anilines and alicyclic secondary amines such as pyrrolidine and piperidine. The broader substrate specificity of McbA was exploited in the synthesis of the monoamine oxidase A inhibitor moclobemide, through the reaction of 4-chlorobenzoic acid with 1.5 equiv of 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine, and utilizing polyphosphate kinases SmPPK and AjPPK in the presence of polyphosphoric acid and 0.1 equiv of ATP, required for recycling of the cofactor.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400018	32337091

Various descriptors of perovskite catalysts have been proposed successfully for understanding either ORR or OER, but previous studies are insufficient to explain and thus boost up both ORR and OER simultaneously due to obstacles such as many different chemical compositions, structures, and metal orbital bands. Therefore, we investigate ORR/OER activities as a function of only oxygen vacancy concentration in perovskite oxides of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) to check the close relationship between delta (delta) and the electronic structure. Interestingly, the improved performance of both ORR and OER is explained by the change in the oxidation state of the transition metal caused by the increase in oxygen vacancies. Unfortunately, most previous research studies have focused on the effect of only oxygen vacancy (delta) on responsiveness. To confirm this, we performed density functional theory (DFT) analysis to find the more dominant factor on whether the activity descriptor is either delta or oxidation states of transition metals. The DFT analysis reveals that the ORR and OER activities of SSC are simultaneously improved by the reduced gap between d- and p-band centers (Delta Ed-p) caused by the raised d-band center (M-d). X-ray absorption spectroscopy has provided the exact electronic states of all the transition metals. Here, we report that an important factor of ORR/OER is affected only by the oxidation state of the transition metal in the perovskite oxide, not by the oxygen vacancy concentration.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400019

A metal honeycomb that was fabricated using a metal foil catalyst successfully demonstrated a light-off performance at a practical gas hourly space velocity of 1.2 x 10(5) h(-1). Despite its nonporosity and small surface area, the Pt overlayer is a promising alternative to Pt/Al2O3 for more efficient ammonia-slip catalysts that use less Pt loading; this is because the turnover frequency for the NH3 oxidation at 200 degrees C is more than 180-fold greater than that achieved with Pt/Al2O3 consisting of Pt nanoparticles. Although the nanometric Pt overlayer structure was thermally unstable at reaction temperatures of >= 600 degrees C, inserting a 250 nm-thick Zr buffer layer between the Pt overlayer and the metal foil substrate significantly mitigated the thermal deterioration. The undesired byproducts of NH3 oxidation, NO and NO2, can be efficiently converted to N-2 by a selective catalytic reduction over a V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst in a tandem reactor system.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400021

However, the versatile structure and complex redox activity of this material entangle uncovering structure-activity relationships and distinguishing active species from spectators. In this work, we monitored the dynamic structure of the active sites in a catalyst containing highly dispersed copper-oxo species on ceria during low-temperature CO oxidation using time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We quantitatively demonstrate that the CO oxidation mechanism below 90 degrees C involves an oxygen intermediate strongly bound to the active sites as well as the redox activity of Cu2+/Cu+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ couples. The redox activity of cerium is much lower than that of copper; however, both metals change their oxidation states in concert, indicating that oxygen activation involves copper-oxo species in close interaction with ceria. In addition to short-lived Cu+ and Ce3+ intermediates that are generated in the CO oxidation cycle, long-lived Cu+ and Ce3+ species appear in the catalyst under the working conditions. We demonstrate that they do not participate in the main low-temperature CO oxidation mechanism, which is mediated by a strongly bound oxygen intermediate. Finally, our results confirm the high potential of element-specific time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy methods combined with a non-steady-state experimental strategy to uncover the mechanisms of catalytic processes in complex multicomponent systems.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400023

The reaction capitalizes on the use of fluorinated alcohol solvents such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), which exert a strong polarity reversal in the hydroxyl moieties of 1,2-diols via hydrogen bonding, in turn translating into a strong deactivation of proximal C-H bonds against a HAT initiated oxidation by the putative high-valent and electrophilic metal-oxo species. As a result, site-selective and product chemoselective oxidation of complex polyfunctional molecules such as steroids, sugars, and pharmaceuticals is described, where exclusive or predominant C-H bond hydroxylation at a remote and nonactivated site takes place. The current report discloses HAT initiated hydroxylations in fluorinated alcohol solvents as methods displaying orthogonal chemoselectivity to contemporary alcohol oxidations providing a useful tool for synthetic planning in densely functionalized molecules.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400024

IDSs are divided into trans- and cis-IDS superfamilies depending on the configuration of the resulting carbon-carbon double bonds. Compared with trans-IDSs, cis-IDS family members exhibit more variable active site structure and versatile function. The archetypal cis-IDSs are homodimers and produce linear isoprenoids via headto-tail condensation. Recently, heterodimeric cis-IDSs containing a noncatalytic subunit that also belongs to the cis-IDS superfamily have been identified. Moreover, several cis-IDS-fold members have been found to produce nonlinear isoprenoids via "head-to-middle" condensation. In this Review, we summarize the structural features and catalytic mechanism of the versatile cis-IDS superfamily. This information biosynthesis of important natural products and medical intermediates, cellular provides important guidance for research regarding metabolism, and disease control.									5	1	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400026

Herein, we present an atomic-scale dispersed Co-N species anchored Co@C hybrid structure (entitled as Co@ CoN&C) that regulates catalytic properties in thermodynamic and kinetic processes to achieve active and highly selective CO yield in the photothermal CO2 reduction. An optimal sample delivers the maximum yield rate of 132 mmol g(cat)(-1)h(-1) and remarkable CO selectivity (91.1%), while the undesirable methanation activity, compared with typical Co nanoparticles (NPs), was suppressed. The mechanism study suggests that the CO2 Adsorption- strong photon-matter interaction over graphitic-carbon and Co NPs can enhance the light-to-heat conversion efficiency and thus induce the high work temperature, which is thermodynamically beneficial for CO2 activation and subsequently promoted the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the carbon layers improve the adsorption of CO2, and the surface atomically dispersed Co-N species weakens hydrogenation capability, which kinetically controls the reaction pathway and therefore attains the high selectivity for CO production. This study exemplifies that the microstructure design can modulate the thermodynamic and kinetic factors of photochemical reaction and thereby achieve potential solar-to-chemical energy conversion.									22	2	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400027

Their application in homogeneous transition-metal catalysis has led to many new amidation reactions. Dioxazolones are typically activated by transition metals at relatively low reaction temperatures. The metal nitrenoids formed by decarboxylative activation of dioxazolones are generally electron deficient and commonly react in a concerted fashion. "Intermolecular" nitrene insertion reactions involving preactivated C-H bonds ("innersphere" mechanism) easily compete with the Curtius-type rearrangement, but for intramolecular "direct" nitrene transfer/insertion reactions involving nonpreactivated substrates (i.e., without preceding formation of metal-carbon or metal-hydride bonds) extensive ligand optimization is important to prevent such unwanted side reactions. The ease of dioxazolone synthesis, formation of CO2 gas as the sole byproduct from reactions with dioxazolones, and the importance of nitrene transfer reactions in general has led to the development of several interesting reactions producing N-aryl amides, oxazoles, and lactams. Since the activation of dioxazolones proceeds under mild reaction conditions, stereo- and enantioselective reactions are also possible, which is useful for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen-containing compounds. This review provides an overview of these reactions reported in recent years.									39	2	0	0	9	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400029

In this work, we demonstrate that tailoring types of acid sites of zeolite-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and choosing solvents provide a compelling strategy to manipulate product distribution in tandem catalysis. The model tandem furfural conversion with acetone and ethanol (EtOH) is investigated in cyclohexane and EtOH solvents. Pt NPs encapsulated in ZSM-5 with Bronsted acid sites (BAS) only located in intracrystalline mesopores selectively mediate the tandem aldol condensation and subsequent hydrogenation of furfural and acetone by limiting the access of furfural to Pt sites and promoting the aldol condensation. A combined yield of 69% toward hydrogenated aldol adducts is achieved. In contrast, furfural hydrogenation to valeric acid (VA) and ethyl valerate (EV) dominates with a combined yield of 80% on Pt NPs encapsulated in ZSM-5 with Lewis acid sites (LAS) and BAS in both zeolitic micropores and intracrystalline mesopores. The concentration of EtOH in the reaction system is identified as another key parameter in selectivity control: (1) low EtOH concentrations (EtOH to furfural ratio of <5) suppress the catalytic transfer hydrogenation pathway and favor the formation of 2-methylfuran (MF) from furfural, as most hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps occur on Pt NPs, (2) modest EtOH concentrations (EtOH to furfural ratio of 5-10) favor VA/EV by enabling the catalytic transfer hydrogenation pathway in zeolitic micropores and exposing intermediates to BAS prior to Pt NPs, and (3) high EtOH concentrations (EtOH to furfural ratio of >10) suppress the production of VA/EV by excessive water formation via acid-catalyzed etherification of EtOH. Therefore, tailoring the nature of active sites and changing the solvent composition are both effective strategies in manipulating the product distribution in tandem catalysis.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400030

In this work, the inhibiting role of CO on the chemistry responsible for the abatement of methane (CH4) is studied on a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst using a multitechnique approach combined with modulated excitation and mass spectrometry to obtaiun operando conditions. Identical modulation experi- ments were performed using X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption, and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy by pulsing alternately CH4 and O-2 or CH4 + CO and O-2 at 320 degrees C in the absence of steam. During the O-2 pulse, reoxidation of metallic Pd was observed to occur in two steps that are associated with the initial formation of a surface layer followed by crystalline PdO. The time-resolved study showed that reduction is faster than oxidation and that it is promoted by the presence of CO. Beside determining the redox properties of the catalyst under these conditions, the presence of hydrides and Pd carbide-like species could be followed by exploiting phase-sensitive detection and its power to enhance subtle changes in the spectroscopy and diffraction data. While at the beginning of the reduction pulse CO2 was produced from reaction of CH4 with PdO, CH4 decomposition occurred on reduced Pd within the reduction pulse. In the presence of CO, CH4 oxidation at the beginning of the reduction pulse was significantly limited by reaction of CO with PdO and by blockage of the accessible Pd surface by CO adsorption.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400033

Here, we report the extracellular production of MHETase in an active form with a proper folding. Based on the structural observations and biochemical experiments, we reveal that MHETase also functions as exo-PETase by hydrolyzing the synthesized PET pentamer. We further present that MHETase has a hydrolysis activity against the termini-generated PET film, demonstrating the exo-PETase function of the enzyme. We also develop a MHETase(R411K/S416A/F424I) variant with a higher BHET activity, and the variant exhibits an enhanced degradation activity against the PET film. Based on these results, we propose that MHETase plays several roles in the biodegradation of PET using the BHETase and exo-PETase activities as well as the MHET hydrolysis function.									10	0	0	0	6	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400034

Isotopic labeled IR spectra and DFT calculation disclosed that rather than the traditional 960 cm(-1) band, the Ti-O-Si sites dominating an unusual band at 930 cm(-1) endowed Ti-MWW with much higher activity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400035

A Potential Role of Cationic Cobalt(I) Intermediates								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4337	4348		10.1021/acscatal.9b05455				APR 3 2020	2020	Coupling reactions of feedstock alkenes are promising, but few of these reactions are practiced industrially. Even though recent advances in the synthetic methodology have led to excellent regio- and enantioselectivies in the dimerization reactions between 1,3-dienes and acrylates, the efficiency as measured by the turnover numbers (TONs) in the catalyst has remained modest. Through a combination of reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) of a prototypical dimerization reaction and characterization of isolated low-valent cobalt catalyst precursors involved, several important details of the mechanism of this reaction have emerged. (i) The prototypical reaction has an induction period that requires at least 2 h of stir time to generate the competent catalyst. (ii) Reduction of a Co(II) complex to a Co(I) complex and subsequent generation of a cationic [Co-(I)](+) species are responsible for this delay. (iii) Through RPKA using in situ infrared spectroscopy, same excess experiments reveal inhibition by the product toward the end of the reaction, and no catalyst deactivation is observed as long as the diene is present in the medium. The low TON observed is most likely the result of the inherent instability of the putative cationic Co(I) species that catalyzes the reaction. (iv) Different excess experiments suggest that the reaction is first order in the diene and zero order in the acrylate. (v) Catalyst loading experiments show that the catalyst is first order. The orders in the various regents were further confirmed by variable time normalization analysis. (vi) A mechanism based on oxidative dimerization [via Co(I)/Co(III)-cycle] is proposed. Based on the results of this study, it is possible to increase the TON by a factor of 10 by conducting the reaction at an increased concentration of the starting materials, especially the diene, which seems to stabilize the catalytic species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000037	32457820

Here, we report a simple, scalable, and reproducible strategy to prepare 2D phosphate nanosheets by forming a layered structure in situ from phytic acid (PTA) and transition metal precursors. Controlled combustion of the organic groups of PTA results in interlayer carbon, which keeps the layers apart during the formation of phosphate, and the removal of this carbon results in ultrathin nanosheets with controllable layers. Applying this concept to vanadyl phosphate synthesis, we show that the method yields 2D ultrathin nanosheets of the orthorhombic beta-form, exposing abundant V4+/V5+ redox sites and oxygen vacancies. We demonstrate the high catalytic activity of this material in the vapor-phase aerobic oxidation of ethyl lactate to ethyl pyruvate. Importantly, these beta-VOPO4 compounds do not get hydrated, thereby reducing the competing hydrolysis reaction by water byproducts. The result has superior selectivity to ethyl pyruvate compared to analogous vanadyl phosphates. The catalysts are highly stable, maintaining a steady-state conversion of similar to 90% (with >80% selectivity) for at least 80 h on stream. This "self-exfoliated" synthesis protocol opens opportunities for preparing structurally diverse metal phosphates for catalysis and other applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000002	32953234	
J	Kopac, Drejc; Likozar, Blaz; Hus, Matej								How Size Matters: Electronic, Cooperative, and Geometric Effect in Perovskite-Supported Copper Catalysts for CO2 Reduction								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4092	4102		10.1021/acscatal.9b05303				APR 3 2020	2020	In heterogeneous catalysis, bifunctional catalysts often outperform one-component catalysts. The activity is also strongly influenced by the morphology, size, and distribution of catalytic particles. For CO2 hydrogenation, the size of the active copper area on top of the SrTiO3 perovskite catalyst support can affect the activity, selectivity, and stability. Here, a detailed theoretical study of the effect of bifunctionality on an important chemical CO2 transformation reaction, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, is presented. Using density functional theory computation results for the RWGS pathway on three surfaces, namely, Cu(111), SrTiO3, and the Cu/SrTiO3 interface between both solid phases, we construct the energy landscape of the reaction. The adsorbate-adsorbate lateral interactions are taken into account for catalytic surfaces, which show a sufficient intermediate coverage. The mechanism, combining all three surfaces, is used in mesoscale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to study the turnover and yield for CO production as a function of particle size. It is shown that the reaction proceeds faster at the interface. However, including copper and the support sites in addition to the interface accelerates the conversion even further, showing that the bifunctionality of the catalyst manifests in a more complex interplay between the phases than just the interface effect, such as the hydrogen spillover. We identify three distinct effects, the electronic, cooperative, and geometric effects, and show that the surrounded smaller Cu features on the set of supporting SrTiO3 show a higher CO formation rate, resulting in a decreasing RWGS model trend with the increasing Cu island size. The findings are in parallel with experiments, showing that they explain the previously observed phenomena and confirming the size sensitivity for the catalytic RWGS reaction.									12	1	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000012	32953235

However, the kinetically sluggish AOR has prohibitively hindered the attractive direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC) applications. Here, we report an efficient AOR catalyst, in which ternary PtIrNi alloy nanoparticles well dispersed on a binary composite support consisting of porous silicon dioxide (SiO2) and carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotube (PtIrNi/SiO2-CNT-COOH) through a sonochemical-assisted synthesis method. The PtIrNi alloy nanoparticles, with the aid of abundant OHad provided by porous SiO2 and the improved electrical conductivity by CNTs, exhibit remarkable catalytic activity for the AOR in alkaline media. It is evidenced by a lower onset potential (similar to 0.40 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) at room temperature than that of commercial PtIr/C (ca. 0.43 V vs RHE). Increasing NH3 concentrations and operation temperatures can significantly enhance AOR activity of this PtIrNi nanoparticle catalyst. Specifically, the catalyst at the temperature of 80 degrees C exhibits a much lower onset potential (similar to 0.32 V vs RHE) and a higher peak current density, indicating that DAFCs operated at a higher temperature are favorable for increased performance. Constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the Pt-Ir ensembles on {100}-terminated surfaces serve as the active site. The introduction of Ni raises the center energy of the density of states projected onto the group d-orbitals of surface sites and thus lowers the theoretical onset potential for *NH2 dehydrogenation to *NH compared to Pt and Pt3Ir alloy.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000001

Herein, we report a facile citric acid-assisted hydrothermal process for the fabrication of porous Fe-doped CeO2 with flower-like morphology that can drastically promote the catalytic activities of CeO, with high durability. Among the synthesized catalysts, the one with well-defined (110) and (100) planes is highly active for H,S-selective oxidation with H2S conversion and sulfur selectivity of almost 100% at 220 degrees C, superior to most of the reported Cebased catalysts. Meanwhile, outstanding catalytic stability is achieved because the presence of Fe ions alleviates ceria deactivation due to sulfation. The results of systematic investigation prove that the doping of Fe not only raises the density of oxygen vacancies but also promotes the redox ability and oxygen activity of the catalyst. We conducted in situ DRIFTS (diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to disclose the reaction mechanism of H,S oxidation. The derived insights are important for the design of efficient ceria-related catalysts for practical applications.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000003

Here, we analyzed the activity of Cu and Fe sites with various nuclearities and coordinations in *BEA zeolites toward complete oxidation of methane, toluene, and ethanol by molecular oxygen. Spectral analysis of the interaction of methane with the individual Cu and Fe sites and a kinetic study show that the oxidation of methane is catalyzed by different active sites with different activation energies. In the low-temperature region (225-325 degrees C), the activity is primarily caused by reactive bridging oxygen atoms in dimeric Cu and Fe clusters. Isolated Fe3+-oxo ions in the octahedral coordination and Cu2+ partially charge-balanced by the framework with less rigid redox states contribute to the activity at higher temperatures of >= 350 degrees C. The isolated Fe3+-oxo ions tetrahedrally coordinated to the framework oxygen and the bare Cu2+ ions charge-balanced exclusively by the framework are strongly stabilized and cannot act as active sites. Oxidation of the hydrocarbons over both the dimeric and isolated Cu and Fe active sites is nonspecific with practically barrierless consecutive reactions of already activated molecules and therefore fully CO2-selective for all of the hydrocarbons in an excess of oxygen.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000004

The chemical state of surface Ce, which is associated with Lewis acidity and hence the adsorption/activation energy of reactants on the surface, is expected to vary with their hosted facets. Unfortunately, traditional surface tools fail to differentiate/quantify them among hosted facets and thus have led to different interpretations among researchers in the past decades. Herein, probe-assisted nuclear magnetic resonance is employed for the surface investigation of different CeO2 facets. They not only allow differentiation of the surface Ce atoms between hosted facets at high resolution but can also provide their corresponding concentrations. The as-established facet fingerprint of CeO2 can thus report on the facet distribution/concentration of a given CeO2 sample. Dephosphorylation and H2O2 reduction were tested as probe reactions to demonstrate the importance of obtaining comprehensive surface Ce information for the active site identification and the rational design of CeO2-based catalysts. Around 1000 and 4500% increase in activity of those reactions can be easily achieved on pristine CeO2 without further surface engineering when its terminal facet is wisely chosen. Our results thus imply that the basic surface knowledge of even a simple catalyst can be more important than the continuous development of their fancy derivatives without clear guidance.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000005

Transition-metal-based electrocatalysts, which provide the possibility for the realization of low-cost, high-activity, and stable OER in alkaline solution, therefore have attracted significant research interest in recent years. A fundamental understanding of composition-structure-activity relationships for these electrocatalysts is essential to guide the design of practical electrocatalysts for industrial applications. With more advanced ex situ and in situ techniques to determine the active sites, there has been increasing evidence revealing the critical role of Fe in the high performance of Fe-containing transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Here, we present a critical review of recent progress in Fe-containing electrocatalysts for OER, highlighting the significant role of Fe in enhancing the OER activity. We outline the historical development of the Fe-containing electrocatalysts, summarize the conflicting viewpoints on catalytic active sites, and offer guidelines for more rigorous identification. The synthesis techniques and the major challenges in improving the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability are discussed. Finally, a perspective regarding emerging issues yet to be explored for developing OER electrocatalysts for practical applications are also provided.									105	1	0	0	6	0	106			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000007

One promising route to lowering the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is to reduce it to useful small molecules via photoelectrocatalytic hydrogenation, which would enable solar energy storage with a zero-carbon emission cycle and perform a more efficient separation of the photogenerated electron and hole pair than pure photocatalysis. Indeed, photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction has been an intense focus of research. Using the density functional theory (DFT), we studied the CO2 reduction reaction on the defective anatase TiO2 (101) surface, at both the solvent/catalyst and the electrolyte/catalyst interfaces. The analysis of the electronic structure of the surface shows a contrast between the solvent/catalyst and the electrolyte/catalyst interfaces, which results in the two corresponding catalytic cycles being distinct. Our study explains at the electronic and mechanistic levels why methanol is the main product in the presence of the electrolyte and why the overpotential is not only controlled by the reaction process but also by the diffusion process.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000008

For instance, adding a CO-selective cocatalyst like Ag to Cu shifts the latter's CO(2)R1z,selectiiiity toward C-2 products, but the underlying cause of the change is unclear. Herein, we show that, during CO2RR, the abundant CO availability at Cu Ag boundaries facilitates C-C coupling on Cu to selectively generate ethanol through an therwise closed pathway. Oxide-derived Cu nanowires mixed with 20 rim Ag particles (Cu:Ag mule ratio of 1:20) catalyzed CO2 reduction Vto ethanol with a maximum current density of 4.1 tnA/cm(2) and ethanol/ethylene Faradaic efficiency ratio of 1.1 at 1.1 vs RHE.

Ni doping has been shown to improve the catalytic activity and produces active sites for the decomposition of methane. In this work, Ni:CZO NPs were synthesized via a two-step co-precipitation/molten salt synthesis to compare Ni distribution, oxygen vacancy concentration, and catalytic activity relative to a reference state-of-the-art catalyst prepared by a sol-gel-adsorptive deposition technique. To better understand the dispersion of Ni and oxygen vacancy formation in these materials, the Ni concentration, position, and reaction time were varied in the synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show a homogeneous, cubic phase with little to no segregation of Ni/NiO. Catalytic activity measurements, performed via a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)/thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method, displayed a 5-fold increase in the activity per surface area with an order of magnitude decrease in the coking rate for the particles synthesized by the molten salt method. Additionally, this approach resulted in an order of magnitude increase in oxygen vacancies, which is attributed to the high dispersion of Ni2+ ions in the NP core. This ability of controlling the oxygen vacancies in the lattice is expected to impact other such systems, which utilize the substrate redox cyclability to drive conversion via, e.g., a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000010

Surprisingly, the exact chemical mechanism is still widely discussed in the literature. In order to disentangle photochemical from thermal reaction steps and gain insights on the atomic level, we use a Pt cluster-loaded TiO2(110) photocatalyst in very well-defined environments. Using Auger electron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption/reaction, isotopic labeling, and isothermal photoreactions, it is possible to identify the surface species present on the catalyst under photocatalytic conditions. Furthermore, an initial conditioning of the photocatalyst is observed and attributed to thermal dehydrogenation of methanol to CO species on the cluster. The analysis of the isothermal photoreactions reveals that the photo-oxidation kinetics are not significantly affected by cocatalyst loading. The observed conversion and product distribution of formaldehyde and methyl formate can be rationalized with kinetic parameters gained from the bare TiO2(110) crystal. The work leads to a detailed mechanistic understanding of the surface species and paves the way for an educated microkinetic modeling approach, which may be extended to a variety of noble metal cocatalysts and other TiO2 modifications.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000011

In particular, the conversion of CO2 into multicarbon products is of technological significance. Cu is the only transition metal that is able to catalyze the CO2RR to produce C2+ hydrocarbons, but the catalytic selectivity of pristine Cu is low. Herein we report a facile method to largely enhance the C2+ selectivity of polycrystalline Cu toward the CO2RR. By coating the Cu surface with a 50 nm thick film of polyaniline (PANI), the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ hydrocarbons was increased from ca. 15% to 60% at -1.1 VRHE in KHCO3 solutions. When applying the PANI coating onto Cu nanoparticles, the FE of C2+ hydrocarbons can even reach 80%, with the FE of ethylene over 40%. Such performance remained stable in a test period of 20 h. The superiority of the Cu/PANI interface is not due to the change in the morphology or the electronic properties of the Cu substrate but instead is due to an improvement in the coverage and interaction of the CO intermediate, which facilitates the CO-CO coupling, as revealed by in situ infrared spectroscopy. This study opens an avenue to tuning the catalytic activity and selectivity of Cu toward the CO2RR, not through the structure of the catalyst but through the environment above the surface.									46	1	0	0	3	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000013

Microkinetic models formulated using DFT energetics derived on the clean Pt(100) and Pt(111) required large parameter adjustments to reproduce the experimentally measured apparent activation energies and reaction orders. Further, these models predicted high surface coverage of adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO*), inconsistent with the environment of the active site in the DFT calculations on the clean surfaces. Consequently, we reperformed DFT calculations for the entire reaction network on partially CO*-covered (4/9 monolayer, ML) Pt(111) and Pt(100). The resultant microkinetic models, with thermochemistry and kinetics explicitly dependent on CO* coverage, were able to reproduce the experimentally determined activation energies and reaction orders, in addition to being self-consistent in CO* coverage. Our results suggest that Pt(100) is likely poisoned by CO* under typical reaction conditions and does not contribute significantly to the experimentally observed reactivity. Instead, we find that Pt(111) better represents the active site for FA decomposition reaction on Pt/C catalysts. The optimized model on 4/9 ML CO*covered Pt(111) suggests that the reaction occurs via the carboxyl (COOH*) intermediate and that the spectator CO*-assisted pathways play a significant role under reaction conditions. This study underscores the importance of spectator species on the energetics and the mechanism of a catalytic reaction and their key role in developing a model that better addresses the nature of the active site under realistic catalytic reaction conditions.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000014

Kinetic studies, isotopic labeling experiments with O-18(2), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) were applied to explore the reaction mechanism and the surface of the catalyst before and after reductive pretreatments. It was found that pure iron oxide was catalytically active in CO oxidation, and experimental evidence for a Mars van Krevelen mechanism between CO and lattice O was found. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) for small Pt NPs (<= 3 nm) supported on iron oxide and normalized to the number of Pt atoms located at the periphery of the Pt-support interface were similar under reaction conditions, indicating that the reaction mainly proceeds at the interface. However, with increasing particle size, the contribution of a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism of chemisorbed CO and O-2 in addition to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism increases. After reductive pretreatment, the activity of the catalyst decreased significantly, which could be related to partial encapsulation of the monometallic Pt NPs with FeOx. To study whether also on the nanoscale an interaction between Pt and iron oxide similar to the beneficial or detrimental SMSI effect observed for the Pt particles supported on iron oxide can also be achieved, bimetallic Fe-Pt NPs of a mean size of 3-4 nm were deposited on inert Al2O3. It could be shown that surface segregation of Fe and formation of FeOx after reduction and exposure to oxygen took place. As a result, the activity of bimetallic NPs decreased due to loss of active Pt surface, revealing an effect similar to the detrimental SMSI detected for Pt NPs on FeOx support after reductive pretreatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000016

Its metabolite, (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine, has been found to have a similar antidepressant effect but with less undesirable side effects, which make this compound an interesting target for synthesis. Using the first-sphere mutagenesis of the cytochrome P450 154E1 from Thermobifida fusca YX, we constructed a triple mutant that enables the effective production of (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine from (S)-ketamine. This engineered P450 monooxygenase catalyzes the consecutive oxidative N-demethylation and highly regio- and stereoselective C6-hydroxylation reactions leading directly to the desired product with 85% product selectivity. The integration of this selective monooxygenase into an Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst allowed the production of (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine at a semipreparative scale. The metabolite was purified and its structure was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000017
