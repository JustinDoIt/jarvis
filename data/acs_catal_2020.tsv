While numerous works were devoted to understand the effect of the electrolyte composition on the physical properties of the catalysts' surface, very little is known yet about its exact impact on the OER kinetics parameters. In this work, we reveal that the origin for the electrolyte-dependent OER activity for Co-based catalysts originates from two different effects. Increasing the alkaline electrolyte concentration for La1-xSrxCoO3-delta perovskites with x > 0 and for amorphous CoOOH increases the pre-exponential factor, which can be explained either by an increase of the concentration of active sites or by a change in the entropy of activation. However, changing the alkali cation results in a decrease of the apparent activation enthalpy for Fe-containing amorphous films, traducing a change in intermediates' binding energies.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000018		
J	Wei, Changcheng; Yu, Qijun; Li, Jinzhe; Liu, Zhongmin								Coupling Conversion of n-Hexane and CO over an HZSM-5 Zeolite: Tuning the H/C Balance and Achieving High Aromatic Selectivity								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4171	4180		10.1021/acscatal.9b05619				APR 3 2020	2020	The coupling conversion of n-hexane (a model compound of naphtha) and CO was conducted over an HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. A significant increase in the aromatic selectivity and dramatic decrease in the alkane selectivity were simultaneously achieved by adjusting the H/C ratio of the reactants. Under suitable conditions, the aromatic selectivity was 80%, which far exceeds the theoretical value for the conversion of only n-hexane over HZSM-5. Detailed studies revealed that the high aromatic selectivity originated from the direct incorporation of CO into the products. Different characterization methods were used to elucidate the coupling reaction mechanism. Important reaction intermediates, such as acyl groups and oxygenates (substituted cyclopentenones), were detected. Isotope labeling studies revealed that oxygenates were formed by (CO)-C-13 incorporation into alkyl species, and they could transform into aromatic products. Based on these findings, a plausible reaction mechanism of the coupling transformation was proposed. The coupling effect between n-hexane and CO over HZSM-5 demonstrated in this work contradicts the traditional view that metal catalysts are indispensable for the highly selective conversion of naphtha to aromatics. This type of coupling reaction might have great potential for industrial applications, considering the large existing supply capacities of CO and alkanes.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000019

Significant primary kinetic isotope effects have usually been interpreted as being a result of isotope substitution at a site of bond breaking (or forming) in the rate-determining step in the reaction mechanism. However, quantitative analysis of the magnitude of the KIE in complex multistep reaction mechanisms is seldom reported. We prove here that the logarithm of the rate ratio for two isotopes is the weighted average over all species in the mechanism of their standard-state free-energy difference between the two isotopes, divided by RT. The weighting factor is the degree of rate control (DRC) for that species (e.g., transition state, intermediate, reactant) when the rate is measured separately for each isotope. It is instead the degree of selectivity ratio control (DSRC) when the KIE is measured as the product selectivity in a parallel competition between two isotopes within the same reactant molecule. Since only a few species have nonzero DRCs (or DSRCs) for most reactions, only these few contribute to this weighted average and the KIE. We show that this provides a simple way to interpret and quantitatively predict kinetic isotope effects that is powerful in the insights it provides, allowing one to evaluate directly which species contribute most to the KIE. By applying it to H/D KIEs in several example mechanisms, we further show that the traditional way of interpreting KIEs that focuses only on the rate-determining step can easily lead to misunderstanding of KIE and the reaction mechanism. This highlights the importance to consider the effect of isotope substitution on the energies of all species with large DRCs (i.e., those whose energies are kinetically relevant). This method also offers opportunities for quantitative validation of mechanism-based microkinetic models.									8	0	1	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000020

High-resolution HAADF-STEM coupled with in situ and tomographic analyses have been undertaken on a platinum (Pt) active phase supported on chlorinated alumina (gamma-Al2O3) with 0.3 and 1 wt % Pt loadings, highlighting the formation of flat nanoparticles (NPs) of 0.9 nm diameter and Pt single atoms (SAs) in the reduced state. While SAs and weakly cohesive clusters are predominantly observed in the oxide state, with a coordination sphere of Pt composed of O and Cl as revealed by EXAFS, the ratio between SAs and Pt NPs in the reduced state is found to be about 2.8. This ratio is the same for the two metal loadings: both the total numbers of NPs and SAs increase at a higher metal loading. Electron tomography reveals that the vast majority of NPs are located on the edges or defects (steps, kinks) of the.-alumina support crystallites. DFT calculations further highlight the optimized structures of NPs located at the gamma-Al2O3 (110)-(100) edge and near-edge with a stability competing with NPs located either on the (110) or on the (100) gamma-Al2O3 facet. A mathematical analysis of the segmented volumes shows that the average geodesic distances between NPs is linked to Pt loading: 9 nm for 1 wt % Pt and 16 nm for 0.3 wt % Pt. Evaluation of support tortuosity descriptors using the nanoparticle positions confirms a uniform distribution on the support. A square network geometric model compatible with the geodesic distances between NPs reveals that one to five NPs can be present at the same time on each alumina crystallite depending on Pt loading.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000021

However, it is rather challenging to fabricate such particular structures that can remain intact in harsh electrochemical environments, as such Pt-based nanocatalysts are unable to simultaneously achieve both unparalleled activity and robust stability. Here, a facile surface engineering strategy is proposed and employed to atomically tailor the near-surface structure of the Pt1.5Ni octahedra. The engineered Pt-Ni octahedra consist of an ultrathin Pt-rich shell (similar to two atomic layers) and Pt-rich bulk composition. The optimized octahedral catalyst exhibits superior specific and mass activity (7.7 mA/cm(2) Pt and 1.9 A/mg Pt at 0.9 V) for ORR, similar to 20 and similar to 10 times higher than commercial Pt/C, respectively. The ligand and strain effects arising from the near-surface engineering are unraveled to be responsible for the remarkable ORR activity. Moreover, it shows robust stability with just 9.2% decay in mass activity after accelerated degradation tests (ADTs), as its compositional nature prevents surface Pt atoms and interior Ni atoms from diffusion and dissolution, compared with a decrease of 33% for commercial Pt/C. Our atomical engineered surface strategy illustrates a facile and effective design for a class of Pt-based nanocatalysts with excellent activity and stability.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000022

Here we present an integrated experimental and theoretical study that reveals how the addition of small amounts of atomically dispersed Pt at the metal/oxide interface dramatically enhances the reducibility of a Cu2O thin film by H-2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results reveal that, upon oxidation, a PtCu single-atom alloy (SAA) surface is covered by a thin Cu2O film and is, therefore, unable to dissociate H-2. Despite this, in situ studies using ambient-pressure (AP) XPS reveal that the presence of a small amount of Pt under the oxide layer can, at the single-atom limit, promote the reduction of Cu2O by H-2 at room temperature. We built two density functional theory based surface models to better understand these experimental findings: a Cu2O/Cu(111)-like surface oxide layer, known as the "29" oxide, in which Pt is alloyed into the Cu(111) surface, as well as a PtCu SAA. Our calculations suggest that the increased activity is due to the presence of atomically dispersed Pt under the surface oxide layer, which weakens the Cu-O bonds in its immediate vicinity, thus making the interface between subsurface Pt and the surface oxide a nucleation site for the formation of metallic Cu. This initial step in the reduction process results in the presence of surface Pt atoms surrounded by metallic Cu patches, and the Pt atoms become active in H-2 dissociation, which consequently accelerates the reduction of the oxide layer. This work demonstrates how isolated Pt atoms at the metal/oxide interface of a Cu-based catalyst accelerate the reduction of the oxide and, therefore, help maintain the active, reduced state of the catalyst under the reaction conditions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000023		
J	Bugnola, Marco; Shen, Kaiji; Haviv, Eynat; Neumann, Ronny								Reductive Electrochemical Activation of Molecular Oxygen Catalyzed by an Iron-Tungstate Oxide Capsule: Reactivity Studies Consistent with Compound I Type Oxidants								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4227	4237		10.1021/acscatal.0c00897				APR 3 2020	2020	The reductive activation of molecular oxygen catalyzed by iron-based enzymes toward its use as an oxygen donor is paradigmatic for oxygen transfer reactions in nature. Mechanistic studies on these enzymes and related biomimetic coordination compounds designed to form reactive intermediates, almost invariably using various "shunt" pathways, have shown that high-valent Fe(V)=O and the formally isoelectronic Fe(IV)=O porphyrin cation radical intermediates are often thought to be the active species in alkane and arene hydroxylation and alkene epoxidation reactions. Although this four decade long research effort has yielded a massive amount of spectroscopic data, reactivity studies, and a detailed, but still incomplete, mechanistic understanding, the actual reductive activation of molecular oxygen coupled with efficient catalytic transformations has rarely been experimentally studied. Recently, we found that a completely inorganic iron-tungsten oxide capsule with a keplerate structure, noted as {Fe30W72}, is an effective electrocatalyst for the cathodic activation of molecular oxygen in water leading to the oxidation of light alkanes and alkenes. The present report deals with extensive reactivity studies of these {Fe30W72} electrocatalytic reactions showing (1) arene hydroxylation including kinetic isotope effects and migration of the ipso substituent to the adjacent carbon atom ("NIH shift"); (2) a high kinetic isotope effect for alkyl C.H bond activation; (3) dealkylation of alkylamines and alkylsulfides; (4) desaturation reactions; (5) retention of stereochemistry in cis-alkene epoxidation; and (6) unusual regioselectivity in the oxidation of cyclic and acyclic ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids where reactivity is not correlated to the bond disassociation energy; the regioselectivity obtained is attributable to polar effects and/or entropic contributions. Collectively these results also support the conclusion that the active intermediate species formed in the catalytic cycle is consistent with a compound I type oxidant. The activity of {Fe30W72} in cathodic aerobic oxidation reactions shows it to be an inorganic functional analogue of iron-based monooxygenases.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000024

Of these cocatalysts, the combination of palladium and tin showed the highest synergistic behavior and peak hydrogen gas production at a low relative fraction of palladium. The resulting palladium/tin bimetallic cocatalysts were characterized, and specifically, and scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated that palladium and tin elements reside within the same particle. The experimental catalytic activity for the palladium/tin mixture was compared to density functional theory-derived energy values associated with the adsorption of hydrogen onto a surface. This comparison demonstrated that the typical peak found in electrochemical Sabatier volcano plots at Delta G(H)* = similar to 0 eV were replicated in the experimental photocatalytic system with a peak activity observed at Delta G(H)* = -0.036 eV. Computational confirmation of the results expressed here demonstrates the efficacy of colorimetric detection of hydrogen in parallel and presents a model for increasingly rapid catalyst screening.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000026

P450s tailoring natural product could further oxidize the hydroxyl to carboxylic acid. However, heterogeneously expressed plant P450s display poor chemo- and regioselectivity in microbes, restricting the efficient biosynthesis of related natural products. CYP72A63 is a P450 enzyme previously used for the biosynthesis of glycyrrhetinic acid, and its poor selectivity resulted in oxidation of 11-oxo-beta-amyrin to a mixture of rare licorice triterpenoids (glycyrrhetol, glycyrrhetaldehyde, glycyrrhetinic acid, and 29-OH-11-oxo-beta-amyrin). In this study, we have identified key residues, which influence the enzyme-substrate hydrophobic interaction, in controlling the chemo- and regioselectivity of the enzyme and engineered the enzyme toward selectivity oxidation to hydroxyl and carboxylic acid. Moreover, tuning the redox partner of the P450 leads to selective production of glycyrrhetaldehyde, a good starting point for further modification. In this study, controlling the catalytic property of plant P450s prove to be of great use in the synthesis of desired licorice triterpenoids, which can be used in biosynthesis of other terpenoid natural products.									16	6	0	0	10	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000027

Herein, we describe that nickel phosphide nanoparticles (Ni2P NPs) act as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the selective transformation of biofuranic aldehydes into diketones, which is a useful biorefining technology. The biofuranic aldehydes are hydrogenated in water without any additives, giving the corresponding diketones in high yields. The catalytic performance of Ni2P NPs demonstrated here is significantly different from conventional Ni(0) and NiO NPs, and other metal phosphide NPs, which show no activity, indicating the unique catalysis of Ni2P NPs. Spectroscopic analyses showed that bifunctional Ni2P NP catalysis combining their hydrogen-activating ability and surface acidity plays a crucial role, leading to the transformations of selective biofuranic aldehydes.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000028

However, catalysts with a high degree of structural heterogeneity, such as commercial TiO2 powders, are not well-suited to establish rigorous structure-function relationships at an atomic level. Here, we provide compelling evidence for the effects of surface orientation of TiO2 catalyst on elimination reactions of alcohols. Two anatase titania model catalysts, with preferential exposure of (101) and (001) facets, were synthesized and studied for 2-propanol dehydration using kinetic, isotopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic measurements, coupled with DFT calculations. Surface Lewis acid sites were found to be active for 2-propanol dehydration, and (101) facets are more reactive than (001) facets under the reaction conditions studied. On both anatase surfaces, 2-propanol was found to dehydrate via concerted E2 elimination pathways, but with different initial states and thus also different intrinsic activation barriers. Molecular 2-propanol dehydration dominates on TiO2 (101) while on TiO2 (001), 2-propanol simultaneously converts to more stable 2-propoxide before dehydration, which then requires higher activation energies for E2 elimination.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000029

Under standard peptide coupling/deprotection conditions, the tBu-nic-equipped amino acid amides proved to be fully inert, allowing them to be easily built-in in complex molecules.

Herein, we report preparation of Pd(111) nanosheets (NS) onto carbon-supported WNi substrates using CO as a reducing and capping agent. Such PdNS/WNi layers can significantly enhance the ORR performance of a PdNS/WNi/C catalyst in alkaline and a PtML/PdNS/WNi/C catalyst in acidic media. The dominating Pd(111) facets and consequently diminished low-coordination sites enhanced their electrocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the inhibition of Pd-O formation bonds even at 1.1 V due to the presence of WNi/C substrates and additional shape-induced contraction caused by the slight Pd dissolution at the side edges resulted in the improvement in durability. Furthermore, the stability of the carbon supports was improved because of the protection from the well-covered WNi substrates.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000031

The formed cycloalkenes including cyclopentene and cyclohexene in the MTO reaction show high reactivity toward formation of aromatics. Cyclohexene tends to form cyclopentene through ring contraction, and the subsequent ring expansion leads to the production of aromatics. The ring-contraction/expansion process of cyclohexene is consistent with the C-13 isotopic scrambling in aromatics. Solid-state NMR experiments evidenced the formation of cyclopentenyl cations and benzenium ions intermediates in the aromatization of C6 cycloalkenes. A plausible route to link the alkene-based and aromatic-based cycles in the MTO reaction on ZSM-5 zeolite was proposed, which is corroborated by DFT calculations.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000032

Mechanistic Characterization of the Fusicoccane-type Diterpene Synthase for Myrothec-15(17)-en-7-ol								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4306	4312		10.1021/acscatal.0c00377				APR 3 2020	2020	Fusicoccane (FC)-type diterpenes, featuring a common 5-8-5 tricyclic skeleton, possess diverse biological functions. Currently, only FC-type diterpene synthases (DTSs) for 3 of the 16 possible stereochemically distinct subtypes of the FC skeleton have been discovered. Herein, a (2si,6si,10re,14si)-FC-type DTS from Myrothecium gramineum is reported, which produces the diterpene alcohol myrothec-15(17)-en-7-ol. On the basis of homology modelings, the I189F variant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis that prevents the penultimate carbocation from water attack, resulting in the deprotonation product myrotheca-7,15(17)-diene. Vibrational circular dichroism calculations in combination with chemical correlations through an enantioselective labeling strategy established the absolute configurations of these diterpenes. Density functional theory calculations revealed a water-mediated proton transfer mechanism, which is supported by isotope labeling experiments, in contrast to the deprotonation/reprotonation mechanism reported in previous studies.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000033

This O* mechanism predicted reasonable ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of Co/N/C but abnormally underestimated the one of Fe/N/C. Herein, we highlight an unconventional 2OH* ORR mechanism (O-2 -> OOH* -> 2OH* -> OH* -> H2O), which was often ignored because the free energies (Delta G) of 2OH* and O* are equal, according to the famous scaling relation: 2 Delta G(OH*) = Delta G(O*). This scaling relation is true for traditional catalysts with near-continuous active sites. We find a different scaling relation: Delta G(2OH*) = Delta G(O*) + 1.5 eV on single-atom catalysts (Me/N/C, Me = Fe, Co, etc.) and suggest that the 2OH* mechanism should not be overlooked. In consideration of both O* and 2OH* mechanisms, the ORR E-1/2 values of Co/N/C and Fe/N/C are in good agreement with experimental results. This work reveals the structure dependence of ORR reaction mechanisms and scaling relations in single-atom catalysis, and it is also heuristic for other reactions, such as O-2 evolution and N-2 reduction on single-atom catalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000034		
J	Peters, Baron								Secondary Effectiveness Factors and Solubility Effects for Catalytic Reactions in Series								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4319	4325		10.1021/acscatal.0c00185				APR 3 2020	2020	Thiele moduli and effectiveness factors are powerful ways to account for mass transfer limitations on reactions occurring within porous catalyst particles. Effectiveness factors have been developed for numerous rate laws, geometries, and nonisothermal situations, but not for reactions in series. This manuscript develops an effectiveness factor for the second step in the A -> B -> C reaction sequence with first-order kinetics and slab geometry. The expressions are more complicated than the familiar primary effectiveness factors because the intermediate B is being generated and consumed within the catalyst particle. We illustrate the application of the secondary effectiveness factor by modeling the conversion from A to B and C for plug flow through a porous ceramic monolith catalyst. Then we modeled A -> B -> C in a slurry of catalyst flakes within a well-stirred batch reactor, including equilibrium solvent-molecular sieve partition coefficients for the A and B species. When both Thiele moduli are small and the molecular sieve adsorbs A more strongly than B, the second reaction is suppressed. This situation can give essentially 100% yield of B, even when A and B have similar reactivities within the catalyst. Our results provide a framework for predicting the effects of interior mass transfer limitations and solvent-solid phase partitioning in heterogeneously catalyzed series reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000035

In this work, we investigated the mechanism of CO2RR to CO on CoPc via experimental reaction kinetics coupled with model fitting. Unexpectedly, reactant order dependences and Tafel slopes deviate from commonly expected values and change depending on the testing conditions. For example, (1) the effect of bicarbonate deviates from power law kinetics and transitions from inhibitory to promotional with increasingly reductive potential, and (2) the CO2 order dependence deviates from unity at more-reductive potentials. We propose a kinetic model, chosen from more than 15 candidate models, that is able to quantitatively fit all of the experimental data. The model invokes (1) catalyst poisoning via bicarbonate electrosorption, (2) mixed control between concerted protonelectron transfer (CPET) and sequential electron transfer-proton transfer (ET-PT), and (3) both water and bicarbonate as kinetically relevant proton donors. The proposed model also predicts that the relative importance of the above factors changes depending on the reaction conditions, highlighting the potential downfalls of broadly applying reaction mechanisms that were inferred from kinetic data collected in a narrow range of testing conditions. This study emphasizes the importance of cohesively using kinetic data collected over a wide range of operating conditions to test and formulate kinetic models of electrocatalytic reactions.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000036

Elucidation of mechanism involving catalytic enantioselective transformation with racemic substrates is often challenging. Herein, we provide mechanistic insights derived through a comprehensive density functional theory (B3LYP-D3) investigation, on the origin of stereoinduction in a Rh-catalyzed asymmetric allylic arylation of racemic 3-chlorocyclohex-1-ene by using arylboronic acid. Energetically most preferred pathway is found to proceed through (a) a transmetalation wherein aryl group gets transferred from the boron of arylboronic acid to the Rh center of the catalyst, (b) an oxidative addition (OA) of Rh to the C-Cl bond of cyclohexenyl chloride, and (c) a reductive elimination (RE) leading to the bond formation between the Rh-bound phenyl and cyclohexenyl moiety to furnish the final arylated product. We note that each enantiomer of the substrate follows different OA modes, which is highly suggestive of a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT). Although the likelihood of DYKAT has been routinely invoked in the literature, quantitative energetic details, as well as mechanistic underpinnings such as the identity of the common intermediate, generally remain scarce. The R enantiomer of cyclohexenyl chloride is found to undergo an anti-S(N)2' OA, whereas the S enantiomer prefers an anti-S(N)2 route to the common prochiral eta(3)-Rh-pi-allyl intermediate. High enantioselectivity in the ensuing RE, favoring the S enantiomer of the product, is traced to the lower activation barrier, which, in turn, arises from the lower distortion energy in the RE transition state when the si face of Rh-bound cyclohexenyl forms the bond with the phenyl group than when the re face is involved. The mechanistic insights presented herein are expected to be valuable toward understanding the DYKAT mechanism of conversion of racemic substrates to an enantiopure product.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000038

We use a newly developed electrochemical technique to compare the performance of a range of catalysts with initial composition Pt4-xCox/C of different particle sizes at high current densities (similar to 0.65 V vs RHE) as well as the typical similar to 0.9 V vs RHE. Moving from 0.9 to 0.65 V, the current densities were found to increase by up to 80-fold for the Pt/C catalysts, with this factor decreasing as the amount of Co in the PtCo alloy increases. A kinetic model incorporating site blocking species at both high and low potentials has been used to explain this change. While the dealloyed catalysts were found to have a greater mass activity at low current densities (similar to 0.9 V vs RHE), they were no longer as active as 2.1 nm Pt particle catalyst at high current densities (similar to 0.65 V vs RHE). However, for equivalent particle sizes, the mass activity of the dealloyed Co-containing catalysts remains higher across the normal operating potentials of a fuel cell. Using this insight, we predict that at 0.65 V a catalyst composed of 3.8 nm CoPt@Pt1ML particles would give optimum mass activity performance. In addition, two peaks were observed during the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on pure Pt nanoparticles in the hydrogen adsorption region (0-0.4 V vs RHE). These peaks are associated with surface sites with different reactivities toward the ORR.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000039

The strategy has two essential components: a set of multifidelity features (e.g., composition and electronic structure) and probabilistic models with Gaussian processes trained with ab initio data for predicting activity descriptors (i.e., *O and *OH adsorption energies). By iteratively validating/refining the candidates which have theoretical overpotentials <0.5 V, albeit with large uncertainties, we attain machine learning models (RMSE < 0.5 eV) that can rapidly navigate through a chemical subspace of similar to 4000 double perovskites (AA'B2O6) and single out stable structures with promising OER activity. Our approach successfully identified several known perovskites with improved catalytic performance over the benchmark LaCoO3 along with 10 other candidates that have not been reported. Importantly, by analyzing the feature distributions of better and worse catalysts than LaCoO3, we draw molecular orbital insights into physical factors governing the OER activity.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000040

Although common Lewis acids are able to provide efficient activation, the reactions often proceed with low regio- or chemoselectivity, while high selectivity frequently requires the use of well-designed metal-ligand complexes. Here we demonstrate that simple Lewis acids including Me2AlCl, FeCl3, and SnCl4 can show remarkable selectivity in differentiating between distinct transformations of carbonyl and olefin functional groups, resulting in either carbonyl-ene or carbonyl-olefin metathesis products. Specifically, we report the development of predictive multivariate linear regression models that rely on kinetic and thermodynamic information obtained in DFT calculations to gain important insights into the complex potential energy surfaces (PES) of these competing reaction paths. The presented results further our understanding of Lewis acid reactivity and suggest that even simple Lewis acids have the potential to function as highly selective catalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000042

Previously, the position of a hydroxyl on a series of hydroxylpicolinate ligands was found to significantly influence the activity of molecular iridium catalysts in sacrificial oxidant driven water oxidation. In this study, these catalysts were tested under electrochemical conditions and benchmarked to several other known molecular iridium catalysts under the exact same conditions. This allowed us to compare these catalysts directly and observe whether structure-activity relationships would prevail under electrochemical conditions. Using both electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we found that all studied iridium complexes form an iridium deposit on the electrode with binding energies ranging from 62.4 to 62.7 eV for the major Ir 4f(7/2) species. These do not match the binding energies found for the parent complexes, which have a broader binding energy range from 61.7 to 62.7 eV and show a clear relationship to the electronegativity induced by the ligands. Moreover, all catalysts performed the electrochemical water oxidation in the same order of magnitude as the maximum currents ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 mA cm(-2) once more without clear structure-activity relationships. In addition, by employing H-1 NMR spectroscopy we found evidence for Cp* breakdown products such as acetate. Electrodeposited iridium oxide from ligand free [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) or a colloidal iridium oxide nanoparticles solution produces currents almost 2 orders of magnitude higher with a maximum current of 11 mA cm(-2). Also, this deposited material contains, apart from an Ir 4f(7/2) species at 62.4 eV, an Ir species at 63.6 eV, which is not observed for any deposit formed by the molecular complexes. Thus, the electrodeposited material of the complexes cannot be directly linked to bulk iridium oxide. Small IrOx clusters containing few Ir atoms with partially incorporated ligand residues are the most likely option for the catalytically active electrodeposit. Our results emphasize that structure-activity relationships obtained with sacrificial oxidants do not necessarily translate to electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, other factors, such as electrodeposition and catalyst degradation, play a major role in the electrochemically driven water oxidation and should thus be considered when optimizing molecular catalysts.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000043	32280560

Herein, a Co-based heterostructure consisting of cobalt (Co) and molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles in a 2D morphology is purposely designed as an OER precatalyst. At the initial stage of the OER in alkaline solution, the fast phase transition of Co metal into gamma-phase cobalt oxyhydroxide (gamma-CoOOH) in the presence of Mo2C gives rise to a Mo-enriched surface of the defective gamma-CoOOH. This significantly raises the OER kinetics and gives an almost 90% enhancement in catalytic activity per metal site. Interestingly, the phase transition to gamma-CoOOH and Mo-enriched surface reconstruction are potential-dependent and are accelerated at 1.4 V, as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy as well as ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy studies. Potential-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses and methanol oxidation experiments further confirm that the Mo enrichment into the defective CoOOH surface promotes electron flow from Mo to Co sites via the bridging oxygen, greatly benefiting the electrostatic adsorption of OH- ions and smoothing the subsequent OER steps.									45	2	0	0	2	0	46			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000044

The bifunctional GFF, serving as both the catalyst support and light absorber, is decorated with MnO2 nanofins, forming a hierarchical fin-on-fin structure. The results show that the MnO2/GFF catalyst can effectively capture and convert renewable solar energy into heat (absorption of >95%), leading to a temperature rise (55.6 degrees C) of the catalyst bed under solar irradiation (1 sun, light intensity 1000 W m(-2)). The catalyst weight (9.8 mg) used in this work was significantly lower (10-100 times lower) than that used in previous studies (usually 100-1000 mg). Introducing solar energy into the typical PPC process via solar thermal conversion significantly enhances the conversion of toluene and CO2 selectivity by 36-63%, reaching similar to 93% for toluene conversion and similar to 83% for CO2 selectivity at a specific input energy of similar to 350 J L-1, thus remarkably reducing the energy consumption of the plasma-catalytic gas cleaning process. The energy efficiency for toluene conversion in the solar-enhanced post-plasma catalytic (SEPPC) process reaches up to 12.7 g kWh(-1), similar to 57% higher than that using the PPC process without solar irradiation (8.1 g kWh(-1)), whereas the energy consumption of the SEPPC process is reduced by 35-52%. Moreover, the MnO2/GFF catalyst exhibits an excellent self-cleaning capability induced by solar irradiation, demonstrating a superior long-term catalytic stability of 72 h at 1 sun, significantly better than that reported in previous works. The prominent synergistic effect of solar irradiation and PPC with a synergistic capacity of similar to 42% can be mainly attributed to the solar-induced thermal effect on the catalyst bed, boosting ozone decomposition (an almost triple enhancement from similar to 0.18 gO(3) g(-1) h(-1) for PPC to similar to 0.52 gO(3) g(-1) h(-1) for SEPPC) to generate more oxidative species (e.g., O radicals) and enhancing the catalytic oxidation on the catalyst surfaces, as well as the self-cleaning capacity of the catalyst at elevated temperatures driven by solar irradiation. This work opens a rational route to use abundant, renewable solar power to achieve high-performance and energy-fficient removal of volatile organic compounds.									18	0	0	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000045	32296596

Multiwall carbon nanotubes of varying wettability and doped with Ru nanoparticles were tested as catalysts and stabilizers of biphasic emulsions in a batch reactor under FTS reaction conditions (H-2:CO = 4:1, 220 degrees C, 55 bar). First, in comparison to the runs conducted in pure organic solvent, both rate and selectivity increased with the addition of a second (aqueous) phase. Likewise, a large increase in reaction rate was found when a second (organic) phase was incorporated, relative to that measured in pure aqueous phase. Notably, this rate increase was more substantial when the nanotubes employed were more hydrophobic and exhibited higher oil wettability. At the same time, for a given (Ru/CNT) catalyst, the rate increased with the oil/water solvent ratio, suggesting that not only the promotion by water but also the interaction of the catalyst surface with the organic solvents at the oil/water interfaces plays a key role in enabling higher rates. Because the rate changes are not due to changes in rates of mass transfer, it is concluded that the intrinsic kinetics was enhanced. Among the possible explanations for the enhanced kinetics, we discuss here some concepts recently proposed in the literature, including the water-promotion of H-assisted CO dissociation and the disruption of dense CO surface layers by the organic solvent.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000046

Although extensive studies have been devoted to the preparation of secondary and tertiary fluorides, crucial shortcomings remain: for example, lengthy substrate synthesis, contrived installation of difficult-to-remove directing/activating units, excessive waste generation and/or limited functional group compatibility. Here, we show that readily accessible alpha-onofluoro carboxylic acids, which are conventionally difficult substrates for cross-coupling, undergo direct decarboxylative crosscoupling with sp(2-) and sp(3-)hybridized organohalides to afford a wide assortment of fluorinated products. Reactions are typically promoted by a combination of 1 mol % of an Ir-based photocatalyst and 2-15 mol % of a bipyridine-Ni complex, delivering products in up to 86% yield under blue LED light irradiation. Concise synthesis of key therapeutic candidates underscores utility, complementarity, and distinct advantages compared with existing methods. DFT calculations are used to rationalize the distinct reactivity of alpha-fluoro carboxylic acid substrates (vs nonfluorinated parent acids) under decarboxylation conditions.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000048

Given the increasing interest in metallocorroles as electrocatalysts, the current study addressed the water-oxidizing ability of mononuclear and two types of binuclear iron corroles: mu-oxo bridged and linked through beta-pyrrole C atoms. This disclosed the modulation of electronic factors for lowering the electrochemical onset potential for water oxidation by the monomeric iron corroles and the fact that the C-C-linked dimer outperforms both the monomer and the mu-oxo dimer as a WOC. Parallel investigations on the corresponding bis-cobalt dimer uncovered it to be the best catalyst not only in terms of efficacy but also with regard to the stability of the catalytically active species.

Herein, we describe the nickel-catalyzed intermolecular carbobrominations of alkynes with aryl bromides to form highly substituted and functionalized alkenyl bromides. The reductive elimination of the carbon-bromine bond from a Ni(II) species, which is usually a disfavored process, is achieved from a high-valent Ni(III) species in this reaction. This transformation not only expands the scope of transition-metal-complex-promoted bond-forming reactions but also, more particularly, accomplishes the formation of labile bonds, which is as challenging to achieve as the cleavage of inert bonds, such as C-O or C-H bonds.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500028

Despite many catalyst systems developed, the state-of-the-art solutions are still limited to special alkynes. A practical catalyst, which could be used to cross-dimerize general aryl alkynes and aliphatic alkynes, is still highly desired. Herein we present the earth-abundant Co(II)-catalyzed highly gem-selective cross-dimerization of aryl alkynes and aliphatic alkynes or gas acetylene under mild reaction conditions. Conjugated 1,3-enynes with various useful functional groups can be prepared in high yields. The application of Co(OAc)(2) and t-butyl group substituted triphos ligand is essential to distinguish the alkynes at different steps and realize the gem-selectivity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500042

The transformation relies on acylimidazoles, easy-to-prepare and flexible species derived from abundant carboxylic acids, as viable cross-coupling partners for the Ni-catalyzed acylation. Careful examination revealed a remarkable mechanism: the amide C-N bond of primary and secondary imidazolides can be activated by single-electron reduction, representing a major departure from other reported amide C-N bond activation reactions. Extensive mechanistic studies also revealed an intriguing CO-extrusion-recombination phenomenon. This cross-coupling reaction between two electrophiles features a broad substrate scope bearing a wide gamut of functionalities. The practicality of this atypical transformation was demonstrated in the syntheses of 3-furyl natural products, which are difficult to access using traditional organometallic chemistry.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500044

Efficient assembly strategies of pyridones are transition metal-catalyzed C-H annulations with alkynes. The inaccessibility and extreme lability of fluoro alkynes render any direct utilization in catalysis futile. We report a highly regioselective synthesis of 4-fluoro-2-pyridones using 1-alkynyl triazenes as a convenient fluoroalkyne surrogates. The protocol comprises an alkenyl C-H annulation with 1-alkynyl triazenes followed by a treatment with HF center dot pyridine smoothly delivering a broad range of 4-fluoro-2-pyridones in a one-pot fashion in 90 min at 23-60 degrees C. Notably, a rare Lossen rearrangement occurs during the C-H functionalization part of the transformation, allowing selective access to the less-available 4-fluoro-2-pyridone framework. Furthermore, the triazenyl intermediate was elaborated into additional fluorine-containing substituents like fluorinated alkoxy and trifluoromethyl groups.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500030

The plausible reaction mechanism involves two catalytic cycles: in the first one, silver ions regioselectively catalyze the C-C bond formal insertion reaction; in the second one, silver ions chemo- and regioselectively control the cyclization and [1,5]-shift reactions. This method not only provides convenience and applies atom economy in the synthesis of multisubstituted pyrroles but also presents an entry point for further pyrrole diversification via facile modification of resulting 4H-pyrrole products, as displayed by a short formal synthesis of the natural product lamellarin L.									19	1	0	0	5	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500024

The reactions proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to afford the corresponding [4 + 2] cycloadducts in high yields with good enantioselectivities (up to 94% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1 dr). DFT calculations demonstrated that carbonyl coordination of the chiral ligand to Cu(II) was crucial for the high stereoinduction. These CBOA ligands exhibited high catalytic efficiency in this reaction, which combined with some other salient features of structural fine tunability, chemical stability, and ready accessibility might endow more practical applications in asymmetric catalytic reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500006

Here, we describe a variation of the nucleotidylation reaction termed "catch and release" that is used by an antibiotic-modifying enzyme. Aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase 4' (ANT4') inactivates antibiotics such as kanamycin and neomycin through nucleotidylation within an active site that shares significant structural and inferred underlying catalytic similarity with human DNA polymerase beta. Here, we follow the entire nucleotidyl transfer reaction coordinate of ANT4' covalently inactivating neomycin using X-ray crystallography. These studies show that although the underlying reaction mechanism is conserved with polymerases, a short 2.35 angstrom hydrogen bond is initially formed to facilitate tight binding of the aminoglycoside substrate and is subsequently disrupted by the assembly of the catalytically active ternary complex. This enables the release of products post catalysis because of a lower free energy of the product state compared to the starting substrate complex. We propose that this "catch and release" mechanism of antibiotic turnover observed in ANT4' is a variation of nucleotidyl transfer that has been adapted for the inactivation of antibiotics.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500005

Plant glycosyltransferases, which catalyze this glycosylation reaction, play a key step in preparing structure diverse and valuable triterpene glycosides. However, this class of enzymes usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency. To address this problem, triterpene glycosyltransferase UGT74AC1 from Siraitia grosvenorii was chosen and its crystal structure was solved and employed as the molecular basis to implement directed evolution and sequence/structure-based engineering. Several resultant uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs) variants exhibit a 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency for triterpene glycosylation. Especially, one variant exhibited up to 4.17 x 10(4)-fold increase in catalytic efficiency toward mogrol and 1.53 x 10(4)-fold increase to UDP-glucose, respectively. Moreover, the mutants also displayed extended substrate promiscuity compared with wildtype enzyme and conserved regioselectivity. Based on the results of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, it was proposed that the improved enzymatic activity and substrate promiscuity were likely owing to the stable hydrophobic interactions and favorite conformations between the enzyme and substrates. This work has also laid a foundation for the engineering of other plant UGTs for their practical application to the synthesis of valuable triterpene saponins.									12	2	0	0	6	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500013

Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) is a cheap, stable, and soluble solid oxidant, holding promise for organic oxidation reactions. Herein, we report the catalytic PMS activation via carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the selective oxidation of BzOH under mild conditions without other additives. A remarkable promotion of BzH yield with a selectivity over 80% was achieved on modified CNTs, i.e., O-CNTs via the radical oxidation process, and the oxygen functionalities for catalysis were comprehensively investigated by experimental study and theoretical exploration. To understand the different surface oxygen species on CNTs for the activation of PMS, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the adsorption behavior of PMS on various CNTs. The electrophilic oxygen was identified as the electron captor to activate PMS by O-O bond cleavage to form SO5 center dot- and SO4 center dot- radicals. The nucleophilic carbonyl groups can also induce a redox cycle to generate (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- radicals, but phenolic hydroxyl groups impede the radical process with antioxidative functionality. The carbocatalysis-assisted PMS activation may provide a cheap process for the selective oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes or ketones. The insight achieved from this fundamental study may be further applied to other organic syntheses via selective oxidation.									31	1	0	0	6	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500001

Like the homogeneously catalyzed protocol, the reaction is compatible with a variety of functional groups including electron-donating and electron-withdrawing aryl and heteroaryl moieties. Moreover, this protocol allows the installation of allyl groups onto (hetero)arenes, enlarging the scope of the method. The heterogeneous mpg-CN photocatalyst is easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused several times, paving the way for larger-scale industrial applications of this type of photocatalytic bond-forming reactions.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500002

However, the development of such a process has been retarded by the lack of efficient electrocatalysts for highly selective synthesis of ammonia from nitrate electroreduction. In this work, TiO2 nanotubes with rich oxygen vacancies (TiO2-x) are reported to exhibit high Faradaic efficiency (85.0%) and selectivity (87.1%) toward the ammonium synthesis from nitrate electroreduction. N-15 isotope labeling experiments prove that ammonium originates from nitrate reduction. Both the H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and colorimetric methods are performed to quantify ammonia. Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory calculations reveal the function of oxygen vacancy in nitrate electroreduction, that is, the oxygen atom in nitrate fills in oxygen vacancies of TiO2-x to weaken the N-O bonding and restrain the formation of byproducts, resulting in high Faradaic efficiency and ammonium selectivity. This strategy may open a paradigm for the development of rationally designed nanostructures as the electrocatalysts for selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonium.									75	5	0	0	12	0	78			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500003

To enable efficient PEM-WE in acidic media, iridium (Ir)- or ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts are indispensable to drive the thermodynamically and kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, developing Ir/Ru catalysts with high efficiency and long-term durability still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of ultrafine IrRu intermetallic nanoclusters loaded on conductive, acid-stable, amorphous tellurium nanoparticle support (IrRu@Te). Benefiting from the large exposed electrocatalytically active surface of ultrafine IrRu clusters and the strong electronic coupling between IrRu and Te support, the as-obtained IrRu@Te catalysts show good catalytic performance for the OER in strong acidic electrolyte (i.e., 0.5 M H2SO4), requiring overpotentials of only 220 and 303 mV to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) and able to sustain continuous OER electrolysis up to 20 h at 10 mA cm(-2) with minimal degradation. Moreover, IrRu@Te exhibits high specific activity, illustrating intrinsically better performance compared with that of unsupported IrRu and other commercial Ir- and Ru-based catalysts. It also demonstrates unprecedentedly high mass activity of 590 A g(IrRu)(-1) at an overpotential of 270 mV, outperforming most Ir- and Ru-based OER catalysts reported in the literature. Furthermore, IrRu@Te catalysts reveal good OER performance in neutral electrolyte as well, holding great potential to be used for PEM-WE in environmentally friendly conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on oxidized IrRu confirm that the catalyst/support coupling results in a lower energy barrier for the oxygen-oxygen bonding formation, offering a rational explanation to the experimentally observed OER performance.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500008

Kinetic measurements indicated a rapid activation phase, followed by a continuous slow deactivation. A faster deactivation of CO formation (reverse water-gas shift reaction) compared to that of methanol formation results in an increasing selectivity toward MeOH formation with time on stream. The activation of the catalyst is attributed to a rapid initial reduction of the support (formation of O vacancies). Since based on STEM imaging and XRD measurements sintering of Au nanoparticles is negligible, the subsequent deactivation is attributed to the slow buildup of site-blocking adsorbates, specifically surface carbonates, and/or over-reduction of the catalyst. This is supported also by the reversible nature of the deactivation upon recalcination in O-2/N-2. Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) measurements, following the buildup/decay of adsorbed formate and methoxy species by DRIFTS upon changing from a CO2/H-2 to a CO2/D-2 mixture and back under steady-state conditions, indicate that surface formate species are reaction intermediates in the dominant reaction pathway for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, with the calculated rates of formation/decay comparable to the rate of methanol formation. The consequences of these results for the mechanistic understanding of this reaction are discussed.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500009

Moderate heat treatment of nickel(II) hydroxide (<= 700 degrees C) leads to the formation of nickel(II) oxide (nano)particles, which exhibit reduced OER activity the higher the heat treatment temperature was. In this work, we report that heat treatment of nickel(II) hydroxide in air at even higher temperatures (60 min at 900 degrees C) results in an oxide material with high OER activity superior to that of the nickel(II) hydroxide. Similarly, the stability of the nickel(II) oxide under electrochemical conditions is increased compared to nickel(II) hydroxide. Electrochemical in situ Raman measurements show the formation of surface nickel oxy-hydroxides (NiOOH) at positive potentials and are significantly affected by the initial heat treatment. From XPS, Raman, and XRD results, it is concluded that a Ni3+-enriched phase, possibly a higher-valent mixed nickel oxide, is present at the surface of the nickel(II) oxide sample treated at 900 degrees C resulting in an increased OER activity compared to NiOOH. This basic understanding of high-temperature-treated nickel oxide may contribute to resolving the present stability issues of OER electrocatalysts and may help to leverage alkaline electrolysis as important key technology for a renewable energy supply.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500010

The state-of-the-art ASC has a dual-layer architecture composed of a Pt/Al2O3 (PGM) bottom layer and a metal (Fe, Cu)-exchanged zeolite (M-Z) top layer. The PGM layer provides high NH3 oxidation activity; however, the desired N-2 product is achieved over a narrow temperature range just above light-off, whereas the reaction byproducts N2O and NOx (i.e., NO and NO2) appear at intermediate and high temperatures, respectively. An advantage of the M-Z catalyst is the selective lean reduction of NO via conversion of NH3 to N-2 over a broad temperature range. Although recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-layer design, further advances are needed to reduce the PGM loading and ASC volume while enhancing low-temperature activity. In this study, the dual-layer concept is scaled down to the level of a single core-shell (CS) catalyst particle, Pt/Al2O3@Cu/ZSM-5, composed of a PGM core and a M-Z shell, with the intent to meet the aforementioned challenges. The CS catalyst was realized by rational design of key synthesis steps, the most critical being the initial growth of an intermediate silicalite-1 layer to prevent Al leaching during the secondary growth of the ZSM-5 shell. Characterization of the CS spherical catalyst reveals a mesoporous PGM core (ca. 40 mu m diameter) that is active and a nearly dense zeolitic shell (ca. 1 mu m thick). Evaluation of the CS catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor shows excellent NH3 oxidation activity and N-2 selectivity. In addition, we obtained an unanticipated enhancement of the Pt/Al2O3 performance within the CS configuration that gives an exceptional light-off of the NH3 oxidation. Our findings reveal that the CS catalyst has an equivalent activity to that of a conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3 times higher Pt loading. Further, a dual-layer ASC composed of a bottom layer containing the seeded core Pt/Al2O3 and a Cu-SSZ-13 top layer achieves the same performance as a dual-layer ASC having 3 times higher Pt loading but with unmodified Pt/Al2O3. The enhanced activity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is attributed to a modification of the reducibility of oxides of Pt crystallites owing to the overgrowth of silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 layers in the CS configuration. Finally, the separate impacts of H2O in the feed and of hydrothermal aging (HTA) on catalyst performance are reported. H2O in the feed is shown to have a negligible impact on conversion and product distribution. The silicalite-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is more resilient to HTA treatment than conventional Pt/Al2O3.									10	1	1	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500011

First row transition metal phosphides recently emerged as excellent alternatives for hydrogen evolution and hydrotreating reactions. We demonstrate that a key member of this family, Ni2P, readily hydrogenates nitrate (NO3-) to ammonia (NH3) near ambient conditions with very high selectivity (96%). One of the few non-precious metal-based catalysts for this transformation, and among ca. 1% of catalysts with NH3 selectivity, Ni2P can be recycled multiple times with limited loss of activity. Both nitrite (NO2-) and nitric oxide (NO) intermediates are also hydrogenated. Density functional theory (DFT) indicates that.in the absence of a catalyst.nitrite hydrogenation is the reaction bottleneck. A variety of adsorbates (H, O, N, NO) induce surface reconstruction with top-layer Ni-rich surface stoichiometry. Critically, H saturation coverage on Ni2P(001) is only ca. 3 nm(-2), significantly less than that on Pd(111) and Ni(111) of ca. 15-18 nm(-2), which may play a key role in allowing coadsorption of NOx-. The ability of Earth-abundant, binary metal phosphides such as Ni2P to catalyze nitrate hydrogenation could transform and help us to better understand the basic science behind catalytic hydrogenation and, in turn, advance the next generation of oxyanion removal technologies.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500012

High reaction temperatures are always needed for heterogeneous catalysis using non-noble metals, and switching product selectivity in one catalysis system remains a great challenge. In the present study, a visible-light-driven procedure for this reaction is proposed, using oxidized TiN photocatalysts under mild conditions, whereby the product selectivity can be well-tuned. Oxidized TiN photocatalysts with tunable surface N/O ratios were successfully synthesized through the facile and flexible thermal oxidation treatment of low-cost TiN nanopowder. The alpha-alkylation of acetophenone with benzyl alcohol to form the two important compounds chalcone and dihydrochalcone occurred even at room temperature and almost complete conversion was achieved at 100 degrees C under visible light. The proportion of the two products can be well-tuned by switching the surface N/O ratio of the synthesized photocatalysts. Visible light is demonstrated to affect the surface N/O ratio of the photocatalysts and contribute to tuning the product selectivity. Light intensity and action spectrum study proves that the generation of energetic charge carriers results in the observed activities under visible light, based on interband transitions of TiN or the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect of the surface complex formed on TiO2. Thermal energy can be coupled with light energy within this photocatalytic system, which will facilitate the full use of solar energy. Different sequential reaction mechanisms on TiN and TiO2 are proposed to be responsible for the tunable product selectivity. The wide reaction scope, the fine conversion at a low light intensity, and the favorable reusability of photocatalysts prove the great application potential of this visible-light-driven procedure for the alpha-alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500014

It is still disputed whether the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) may be competitive with the conventional adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) of the OER in these materials and, if so, under what conditions. Herein, we employ density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that the LOM can give rise to higher OER activity than the AEM at the active sites involving structural defects, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Specifically, we show that, although the AEM is preferred for the perfect (110) and (211) surfaces, the formation of metal vacancies due to catalyst dissolution may lead to much lower OER overpotentials for the LOM. Also, by screening several metal impurities in RuO2, we reveal that dopants such as Ni and Co can promote the LOM over the AEM even for the perfectly structured surfaces. Overall, we demonstrate that defective IrO2 is less LOM active than RuO2 that should contribute to its superior stability under OER conditions.									59	2	0	0	3	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500015

The high overpotential, stability, and selectivity in the use of a single-metal-based catalyst still remain a challenge. In current work, instead of using pure noble metals (Ag, Au, and Pt) as the catalyst, a nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy (HEA: AuAgPtPdCu) has been used for the conversion of CO2 into gaseous hydrocarbons. Utilizing an approach of multimetallic HEA, a faradic efficiency of about 100% toward gaseous products is obtained at a low applied potential (-0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). The reason behind the catalytic activity and selectivity of the high-entropy alloy (HEA) toward CO2 electroreduction was established through first-principles-based density functional theory (DFT) by comparing it with the pristine Cu(111) surface. This is attributed to the reversal in adsorption trends for two out of the total eight intermediates-*OCH3 and *O on Cu(111) and HEA surfaces.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500016

It proceeds under mild reaction conditions in a step-economy process by simultaneously cleaving the C C bonds and constructing C-C bonds. Depending on the substitution of the ynones, the reactions can proceed efficiently to generate synthetically useful 1,4-ketoaldehydes and cyclopentenone compounds. A plausible pathway is proposed that involves an active cyclopropane intermediate that consequently undergoes a cascade ring-opening reaction. The method works for a spectrum of ynones and N-tosylhydrazones that give good to excellent yields using a cheap copper catalytic system.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500017

A variety of reactive functional groups are tolerated in the pyridine 3-position, and sufficient catalytic activity was obtained for reduction of sterically hindered cases such as 3,5-disubstituted pyridines and even 4-substituted pyridines. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the superior catalytic activity and 1,4-regioselectivity of the Cu/Fe heterobinuclear catalyst, compared to the corresponding mononuclear Cu catalyst, is derived from biphilic cooperativity of two key catalytic intermediates: electrophilic CpFe(CO)(2)(Bpin) activates the pyridine substrates toward regioselective nucleophilic addition by (IPr)CuH.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500018

The hydrolysis of these substrates is studied by comparing stepwise, concerted, and substrate-assisted mechanisms. Both the stepwise and concerted mechanisms occur with similar barriers, while the energetics for the substrate-assisted mechanism are significantly less favorable. Irrespective of the mechanism, active site residue His217 plays a critical role, in agreement with structural, kinetics, and spectroscopic data, but the transition state of the reaction depends on the identity of the substrate (dissociative for the triester paraoxon, associative for the monoester 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP), and in-between for the diesters glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine (GPE) and bis(4-nitrophenyl)phosphate (BNPP)). In good agreement with available kinetic and spectrophotometric data, the calculations highlight the preference of GpdQ for diester substrates, followed by tri- and monoesters. For substrates with two different types of scissile bonds (paraoxon and GPE) a clear preference for the bond with the stronger electron withdrawing leaving group was observed. The extensive agreement between experimental data and DFT calculations enhances the understanding of the mechanism of GpdQ-catalyzed hydrolysis and paves the way for the rational design of optimized catalysts for the hydrolysis of different types of phosphoesters.									5	0	1	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500020

However, the photocatalytic H2O2 generation activity of the pristine C3N4 in pure H2O is poor due to unpropitious rapid charge recombination and unfavorable selectivity. Herein, we report a facile method to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 production by grafting cationic polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules onto C3N4. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate PEI can tune the local electronic environment of C3N4. The unique intermolecular electronic interaction in PEI/C3N4 not only improves the electron-hole separation but also promotes the two-electron O-2 reduction to H2O2 via the sequential two-step single-electron reduction route. With the synergy of improved charge separation and high selectivity of two-electron O-2 reduction, PEI/C3N4 exhibits an unexpectedly high H2O2 generation activity of 208.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 25-fold higher than that of pristine C3N4. This study establishes a paradigm of tuning the electronic property of C3N4 via functional molecules for boosted photocatalysis activity and selectivity.									52	2	0	0	3	0	53			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500021

The oxygen mobility in the perovskites described by the formation energy of oxygen vacancy is found to have a pronounced effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity. In particular, the selectivity is controlled largely by the surface oxygen concentration or the oxygen vacancy concentration on perovskites, which depends strongly on the bulk oxygen concentration and the relative rate of the lattice oxygen diffusion with respect to the surface reaction. The substitution of Sr for La at the A site and the substitution of Co for Fe at the B site of the ABO(3) perovskites dramatically increase the oxygen mobility. A higher oxygen diffusion rate, and hence enrichment of oxygen on the surface, would improve the catalyst selectivity toward total oxidation.									26	2	0	0	2	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500022

Herein, a series of Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) containing various types of metal node to ligand coordinations were synthesized and tested for CTH of furfural (FUR) to furfuryl alcohol (FOL). It was found that metal node coordination plays a more important role than porosity in Zr-MOFs. MOF-808 (synthesized using a scaled-up approach to achieve a higher batch yield), with the lowest metal node to ligand coordination (coordination number 6), was found to be the most active catalyst among the various tested Zr-MOFs. Furthermore, M-MOF-808, modified by simple methanol activation (M), outperformed the pristine MOF-808 in CTH of FUR to FOL even at 30 degrees C in the presence of 2-propanol (IPA) as the hydrogen source. The simple modification of the metal node in the Zr-MOF changed the acid-base properties of the MOF-808 surface through the development of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS), hydroxyl and methoxy groups in the framework of the Zr-MOF, which probably help to facilitate the adsorption of FUR and IPA onto the metal node surfaces of the catalyst. To evaluate the versatility of methanol activation in CTH, further substrates, including other types of biomass and representative carbonyl compounds over M-MOF-808, were tested. To demonstrate heterogeneous catalysis, the catalyst was recycled for five consecutive cycles, with little loss after the first cycle, and was fully characterized to observe any changes in its structure. Mechanistic insights were provided by isotopically labeled 2-propanol-d(8) experiments, indicating FUR reduction through transfer hydrogenation. Finally, the reaction mechanism for CTH of FUR to FOL was proposed in detail using density functional theory (DFT) calculations over metal node modified model systems of a 6-connected Zr-MOF.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500023

However, it remains a challenge to effectively regulate the selectivity toward single ethylene or propylene due to the limited catalyst selection and insufficient understanding of the selectivity control principle. Herein, we report the synthesis of a small-pore SAPO-14 molecular sieve (AFN topology) with an ultra-small cage structure and a narrow 8-membered ring (8-MR) channel system, over which the propylene selectivity can rise to as high as 77.3%, representing the highest record of one-pass propylene selectivity in the MTO reaction. The influence of reaction conditions on the catalytic performance was investigated, and the olefin formation mechanism was revealed by combining the analyses of C-12/C-13-methanol isotopic switch experiments, confined organics analysis, and reaction-diffusion simulations. This work provides a possibility to subtly control the MTO product distribution by the design and synthesis of the molecular sieve catalyst.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500025

ACS CATALYSIS				10	6			3750	3763		10.1021/acscatal.0c00399				MAR 20 2020	2020	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of catalyst materials that present the opportunity to develop Lewis acid catalysts with uniform, well-defined, tunable, isolated active sites for a range of chemical transformations. A common example of such a transformation is the acetalization of carbonylic compounds with alcohols over MIL-100. Despite numerous reports focused on the acetalization performance of MIL-100 and related MOF materials, the identity of MIL-100 active sites still remains a point of contention. We present herein a range of catalytic, in situ titration and spectroscopy data that can all plausibly be interpreted under the assumption of the near-exclusive contribution of Bronsted acid sites toward effecting acetalization turnovers over MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-100(Fe). Thermal treatment protocols that simultaneously increase Lewis acid site density and decrease Bronsted acid site density can be used to eliminate more than 90% of MIL-100 mediated turnovers, and infrared spectroscopic signatures indicating the coordination of pyridine to acid sites upon sequential introduction of 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DTBP) followed by pyridine, but not vice versa, are consistent with an attribution of the genesis of Bronsted acid sites to water ligation to open-metal sites. Correlations between MIL-100 degree of hydration, Bronsted acid site density, and net turnover numbers suggest that the involvement of Lewis acid sites, if any, remain minor under the experimental conditions used in this study. Lastly, a decreasing fraction of sites left unititrated by DTBP with lightening diffusion restrictions around the oxo centered trimer indicate that untitrated sites reflect limited access of sterically hindered DTBP, rather than contributions from Lewis acid sites. The principles and methodology used in this study are broadly applicable within the domain of MOF-mediated catalysis, and reinforce the need for a careful evaluation of active site speciation under reaction conditions to more fully realize the promise of MOF materials as Lewis acid catalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500026

Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 9238). Direct calculations of redox potentials (E-0), acidity constants (pK(a)), and free energies of activation (Delta G(double dagger)) by density functional theory (DFT) with the help of high-level ab initio calculations predict that hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) thermodynamically and kinetically favors a Re-hydride/monothiol intermediate, while the hydrogen evolving reaction (HER) favors Re-dihydride intermediates, in contrast to the Re-dithiols as proposed previously. The catalytic pathway for HOR involves two oxidation steps from [ReL3] to [ReL3](2+), followed by H-2 addition to form the Re-hydride/thiol, [(ReH)(S1H)L-2](2+). Under basic conditions, deprotonation of this complex produces [Re(S1H)L-2](+) with the thiol as S1, rather than the proposed S3. Further deprotonation of [Re(S1H)L-2](+) closes the catalytic cycle to regenerate [ReL3]. For the HER, DFT calculations predict that [ReL3] is reduced to [ReL3](-), followed by protonation of [ReL3](-) at the Re center to produce metal-protonated [(ReH)L-3] in accordance with the E-0 = -1.45/-1.60 V (cal./exp.). The E-0 calculations suggest a reassignment of the experimentally observed peak at -1.70 V to the singly protonated E([ReL3 center dot H](0/-)) rather than the doubly protonated E([ReL3 center dot H-2](+/0)). This reassignment and the low relative pK(a)'s of [ReL3 center dot H-2](+) illustrate that addition of the second proton must follow the second electrochemical reduction of [(ReH)L-3] to [(ReH)L-3](-), which is basic enough to be protonated at the Re center making the formation of the Re-dihydride [(HReH)L-3]. Production of H-2 occurs via reductive elimination through a Re-H-2 adduct. The nature of the key intermediates from the DFT calculations is confirmed by the complete active space calculations (CASSCF). This comprehensive investigation into the HOR and HER mechanisms can guide further experimental and theoretical efforts on rationally designing the effective electrocatalysts by comparing how various ligand modifications may shift the mechanistic steps.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500029

However, the interaction role between two active species and reaction paths are still unclear. We report here that a high yield of aromatics was achieved by serial reactions directly from syngas on a Na-Fe-ZrO2/ZSM-5 tandem catalyst. Results point out significant impacts of zeolite in the catalytic system on performance including activity and selectivity. The role of the zeolite on reaction pathways about both CO conversion and aromatic formation has been systematically investigated by steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis and designed experiments. The presence of zeolite in the catalytic system promotes the CO hydrogenation rate by means of improving the iron carburization degree, possibly because of the enhanced CO adsorption and the formation of surface intermediates. It also enhances selectivity to aromatics by coupling CO to participate in the olefin transformation on ZSM-5. In addition, the formation rate of aromatics is proportional to the number of Lewis acidic sites, suggesting the dehydroaromatization route as the main mechanism of olefin aromatization. These findings provide some insights into the effect of ZSM-5 on reaction paths over the FTS catalyst-zeolite tandem catalyst system.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500031

The CAZy classification further assigns these enzymes into sequence-based families sharing a common stereochemistry for substrates (either alpha- or beta-) and products (i.e., inverting or retaining mechanism). Here we describe the N-acetylgalactosaminidases AmGH109A and AmGH109B (i.e., GH109: glycoside hydrolase family 109) from the human gut symbiont Akkermansia muciniphila. Notably, AmGH109A displays alpha-retaining and beta-inverting N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities with comparable efficiencies on natural disaccharides. This dual specificity could provide an advantage in targeting a broader range of host-derived glycans. We rationalize this discovery through bioinformatics, structural, mutational, and computational studies, unveiling a histidine residing in a conserved GGHGG motif as the elusive catalytic acid-base of the GH109 family.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500033

Our computational mechanistic investigations revealed that branched and linear hydroboration products are formed via mechanisms that involve the migratory insertions of styrene into Rh-H and Rh-B bonds, respectively. Such reaction mechanisms are fundamentally different from those calculated for hydroborations catalyzed by Rh-phosphine complexes in which the styrene prefers to insert into the Rh-H bond regardless if the linear or branched product is formed. The calculated steric and electronic effects exhibited by the NHC ligands on the corresponding reaction rates and regioselective outcomes revealed that stronger electron-donor ligands promote reactivity, and the steric bulk of the NHC ligands effectively controll the regioselectivity of the hydroboration reaction. Generally, bulkier NHC ligands favor the formation of linear products and less sterically demanding NHC ligands favor the formation of branched products.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500034

A variety of pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles were constructed by a simple, green, and mild path.

However, the commonly used Pt/carbon nanotubes (Pt/CNT) catalysts suffer from the severe deactivation, because of the strong adsorption of glyceric acid (GLYA), resulting in the serious Pt-surface poisoning and their consequent poor activity with low selectivity toward GLYA. Here, we demonstrate that integrating CeO2 with Pt/CNT could effectively alleviate the catalyst deactivation, delivering high activity and selectivity to produce GLYA. The valence band analysis and kinetic experiments suggest that the Pt-CeO2/CNT ternary interface would weaken the GLYA adsorption on Pt and lower the energy barrier for glycerol oxidation. Moreover, via the generated OH* from H2O dissociation, CeO2 can promote the oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups of glycerol, leading to a high selectivity of GLYA.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500036

Addition of [(NBu4)-Bu-n][OH] immediately terminates metathesis via HII, an effect traced to formation of bis(hydroxide) complex HII-OH. The latter was synthesized for direct study. HII-OH initiates very slowly on reaction with olefins, and decomposes in the first cycle of metathesis. Computational analysis reveals rapid bimolecular coupling between HII-OH and its four-coordinate methylidene derivative. Importantly, fully decomposed catalyst also accelerates decomposition of HII-OH. The H-bonding capacity of the hydroxide ligand is proposed as a powerful driving force for degradation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500037

In particular, formate dehydrogenases are of great interest since they reduce CO2 to formate, a valuable chemical fuel and hydrogen storage compound. The metal-dependent formate dehydrogenases of prokaryotes can show high activity for CO2 reduction. Here, we report an expression system to produce recombinant W/Sec-FdhAB from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hilden-borough fully loaded with cofactors, its catalytic characterization and crystal structures in oxidized and reduced states. The enzyme has very high activity for CO2 reduction and displays remarkable oxygen stability. The crystal structure of the formate-reduced enzyme shows Sec still coordinating the tungsten, supporting a mechanism of stable metal coordination during catalysis. Comparison of the oxidized and reduced structures shows significant changes close to the active site. The DvFdhAB is an excellent model for studying catalytic CO2 reduction and probing the mechanism of this conversion.									11	1	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500038

It can be found that S doping could stabilize the reductive-state Cu as the active site for CO2R. The vibration models of CO2- intermediates within in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that the selectivity improvement is ascribed to the change of the adsorption state from coexisting O*CO- and OC*O*(-) to the dominating OC*O*(-).

The state-of-art synthesis of imines via condensation of amines with aldehydes or ketones often uses homogeneous catalysts and dehydrating agents to promote the elimination of water, which requires huge manpower input for the late-stage purification process and is usually environmentally unfriendly. Photocatalytic synthesis of imines from amines oxidation via the release of hydrogen (H-2) is of great promise due to the mild reaction characteristics; however, the efficiency of such a reaction lags due to the missing designed photocatalyst owing to the ambiguous reaction mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that by constructing in situ photoimmobilized Ni clusters on the CdS photocatalyst, the generation of imines is dramatically improved with the rapid release of molecular H-2 under visible light illumination. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the adsorption of photogenerated hydrogen atoms during the dehydrogenation of amines is significantly weakened on Ni clusters, thus resulting in fast C-N coupling kinetics for the generation of imines. The photocatalyst presents stable performance with high efficiency. A remarkably apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of similar to 44% is realized under 420 nm irradiation for the conversion of 4-methoxybenzylamine within six consecutive runs. Furthermore, a series of primary and secondary amines bearing different functional groups (i.e., heterocyclic, aliphatic, N-heterocycles) that are synthetically challenging by the condensation process can be selectively converted to the corresponding imines, featuring its application prospect.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500045

However, current numerical methods consider individual and often geometrical closed-shell nanoparticles, neglecting how the coexistence of several and structurally diverse isomers in a sample affect the activity of the latter. Here, we present a multiscale numerical approach to calculate, in a fast and high-throughput fashion, the current density and mass activity of individual isomers, as well as predict the activity of morphologically diverse but size-selected samples. We propose specific design rules of platinum nanosamples for the electrochemical reduction of molecular oxygen, identifying the size range up to 5.5 nm as the one where isomerization of individual nanoparticles and the morphological composition of the sample cannot be neglected. We confirm a peak of the activity of defected and concave polyhedra at 2-3 nm while spherical but amorphous isomers become the most active in the range of 3-5 nm, with an astonishing mass activity of 2.7 A/mg.

Up to now, the catalysts for this purpose are largely developed based on trial and error. In this work, we demonstrate that a careful analysis of the formic acid dehydrogenation mechanism can shed light on rational design and facile synthesis of efficient Pd-based catalysts, that is, carbon black-supported fine Pd nanoparticles with adatoms of an sp metal (including but not limited to Bi). In fact, Pd@Bi/C with an optimal atomic ratio doubles the Pd mass activity of the Pd/C in terms of hydrogen production rate, specifically with a global turnover frequency of 4350 h(-1) at 303 K in a mixed 1.1 M formic acid and 2.4 M sodium formate solution without engineering the catalyst support. Apparent kinetic measurement, in situ interfacial IR spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation results further confirm that Bi adatoms favor the adsorption of the formate intermediate to facilitate the C-H bond cleavage and weaken the adsorption of H and CO on Pd sites, resulting in a prominently enhanced H-2 production performance.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500047

In situ quick extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy showed that Pd remains stable and nonreducible in the flowing ethanol/water solvent mixture under heating to 353 K. However, ex situ transmission electron microscopy, high-energy X-ray diffraction, and fluorescence yield Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure show that the addition of a significant amount of base (K2CO3, 0.1 M) results in the structural degradation of the perovskite support as well as the mobilization of Pd along the sample bed that is dependent on the structure and crystallite size of the perovskite. The results are discussed in terms of the use of perovskite-type oxides in various areas of research where they are placed in contact with liquid phases of variable temperature and elevated pH.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500048

The modifiers typically stereodirect prochiral reactants on the metal surface through the formation of diastereomeric complexes. Surface science measurements on model systems show several examples where such complexes display multiple abundant binding configurations. Insights into the factors determining the relative populations of complexation states can be potentially gained from comparing slightly variant chiral modifiers. Here, we compare scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for chirality transfer complexes formed by (R)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine and (R)-1-(8-methyl-1-naphthyl)ethylamine coadsorbed with the prochiral substrate 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone in order to probe for changes induced by the methyl substituent. The comparison shows changes in relative abundances beyond those predicted by only direct steric interaction. Density functional theory (DFT) methods are used to calculate complexation energies. A number of rationalizations are proposed for the experimentally determined differences in relative abundances and also for differences between DFT-predicted and STM-measured populations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300015

The exact role of the catalytic resting state of the homo-biaryl-Pd(II) complex, which was previously overlooked in Pd/Ag dual-catalyzed CDC, was carefully investigated. Detailed experimental studies indicated that a homo-biaryl-Pd(II) complex occurred in the catalytic off-cycle as a resting state and prevented the homocoupling of perfluoroarenes. In addition, these studies indicated that the C-H bond activation steps of perfluoroarenes and thiophenes proceeded by different mechanisms. While the C-H bond of perfluoroarenes was immediately activated by Ag(I) salts, the C-H bond of thiophenes was activated by the Pd(II) catalyst. Kinetic studies revealed that the Pd(II)-C-H activation of thiophenes is most likely the rate-determining step.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300050

These catalysts are also active for the reverse reaction, i.e., the decomposition of formic acid to H-2 and CO2. While numerous catalysts have been synthesized for reactions in both directions, the factors controlling the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle remain poorly understood. In this work, we synthesize a series of compounds of type H4Ru(P(C6H4R)(3))(3) containing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups and analyze their influence on the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of CO2 insertion and deinsertion. The data are correlated with the catalytic performance of the complexes through linear free-energy relationships. The results show that formic acid dissociation from the catalyst is rate-determining during CO2 hydrogenation, while deinsertion is critical for the decomposition reaction.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300010

Although the borylation of aryl C-H bonds can be catalyzed by iridium complexes containing phen or bpy ligands at mild temperatures and with limiting arene, the borylation of alkyl C-H bonds remains underdeveloped. We prepared a library of phenanthrolines that contain varying substitution patterns. The corresponding phen-Ir trisboryl carbon monoxide complexes were synthesized to determine the electron-donating ability of these ligands, and the initial rates for the borylation of the C-H bonds in THE and diethoxyethane beta to oxygen catalyzed by Ir complexes containing these ligands were measured. For some subsets of these ligands, the donor ability correlated positively with the rate of C-H borylation catalyzed by the complexes containing ligands within a given subset. However, across subsets, ligands possessing similar donor properties to one another form catalysts for the borylation of alkyl C-H bonds with widely varying activity. This phenomenon was investigated computationally, and it was discovered that the stabilizing interactions between the phenanthroline ligand and the boryl ligands attached to Ir in the transition state for C-H oxidative addition could account for the differences in the activity of the catalysts that possess similar electron densities at Ir. The effect of these interactions on the borylation of secondary alkyl C-H bonds is larger than it is on the borylation of primary alkyl C-H bonds.									18	1	1	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300053	33178481

Here, we report a successful protocol toward addressing this issue via an organocatalyzed cascade annulation. The protocol could afford 11 classes of enantioenriched alpha-functionalized ketones using a single catalytic system and avoid the frequent alterations of reaction conditions used in conventional methods. Up to 684 of the selectivity factor (s) is observed, and in most case, the s values are higher than 100. An aminolactam additive proves essential in promoting the resolution efficiency. Moreover, many previously unavailable enantiopure alpha-functionalized ketones are now accessible, and the annulation products are also useful building blocks and can be further transferred to densely substituted ketones without erosion of the optical purity. Mechanistically, in sharp contrast to the currently used direct one-step resolution patterns, a two-key-step resolution mode, wherein the enantiomer discrimination happens at the second aldol step and the enatioenriched ketones are recovered by the reversible initial Michael reaction, is proposed, which provides opportunities addressing the challenging tasks that could not be solved by conventional resolution techniques.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300001

Given their importance, methods that directly functionalize aza-cycles are in high demand. Herein, we disclose a fundamentally different approach to functionalizing cyclic amines which relies on C-C cleavage and attendant cross-coupling. The initial functionalization step is the generation of underexplored N-fused bicyclo alpha-hydroxy-beta-lactams under mild, visible light conditions using a Norrish-Yang process to affect alpha-functionalization of saturated cyclic amines. This approach is complementary to previous methods for the C-H functionalization of aza-cycles and provides unique access to various cross-coupling adducts. In the course of these studies, we have also uncovered an orthogonal, base-promoted opening of the N-fused bicyclo alpha-hydroxy-beta-lactams. Computational studies have provided insight into the origin of the complementary C-C cleavage processes.									26	0	0	0	10	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300005	33569242

Upon introduction to the environment, it is a pervasive groundwater pollutant that poses remediation challenges. There remain few homogeneous systems capable of deoxygenating perchlorate to chloride, and the reported catalysts suffer from deactivation as the concentration of chloride increases during catalysis. This report improves the turnover number of perchlorate reduction by an iron catalyst containing a secondary coordination sphere by an order of magnitude. The use of a zinc reagent mitigates chloride inhibition and promotes catalyst turnover. Additionally, the initial rate of perchlorate reduction was examined using time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy, furnishing insights into the mechanism of perchlorate reduction.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300029

Here, we show the unique, interlattice growth of the small molecule activating Ag-0 guest within the Lewis acidic/basic Fe3O4 octahedral host (Fe3O4@Ag-40, 10, 6, 2 at %) via a polyol-hydrothermal procedure. Microscopic (scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and structural characterization (powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) of the Fe3O4@Ag hybrid materials reveal doping of Ag-0 in Oh Fe2+ substitutional vacancies of the Fe3O4 host and Ag-0 nanoparticle growth on and embedded deep within (>400 nm, Ar+ sputtering) the octahedra. These hybrid materials activate CO2 and perform C(sp)-H and C(sp(3))-Cl bond scission of alkyne substrates to selectively produce lactone heterocycles in up to 85% yield. Control reactions delineate two distinct pathways for the mechanism involving the complementarity of interfacial sites where alkyne activation occurs at Fe-O sies and CO2 incorporation is predominately managed by Ag-0. The recyclability of the Fe3O4@Ag-40B hybrid catalyst is demonstrated over five cycles and it shows the structural integrity of the octahedra, but a gradual drop in yield of the product from 85 to 45% due to slow depletion of surface Ag NPs is observed. Together, these results illustrate a rare understanding of the cooperative synergy and mechanism of multimetallic nanocatalyst interfaces for multiple substrate reactivity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300045

The reaction, which utilizes [Ir(cod)Cl](2) and a commercially available chiral xyliphos ligand, proceeds in good yield with high levels of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity (up to 95% ee and >20:1 dr) on a range of differentially substituted isoquinolines. Directing-group studies demonstrate that the hydroxymethyl functional group at the C1 position is more efficient at enabling hydrogenation in comparison to other substituents, although high levels of enantioselectivity were conserved across a variety of polar and nonpolar functional groups. By utilization of the generated chiral beta-amino alcohol as a functional handle, the synthetic utility is further highlighted via the synthesis of 1,2-fused oxazolidine, oxazolidinone, and morpholinone tetrahydroisoquinolines in one step.

This atom economical reaction, which proceeds under operationally simple conditions, is compatible with a wide variety of dienes and provides a straightforward method to assemble different types of saturated lactams. The annulation is favored over alternative pathways in part because of the key role of the extra double bond of the diene partner.

The chelate coordination of the amido group to rhodium and the nonbonding interactions between the substrate and the ligand play important roles to afford chiral alpha-amidoboronic esters with quantitative conversions, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (92-99% ee). Computation of the catalytic cycle revealed selectivity both in the hydrogen activation and migratory insertion steps, equally contributing to the high enantioselectivity. In both cases, the nonbonding interactions provided by the Bpin group contributed significantly to the stabilization of the transition states in the lower energy pathway.									11	2	1	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300035

However, the inherent complexity of the lignin structure and the multiple pathways in lignin hydrogenolysis make gaining insight into the lignin hydrogenolysis mechanism even more challenging. In this report, a beta-O-4 polymer with deuterium incorporated at the alpha, beta, and gamma positions which can better model the plant lignin structure was prepared for mechanistic study. The location and retention of deuterium in the monomers resulting from the hydrogenolysis and transfer hydrogenolysis of the deuterated beta-O-4 mimics with Ru/C, Pd/C, and Pd/Zn/C in MeOH indicated that the beta-O-4 linkage protons did not participate in the cleavage process, which indicated that pathways involving dehydrogenation and/or dehydration reactions are infeasible for these catalysts under these conditions. A concerted process, wherein the C-a-O and C-beta-O bonds in beta-O-4 structures were cleaved concurrently, was proposed as a potential hydrogenolysis mechanism in the Pd/C and Ru/C systems. Dehydroxylation at the alpha position was identified as a side reaction in the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of dimer models, from which the same concurrent cleavage mechanism was also inferred. The introduction of a Lewis acid center in Pd/C was conducive to beta-O-4 hydrogenolysis, as confirmed by the abatement of the side reaction and the enhanced monomer yield in the polymeric model reactions. The use of deuterium-incorporated beta-O-4 mimics paved the way for clearly elucidating the lignin hydrogenolysis mechanism.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200048

The ee values for diastereomeric salts can exhibit significant differences (avg/high/median Delta(%ee) = 10/63/6; matched/mismatched effect), and in a few cases, they are better than those obtained with Lambda- or Delta-(S,S)-1(3+) 2Cl(-)BAr(f)(-). The crystal structure of Delta-(S,S)-1(3+) 2(1S)-camphSO(3)(-)BAr(f)(-) shows that the two sulfonate moieties hydrogen-bond to opposite (idealized) C-3-symmetric faces of the trication, with a separate oxygen atom associated with each of the three synperiplanar NH groups.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300037

However, the poor stability of these enzymes often limits their application in biocatalysis. Here, we used a framework for enzyme stability engineering by computational library design (FRESCO) to stabilize the homodimeric PLP fold type I omega-transaminase from Pseudomonas jessenii. A large number of surface-located point mutations and mutations predicted to stabilize the subunit interface were examined. Experimental screening revealed that 10 surface mutations out of 172 tested were indeed stabilizing (6% success), whereas testing 34 interface mutations gave 19 hits (56% success). Both the extent of stabilization and the spatial distribution of stabilizing mutations showed that the subunit interface was critical for stability. After mutations were combined, 2 very stable variants with 4 and 6 mutations were obtained, which in comparison to wild type (T-m(app) = 62 degrees C) displayed T-m(app) values of 80 and 85 degrees C, respectively. These two variants were also 5-fold more active at their optimum temperatures and tolerated high concentrations of isopropylamine and cosolvents. This allowed conversion of 100 mM acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethylamine (>99% enantiomeric excess) with high yield (92%, in comparison to 24% with the wild-type transaminase). Crystal structures mostly confirmed the expected structural changes and revealed that the most stabilizing mutation, 1154V, featured a rarely described stabilization mechanism: namely, removal of steric strain. The results show that computational interface redesign can be a rapid and powerful strategy for transaminase stabilization.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300004	32953233

Prxs offer a major model of protein-thiol oxidative modification. They react with H2O2 to form a sulfenic acid intermediate that either engages into a disulfide bond, committing the enzyme into its peroxidase cycle, or again reacts with peroxide to produce a sulfinic acid that inactivates the enzyme. Sensitivity to sulfinylation depends on the kinetics of these two competing reactions and is critically influenced by a structural transition from a fully folded (FF) to locally unfolded (LU) conformation. Analysis of the reaction of the Tsal Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prx with H2O2 by Trp fluorescence based rapid kinetics revealed a process linked to the FF/LU transition that is kinetically distinct from disulfide formation and suggested that sulfenate formation facilitates local unfolding. Use of mutants of distinctive sensitivities and of different peroxide substrates showed that sulfinylation sensitivity is not coupled to the resolving step kinetics but depends only on the sulfenic acid oxidation and FF-to-LU transition rate constants. In addition, stabilization of the active site FF conformation, the determinant of sulfinylation kinetics, is only moderately influenced by the Prx C-terminal tail dynamics that determine the FF -> LU kinetics. From these two parameters, the relative sensitivities of Prxs toward hyperoxidation with different substrates can be predicted, as confirmed by in vitro and in vivo patterns of sulfinylation.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300043	32363077

In natural photosynthesis, photosystem I (PSI) exhibits an intrinsic quantum efficiency of nearly 100% in solar energy conversion. The elaborate synergy of electron transfer and electron utilization guarantees the conversion of unstable excited electrons to stable electrons in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). To demonstrate this in vitro, we report a design of core-shell metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as an "electron buffer tank" to coordinate electron transfer and electron utilization in photocatalysis. The electrons are generated via the irradiation on photosensitizers (2-aminoterephthalic acid, NH2-BDC) in the core and then transferred to Zr6O8 clusters on the shell through the light-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer mechanism. Neighboring reaction centers, [Cp*Rh(bpydc)H2O](2+), on the MOFs behave as the electron buffer tank and store these electrons in the form of hydrides for subsequent regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The electron lifetime is prolonged from nanoseconds to seconds, leading to 2.27-fold enhancement of electron availability and 2.08-fold enhancement of activity compared to the homogeneous reaction counterpart. The coupling of NADH regeneration and enzyme catalysis further enables the asymmetric reduction of carbonyl to chiral amine. The electron buffer tank concept may offer a generic strategy to coordinate mass transfer and chemical reaction in a broad range of catalytic processes.									15	1	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300002

Now, we report evidence of the reactivity and the quantitative characterization of the missing linker defects on the Zr12O22 nodes in the MOF hcp UiO-66 (these are paired Zr6O8 nodes bridged by OH groups) and those on the Zr6O8 nodes of the MOF UiO-66. The defect sites catalyze the ring-opening reactions of epoxides with alcohols, and new sites formed by removal of bridging OH groups on the Zr12O22 nodes also participate in the catalysis. The hcp UiO-66 was synthesized from UiO-66 and from molecular precursors, and, under various synthesis conditions, the nodes incorporated acetate ligands, where linkers were missing, and the number of these ligands was controlled by the synthesis conditions. These ligands are inhibitors of the catalytic reactions, and their removal by reaction with, for example, methanol (to form, for example, methyl acetate) preceded catalysis on the defect sites. The former MOF incorporated more defect sites than the latter, correspondingly being a more active catalyst. The defect sites on the Zr12O22 nodes are 2-6 times more active per site than those on the isolated Zr6O8 nodes, with the node-bridging OH groups increasing the catalytic activity of the neighboring node defect sites because new sites are formed by their removal. The results help point the way to the design and control of catalytic sites on metal oxide-like MOF nodes by tuning of the number and reactivity of the defect sites.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300003

Obtained ATR-FTIR data sets were analyzed via multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), which enabled us to clearly differentiate various reaction pathways for different Pt loadings at otherwise fixed reaction conditions (i.e., methanol concentration, UV intensity). At the highest Pt loading (nominal concentration of 2.7 wt %), photo oxidation of methanol occurs via direct oxidation through a formaldehyde intermediate to CO2, whereas the lower Pt loadings of 0.7 and 1.4 wt % favor a side reaction that includes methyl formate as an intermediate. These findings were correlated with the formation of different CO binding sites on Pt during photodeposition, and we presume that changes in the reaction pathway depend on the number rather than the nature of active available Pt sites. Complementary ex situ characterizations of the thin films by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were performed, delivering information on the generated Pt nanoparticles and structural changes of TiO2. The presented optical setup paves the way for fundamental studies of heterogeneous catalytic reactions as close as possible to their actual use in aqueous systems.									7	2	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300008

The kinetic data collected to develop this model includes ethanol, 1-butanol, and water-ethanol feeds at 350 degrees C, 1 bar, and between 3 and 20% conversion over HAP. The model consists of nine kinetic parameters describing 647 reactions among 185 alcohols. Inhibition from byproduct water leads to decreases in reaction rates and alcohol selectivities as conversion increases, which the model can accurately predict at 60% conversion at over 8 times the highest contact time used in model development. The modified step growth kinetics underlying the model also accurately predict alcohol distributions at this conversion. Further extrapolations clarify how these kinetics (modified step growth wherein branched alcohols do not act nucleophilically) in addition to inhibition and side reactions affect the potential use of direct ethanol oligomerization to selectively produce heavy alcohols with HAP. Further deviations from step-growth kinetics can be modeled via manipulation of the apparent nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of ethanol relative to higher alcohols. Catalysts that could increase the nucleophilicity would lead to higher product linearities, while catalysts that decrease the electrophilicity would lead to heavier alcohol distributions at fixed conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300009

Here, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the participation of the ceria support in the redox catalysis. To unravel the structural dynamics of vanadia/ceria (VOx/CeO2) catalysts during ethanol ODH, we have applied a combination of operando multiwavelength Raman and operando UV-vis spectroscopy. Our approach consists of the targeted use of different Raman excitation wavelengths, enabling the selective enhancement of ceria (at 385 nm) and vanadia (at 515 nm) vibrational features. As part of the support dynamics, ceria lattice oxygen is shown to directly participate in the ODH reaction, while V-O-Ce interface bonds are broken during substrate adsorption, resulting in ethoxide formation. The presence of V-O-Ce bonds is considered to be crucial for the observed synergy effect in catalytic performance, allowing ceria to act as an oxygen buffer stabilizing the vanadium center. By providing an experimental basis for a detailed understanding of working VOx/CeO2 catalysts, our results highlight the importance of active support participation in oxide catalysis.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300011

However, tuning the selectivity of a desired product in a controllable manner remains difficult. In this study, we performed MTH reactions on DDR zeolites at 400 degrees C and subcoinplete methanol conversions to investigate how the highly constrained pore structure of a DDR zeolite impacts on the reaction pathways and the product selectivity. We find that the propylene selectivity monotonically increases as the aluminum content and crystallize size of the DDR zeolite decreases. With this understanding, we are able to maximize the propylene selectivity up to 50.6% by modifying the DDR zeolite. We performed isotopic tracing experiments and analysis of residual species in the catalysts to validate the dual-cycle (aromatic- and olefin-based cycle) mechanism in DDR zeolite-catalyzed MTH and demonstrate that propylene is primarily produced from the olefin-based cycle. We attribute the unique behavior of DDR zeolites to that their ultrasmall pore sizes impose restriction on the molecular diffusion of higher olefins, leading to a more important role of the olefin-based catalytic cycle in the reaction, in comparison with other zeolites with larger pores.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300012

Utilizing one-dimensional Pt3Co NWs as the basic catalyst model, here we have successfully demonstrated significant improvements in electrocatalytic durability and activity derived from doping of Ga atoms. The optimized surface energy caused by the doping of Ga atoms drives the resulting catalysts to exhibit good durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis. However, although oxygen binding energy (E-O) would rather deviate from the optimal value because of excessive Ga on the surface, the formation of proper Ga-O bonding can also promote oxygen binding to approach an optimal value, which results in an enhanced ORR activity. It can be therefore concluded that doping of an appropriate amount of Ga atoms has a positive effect in improving the ORR performance of the catalyst, not only in terms of specific activity but also in durability. This interesting phenomenon was also further extended to improve the catalysis of methanol oxidation (MOR) and ethanol oxidation (EOR) reactions, thus reflecting multifunctionalities of lavender-like Ga-doped Pt3Co NWs on fuel cell reactions. This study highlights the great potential of Ga-doped strategies for surface and near-surface regulation, which can effectively address the poor durability of 1D Pt-based NWs for energy catalytic technology.									23	2	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300013

The role of superelectrophilic Ga2Cl6 homodimers has been confirmed and explained. The results are consistent with the observation of second-order rate dependence in GaCl3-mediated Friedel-Crafts alkylations. This work also reveals that, even in a typical Friedel-Crafts alkylation, no Wheland-type sigma-complex can be modeled, suggesting a concerted electrophilic aromatic substitution. Also refuted is the possibility of activation of the arene nucleophile by the Lewis acid.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300014

Copper radical oxidases from Auxiliary Activity Family 5/Subfamily 2 (AA5_2) are attractive biocatalysts because they oxidize primary alcohols in a chemoselective manner without complex organic cofactors. However, despite numerous studies on canonical galactose oxidases (GalOx, EC 1.1.3.9) and engineered variants, and the recent discovery of a Colletotrichum graminicola copper radical alcohol oxidase (AlcOx, EC 1.1.3.13), the catalytic potentials of very few AA5_2 members have been characterized. Guided by the sequence similarity network and phylogenetic analyses, we targeted a distinct paralog from the fungus C. graminicola as a representative member of a large uncharacterized subgroup of AA5_2. Through recombinant production and detailed kinetic analysis, we demonstrated that this enzyme is weakly active toward carbohydrates but efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of aryl alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. As such, this represents the initial characterization of a demonstrable aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO, EC 1.1.3.7) in AAS, an activity which is classically associated with Flavin-dependent glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases of Auxiliary Activity Family 3 (AA3). X-ray crystallography revealed a distinct multidomain architecture comprising an N-terminal PAN domain abutting a canonical AA5 seven-bladed propeller catalytic domain. Of direct relevance to biomass processing, the wild-type enzyme exhibits the highest activity on the primary alcohol of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a product of significant interest in the lignocellulosic biorefinery concept. Thus, the chemoselective oxidation of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) by C. graminicola aryl alcohol oxidase (CgrAAO) from AAS provides a fundamental building block for chemistry via biotechnology.									12	0	0	0	5	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300016

It is shown that the initial steps of this reaction-the active catalyst formation and the C-Cl bond activation-proceed via the "base-assisted oxidative addition" mechanism and require only a 16.2 kcal/mol barrier. The following steps of the reaction are palladacycle and Pd-aryne formations, among which the former is favorable: it proceeds with a moderate C-H activation barrier and is slightly exergonic. Although the Pd-aryne formation requires a slightly lower energy barrier, it is highly endergonic. It is shown that the base plays important roles also in the palladacycle formation and facilitates the driving of the reaction forward by removing a proton to the solution via the bicarbonate-to-carbonate exchange mechanism. Addition of the second C-Cl bond to the thermodynamically favorable palladacycle, i.e., Pd(II)/Pd(IV) oxidation, is a rate-limiting step of the entire Pd-catalyzed and Cs-carbonate-mediated ACD reactions: it occurs with a 35.8 kcal/mol energy barrier and is exergonic by 25.1 kcal/mol. The following polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation is a multistep process and requires a lesser energy barrier. An alternative pathway, namely, cyclooctatetraene (COT) formation, requires a higher energy barrier and is not feasible. This finding is consistent with experiments that show no COT product in the utilized conditions. The calculations also indicate that the observed diminishing of the yield of the Pd-catalyzed ACD reaction upon the use of Na2CO3 instead of Cs2CO3 is the result of not only the poor solubility of Na-carbonate in the used experimental conditions but also a prohibitively large free-energy barrier required for the second C-Cl activation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300017

It enables the production of syngas from CO2 and CH4 reforming. While Ni catalyst presents a high activity regarding this process, it often suffers from deactivation. It was found that the Sn-doped Ni catalyst can avoid carbon deposition, but a decrease in DRM reactivity was also observed. In this work, we used density functional theory calculations in combination with microkinetic modeling first to understand how Sn doping affects the resistance to carbon deposition and the surface catalytic activities of Ni. Based on the understandings, we found that an ideal dopant should give rise to a proper adsorption energy of carbon such that (i) the C* formation process, e.g., CH4 dissociation, is rate-controlling to improve the carbon resistance and (ii) relatively low dissociation barriers of CH4 and CO2 can be achieved to maintain a good activity. Therefore, the adsorption energy of carbon and the dissociation barriers of CH4 and CO2 can be utilized as descriptors for the stability and activity of Ni-based catalysts. Subsequently, we screened several metal dopants and found that the descriptors designed are capable of providing a consistent activity and stability trend with experiments reported in the literature. Therefore, our work could provide relevant guidelines to rationally design efficient catalysts for the DRM reaction.									28	2	0	0	0	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300018

Even for CO oxidation over SACs on nonreducible substrates, the understanding is limited. We investigated the performance of Pd atoms monodispersed on graphene (PdGr) in CO oxidation. Combining first-principles-based thermodynamics calculations and microkinetics modeling, we showed that the positively charged PdGr can exhibit a rather high low-temperature activity in CO oxidation. Under reaction conditions, the Pd atom binds strongly with 02, acting as the reactive species to convert CO. A comparison of the conversion rates of steps along different potential reaction pathways provides direct evidence that CO oxidation mainly proceeds through revised Langmuir-Hinshelwood pathways, and the dissociation of the peroxide intermediate (O-O-C=O) is the rate limiting step. The predicted catalytic performance was attributed to the specific electronic structure of PdGr with the positively charged Pd on graphene monovacancy exposing sp-type frontier states. We expect these findings to help in understanding the performance of SACs and to guide the design and fabrication of SACs with superior catalytic performance.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300019

The engineered mutant alcohol dehydrogenase II binds Zn2+ with high binding affinity and is functional under aerobic and oxidative conditions for a longer time than the wild-type, Fe2+-binding alcohol dehydrogenase II. Overall, the mutant enzyme demonstrated electrochemical activity toward both acetaldehyde reduction and ethanol oxidation reactions.

D-Glucose and glycerol have emerged in recent years as prospective replacements for fossil fuels used in the production of high-value chemicals, and cell-free bioproduction routes are expected to play a crucial role in such processes. Recently, several synthetic cascades used for the cell-free biotransformations of D-glucose and glycerol to pyruvate and beyond have been described. However, these were limited by the very slow dehydration step of D-glycerate to pyruvate catalyzed by a dehydratase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsDHAD), making this step by far the major bottleneck. By combining the vast number of available genomes with a sequence-based discovery approach, we have identified signature sequences leading to the discovery of two distinct classes of dehydratases which exhibit promising activity and total turnover number (TTN) toward D-glycerate. In particular, the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT) demonstrated >100-fold higher activity and TTN for D-glycerate in comparison to SsDHAD. In addition, PuDHT showed exceptionally high activity and TTN toward D-gluconate. The replacement of SsDHAD by PuDHT in our model cascade from D-glucose to ethanol enhanced the production rate 10-fold, reaching a 92% theoretical yield at 50 degrees C. PuDHT was also suitable for the conversion of glycerol to pyruvate at ambient temperature, leading to a >5-fold improvement in production rate in comparison to the system utilizing SsDHAD at 50 degrees C and attaining 97% of the theoretical yield. PuDHT was also compatible when crude glycerol was used as the substrate, and it no longer caused a bottleneck in the enzymatic cascade.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300022

Their Fe site structure was investigated by UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Mossbauer spectroscopy at different temperatures including cryogenic conditions, and their selective catalytic reduction (SCR) activity was studied between 400 and 870 K. Mossbauer analysis was performed by establishing consistent models that well represent cryogenic measurements at low and high magnetic fields (10 mT and 5 T, respectively) but also low-field measurements at higher temperatures, which were performed in order to evaluate their analytical potential. It was found that a reliable analysis in particular of species in small structures (binary, oligomeric sites) requires modeling of cryogenic Mossbauer data with spin-Hamiltonian formalism, which needs to be combined with input from EPR spectroscopy for specifying/confining the type of paramagnetic Fe-III site to be included in the model. Spin-Hamiltonian formalism (combined with input from EPR) can be applied also to measurements at higher temperatures where reliable results for paramagnetic Fe-III and Fe-II sites and for the sum of superparamagnetic Fe-III species and particles can be obtained from spectra measured at 77 K. While qualitative observations in EPR spectra of initial samples were in good agreement with quantitative site abundances obtained from the Mossbauer spectra, there were significant deviations between the latter and results from UV-vis measurements. Mossbauer-derived site distributions in postcatalytic samples (after reaction at 670 K) showed that the standard SCR rate correlates well with the abundance of oligomeric Fe-III oxo sites, in particular with binary Fe-III-O-Fe-III structures, although an intercept may indicate a minor relevance of an additional species. The clear correlation between rates and abundance of Fe-III sites rejects reoxidation as a rate-limiting step for the given catalysts and reaction conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300023

It is, however, a challenging task to synthesize nanostructured catalysts with such defective surfaces. Hence, we present a one-step and upscalable top-down approach to produce a Pt/C catalyst (with similar to 3 nm Pt nanoparticle diameter). Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and tomography, electrochemical techniques, high-energy X-ray measurements, and positron annihilation spectroscopy, we provide evidence of a high density of surface defects (including surface concavities). The ORR activity of the developed catalyst exceeds that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst, at least 2.7 times in terms of specific activity (similar to 1.62 mA/cm(Pt)(2), at 0.9 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) and at least 1.7 times in terms of mass activity (similar to 712 mA/mg(Pt)), which can be correlated to the enhanced amount of surface defects. In addition, the technique used here reduces the complexity of the synthesis (and therefore production costs) in comparison to state of the art bottom-up techniques.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300024

While wild-type (WT) RPA1163 shows high thermostability and fairly wide substrate scope, many interesting yet poorly or moderately accepted substrates exist. In order to solve this problem and to develop upscaled production, in silico calculations and semirational mutagenesis were employed. Residue W185 was engineered to alanine, serine, threonine, or asparagine. The two best mutants, W185N and W185T, showed significantly improved performance in the reactions of these substrates, while in silico calculations shed light on the origin of these improvements. Finally, 10 alpha-fluorocarboxylic acids and 10 alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids were prepared on a gram scale via kinetic resolution enabled by WT, W185T, or WI 85N. This work expands the biocatalytic toolbox and allows a deep insight into the fluoroacetate dehalogenase catalyzed C-F cleavage mechanism.									8	1	0	0	6	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300025

This study unravels structure sensitivity of ultrasmall Ag nanocubes with lengths below 25 and 70 nm (L25- and L70-Ag-NCs) enclosed completely by the (100) facet toward an efficient CO2RR to CO. The ultrasmall L25-Ag-NCs deliver a remarkably larger current density, a significantly higher Faraday efficiency (FE) of near-unity, and a comparably higher energy efficiency of 64.0% as well as a better stability of similar to 18 h as compared to L70-Ag-NCs, Ag nanoparticles, and bulk Ag. More importantly, CO generation initiates at an ultralow overpotential of 146 mV, accompanied with a remarkably high onset CO FE of 59.6%, further demonstrating the excellence of L25-Ag-NCs for highly active and selective CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations, the percentages of various catalytically active sites, and how the architecture of NCs affecting the active sites as well as the partial density of states were analyzed; the results reveal that the essential origins credited for the enhanced catalytic activity and near-unity CO selectivity over L25-Ag-NCs at lowered eta originate from the particular nanostructure, where energetically favorable active sites toward CO2RR are maximally introduced through accurately synthesizing the specific nanostructure enclosed by a certain facet.									37	1	0	0	2	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300027

Insights from CO Oxidation on Au-Supported Ceria Nanoparticles Using Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics								ACS CATALYSIS				10	5			3164	3174		10.1021/acscatal.9b05175				MAR 6 2020	2020	Gold-supported ceria nanoparticles (CeOx/Au), constituting an inverse system with respect to the more commonly studied ceria-supported gold nanoparticles, were previously identified as an excellent catalyst for water-gas shift reaction, CO oxidation, and steam reforming of methanol. However, the electronic structure and reactivity of such inverse catalysts have not been well understood. To probe the inherent nanoparticle-support interactions and their mechanistic role for the catalytic CO oxidation over this composite catalyst, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and static density functional theory computations have been carried out for Au(111)-supported ceria clusters (Ce10O20/19), as a realistic model system of an inverse CeOx/Au catalyst. We have identified the perimeter of the supported ceria nanoparticle as the most favorable O vacancy formation site; however, the vacancy further migrates to an inner interface site during the thermalization process, simultaneously triggering electron transfer from ceria to Au. Our study shows that the Au(111) surface always withdraws electron density from ceria, irrespective of the chemical environment, namely, in a reducing (Ce10O19) as well as oxidizing (Ce10O20) environment. To mimic a realistic catalytic environment, CO and O-2 molecules were preadsorbed on the surface of a composite catalyst. We find a vacancy diffusion-assisted Mars-van Krevelen type of reaction mechanism in which the first CO molecule reacts with a lattice O atom of ceria rather than with an activated O-2(2-) species, forming CO2 and leaving one O vacancy behind. This vacancy becomes subsequently refilled by an O atom diffusing from the site of O-2 reaction with a second CO molecule, recovering the stoichiometry of the Ce10O19 cluster and closing the catalytic cycle. Finally, we discuss differences and similarities between ceria/Au and Au-n/ceria with respect to surface dynamics, charge transfer between the gold and the oxide phases, and the mechanism of CO oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300028

Here, we report on how these factors are interconnected. Combining time-resolved transmission electron microscopy imaging and selected area electron diffraction with online conversion detection, CO oxidation over Pt nanoparticles was studied at a pressure of 700 mbar and temperatures up to 500 degrees C. The different interactions between reactants and catalysts over the entire range of catalytic conversion were investigated. Chemical dynamics in this reaction were found to consist of both morphological transformations and fluctuating structural dynamics. Morphological transformations were observed mostly in low activity regimes, leading to nanoparticles with increased stable surface facets. Meanwhile structural changes were observed during high activity regimes where the partial pressures remained constant. Furthermore, the observed changes were found to occur in both the bulk and the surface of the catalyst. Catalytic cycling revealed that morphological transformations and structural dynamics have different implications on the reactivity and are mostly irreversible.									18	2	0	0	3	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300030

However, tackling the key problem of cocatalyst loading position over heterojunction photocatalysts is still a great challenge. We herein report a facile and general light-tuning photodeposition strategy to realize site-directed spatial loading of diverse cocatalysts (MoS2, NixS, NixO, NixP, Pt) onto a CdS/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst, thereby abating surface charge recombination and markedly improving the photoredox-catalyzed activity of hydrogen evolution and selective oxidation of alcohol. This work highlights the wide scope of manipulating light to spatially regulate the cocatalyst loading position, thereby optimizing surface/interface charge recombination dynamics and ameliorating the net efficiency of charge separation and photoredox catalysis.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300031

The surface -anchored nano-MOFs (SA-NMOFs) were prepared by covalent anchoring of a presynthesized, functionalized UiO-66 nano-MOF (NMOF) on surface-modified poly(dimethylsiloxane). The SA-NMOFs exhibit discrete NMOFs (<30 nm) which do not aggregate. The SA-NMOFs retain a high surface area, rendering them interesting catalysts. We compared the catalytic activities of SA-NMOFs in the cyanosilylation of benzaldehyde with those of the bulk UiO-66 and colloidal-dispersed UiO-66 NMOFs (size: 22 +/- 3 nm). The SA-NMOFs exhibit a boost in activity by a factor of 100,000-1,000,000 owing to (a) the generally larger surface area of NMOFs and (b) the suppressed aggregation of the nanoparticles by surface immobilization. In contrast, colloidal NMOFs rapidly aggregate, as shown by dynamic light scattering. The general applicability of our approach for other Lewis acid-catalyzed reactions is demonstrated by comparing the activities of the three catalyst systems for the cycloaddition of CO2 and propylene oxide to propylene carbonate, where SA-NMOFs by far outperform the bulk MOFs and defect-engineered MOFs, respectively. This discovery paves the way for application of SA-NMOFs as efficient catalyst materials.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300032

In addition to intrinsic activity control, geometrical factors of electrocatalysts such as their porous structure have been demonstrated to affect the reaction selectivity, but understanding its origin is still important. Herein, we demonstrate that reduced graphene oxide layers can effectively control the Faradaic efficiency for CO production of porous zinc nanoparticle electrocatalysts. Simply tuning for CO production from 66 to 94% even in the bicarbonate electrolyte the coverage of graphene oxide dramatically varies Faradaic efficiency at the same biased potential, in which the hydrogen evolution rate was notably suppressed without sacrificing CO2 reduction to CO production rate unlike many Zn-based electrocatalysts. The graphene oxide layers are revealed to play roles in providing geometric barriers for the mass transport channels of reactants rather than changing the chemical states of the Zn-based electrocatalysts according to in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical reaction kinetic studies. In addition, computational fluid dynamics simulation studies estimate the Faradaic efficiency dependence on the surface coverage and suggest that the selective suppression of H-2 evolution is associated with the larger increment in local pH compared to that in local pCO(2) at the porous electrocatalyst surfaces. Decoupling between these reactant concentrations is originated from the higher consumption rate and lower bulk concentration of proton compared to those of CO2, and the surface coating with graphene oxide can be an effective way to control mass transport channel.									18	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300034

In this contribution, we report the performance of In2O3 with different crystal phases in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, where we observe changing activity induced by a phase transition under reaction conditions. Cubic In2O3 (c-In2O3) exhibits a higher RWGS rate than the hexagonal phase (h-In2O3) at temperatures below 350 degrees C because of its (1) enhanced dissociative adsorption of H-2, (2) facile formation of the oxygen vacancies, and (3) enhanced ability to adsorb and activate CO2 on the oxygen vacancies, as suggested both experimentally and computationally. Density functional theory results indicate that the surface oxygen arrangement on the cubic polymorph is key to rapid H-2 adsorption, which facilitates oxygen vacancy formation and subsequent CO2 adsorption to yield high RWGS reactivity. At 450 degrees C and above, the activity of h-In2O3 increases gradually with time on stream, which is caused by a phase transition from h-In2O3 to c-In2O3. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments show that h-In2O3 is first reduced by H-2 and subsequently oxidized by CO2 to c-In2O3. These findings highlight the importance of the crystal phase in the catalytic RWGS reaction and provide a new dimension for understanding/designing RWGS catalysts.									29	1	0	0	4	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300038

Upon the incorporation of Zr into the ceria support, the catalyst exhibited a significantly improved activity and H-2 selectivity. To understand the effects of the Zr dopant on Ni and CeO2 during the dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction and to probe the structure-reactivity relationship underlying the enhanced catalytic performance of the mixed-oxide system, in situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) were employed to characterize the catalysts under reaction conditions. TR-XRD and AP-XPS indicate that ceria-zirconia supported Ni (Ni/CeZrO2) is of higher reducibility than the pure ceria supported Ni (Ni/CeO2) upon the reaction with pure CH4 or for the methane dry reforming reaction. The active state of Ni/CeZrO2 under optimum DRM conditions (700 degrees C) was identified as Ni, Ce3+/Ce4+, and Zr4+. The particle size of both nickel and the ceria support under reaction conditions was analyzed by Rietveld refinement and extended XAFS fitting. Zr in the ceria support prevents particle sintering and maintains small particle sizes for both metallic nickel and the partially reduced ceria support under reaction conditions through a stronger-metal support interaction. Additionally, Zr prevents Ni migration from the surface into ceria forming a Ce1-xNixO2-y solid solution, which is seen in Ni/CeO2, thus helping to preserve the active Ni-0 on the Ni/CeZrO2 surface.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300039

A high performance was observed with a Pd-ZnO/TiO2 catalyst, with 99.9% DMA selectivity at 94% MA conversion. By contrast, both Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZnO were less active and/or selective. The catalytic performance of Pd-ZnO/TiO2 largely depended on reduction temperature and ZnO loading. The rates for MA conversion (rate(MA)) and DMA production (rate(DMA)) increased linearly with the amount of PdZn alloy formed. The reaction was likely to take place via intermediates of N-methylformanilide (MFA) and formate. Formate was produced through the reduction of CO2 with H-2 as confirmed by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and then added to MA producing MFA, and finally, MFA was subsequently adsorbed and hydrogenated to DMA. All these steps were promoted by the PdZn alloy. The hydrogenation of MFA to DMA was much faster than the N-methylation of MA to MFA; DMA was stable, so the selectivity to DMA was almost 100% over the Pd-ZnO/TiO2 catalyst.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300040

Among these, ZSM-5 is the most investigated solid that can be obtained in various forms, with some of these (hierarchical forms, nanoslabs, nano-sheets, and nanocrystals) exhibiting a very high external surface to volume ratio. Whereas most knowledge obtained so far at the atomic level concerns the internal nanopores, we here propose a density functional theory (DFT) study to establish the relative stability of relevant surface orientations for silicalite and ZSM-S crystals ((100), (010), and (101)) at different hydration levels to identify the equilibrium morphology of the particles and the major sites present on their surfaces. Several kinds of surface sites have been identified. Bridging Al-OH-Si groups are present at the pore mouth with stability similar to or higher than those in bulk sites. Yet, these groups are not stable at the outermost surface, where the following groups prevail: Si-OH, Al-OH groups, and most importantly water adsorbed on aluminum, Al-(H2O)(OH)(n). Water desorption reactions occur at temperatures that strongly depend on the local topology of the surface site and on the surface orientation: when a siloxane bridge is present below the surface Al atom, water desorption is promoted by the formation of an additional Al-O bond with the oxygen of the siloxane bridge. However, if such a bridge is not present below the surface aluminum atom, desorption leads to a less stable surface Al-III atom. The desorption temperature is influenced by this feature, as well as by the stabilization of the water molecule by hydrogen bonds, depending on the silanol content of the surface. This has in turn direct consequences on the Bronsted and Lewis acid properties, as probed by pyridine. Strong Lewis acid sites can easily be formed on the (010) orientation (relevant for nanosheets), whereas they are unlikely to occur at the (101) surface (tips of coffin-shaped particles), which promotes the mild Bronsted acid sites Al-(H2O) instead.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300041

The HER activity of the group 5 TMDs originates from the unsaturated chalcogen edges and the highly active surface basal planes, whereas the HER activity of the widely studied group 6 TMDs originates solely from the chalcogen- or metal-unsaturated edges. However, the batch production of such nanomaterials and their scalable processing into high-performance electrocatalysts is still challenging. Herein, we report the liquid-phase exfoliation of the 2H-TaS2 crystals by using 2-propanol to produce single/few-layer (1H/2H) flakes, which are afterward deposited as catalytic films. A thermal treatment-aided texturization of the catalytic films is used to increase their porosity, promoting the ion access to the basal planes of the flakes, as well as the number of catalytic edges of the flakes. The hybridization of the H-TaS2 flakes and H-TaSe2 flakes tunes the Gibbs free energy of the adsorbed atomic hydrogen onto the H-TaS2 basal planes to the optimal thermo-neutral value. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the heterogeneous catalysts exhibit a low overpotential (versus RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) at the cathodic current of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) of 120 mV and high mass activity of 314 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 200 mV. In 1 M KOH, they show a eta(10) of 230 mV and a mass activity of 220 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV. Our results provide new insight into the usage of the metallic group 5 TMDs for the HER through scalable material preparation and electrode processing.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300042	33815892

In this work, we show that the framework Al atoms are enriched around intracrystalline mesopores that encapsulate Pt nanoparticles in H-ZSM-S, referred to as the "halo effect". The molecular level proximity between Bronsted acid and Pt sites is demonstrated by quantitative Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The halo effect enables the selective conversion of furfural to valeric acid and ethyl valerate (VA/EV) via a 5-step tandem reaction in one pot with an 86% yield. In contrast, control experiments show that catalysts with identical metal and acid site densities but without the halo effect produce only a 5% yield of VA/EV under identical conditions. The ready access of intermediates to the active sites in the subsequent reaction enabled by the halo effect is key to the enhanced performance in tandem catalysis and reduced catalyst deactivation.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300044

Through both in vitro and in vivo analysis, we provide a plausible enzymatic pathway for CHC-CoA biosynthesis from shikimate. This pathway highlights a shikimoyl-CoA synthetase that is highly promiscuous toward a wide range of cycloalkane and benzoate substrates. In addition, an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is shown to have evolved to be a FAD-dependent nonredox dehydratase that is distinct from any known FAD-dependent dehydratases.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300046

Herein, aimed at elucidating pyridine modification-carbonylation activity relationships and developing high-performance catalysts, we investigated the adsorption/desorption behaviors of pyridine on MOR zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios and their impact on DME carbonylation. Instead of the previously proposed selective adsorption of pyridine in 12-MR channels, pyridine is revealed to penetrate into 8-MR side pockets of MOR zeolites and interact with acidic hydroxyls therein. Upon heating, pyridine in pockets desorbs preferentially, likely arising from the lower stability of pyridine adspecies in constrained spaces. This well explains the observed of carbonylation activity following the increase of pretreatment temperature. Unprecedentedly, high MA yield (7.2 mmol/(h g)) has been achieved on pyridine-modified MOR (Si/Al = 13.8) under controlled pyridine desorption conditions, resulting from the joint contributions of better diffusion properties and larger amounts of active acid sites. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Bronsted acid sites within 8-MR pockets is demonstrated to be inhomogeneous, closely associated with their locations.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300048

A bulk Pt piece is usually used as a counter electrode in such systems because of its high activity and stability in many electrochemical reactions. However, the dissolution of the Pt counter electrode led to growing concern about inaccurate evaluation of the inherent characteristics of the analyte. In the present study, we have demonstrated that strong interferences emerged from the conventional Pt counter and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes in the photo electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a model photocathode of p-type silicon (p-Si). Under light illumination, the Pt counter electrode is polarized to as high as 1.6-2.0 V-RHE, which leads to a non-negligible Pt dissolution from the oxidized surface, as monitored by operando inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Postreaction spectroscopy and microscopy studies confirm the formation of Pt and Ag particles on p-Si photocathode, resulting in erroneous overestimation of the HER activity of p-Si. Various configurations of the three-electrode system, e.g., an H-type cell with a Nafion membrane, have been studied to find a suitable cell structure for prohibiting undesirable contamination of p-Si. Isolation of p-Si from the Pt counter and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes using the Nafion membrane effectively alleviates the contamination of p-Si but, toward the end, the metallic ions can be slowly deposited on p-Si by diffusion through the membrane. Consequently, this work highlights that the careful caution is necessary when the conventional Pt counter and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes are employed; it is recommended to use a graphite counter electrode and separate reference electrode to prevent artifacts originating from the dissolved Pt and Ag species during PEC cathode evaluations.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300049

Various noble-metal-based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been reported for this process. The development of cheap non-noble-metal heterogeneous catalysts for the N-alkylation reaction would be highly desirable. Hereby, we propose the N-alkylation of amines by alcohols over a cheap and efficient heterogeneous catalyst-titanium hydroxide. This catalyst provides a selectivity higher than 90% to secondary amines for functionalized aromatic and aliphatic alcohols and amines with high catalytic activity and stability. Mild Bronsted acidity formed by the continuous rehydration of Lewis acidity excludes the side reactions and deactivation by adsorbed species. The mechanism of the reaction involves dehydration of alcohols to ethers with subsequent C-O bond cleavage by amine with the formation of secondary amine and recovery of alcohol.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300052

The optimum performance reported by us recently [ACS Catal. 2019, 9, 9150-9157] in terms of selectivity toward the formation of cinnamyl alcohol, the desired product, by the catalyst with x = 0.005 was corroborated. A rapid decrease was seen in catalytic activity in batch reactors with all catalysts, in particular with pure Cu/SBA-15. This was ascribed, based on DFT calculations and microkinetic simulations, to the relative weak adsorption of the reactant compared to that of the products, which leads to the blocking of catalytic sites by the latter early on in the catalytic runs. It was determined that selectivity is controlled by the relative values of the initial rate constants for hydrogenation to the unsaturated alcohol versus the saturated aldehyde. Those were found to vary by up to an order of magnitude as a function of Pt content in the catalyst, in spite of the fact that the hydrogenation steps are presumed to occur on Cu, not Pt, sites. In general, significant changes in equilibrium and kinetic parameters were seen across the series of catalysts tested (versus x), indicating that the addition of even small amounts of Pt to these Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts affects the intrinsic performance of the hydrogenation catalytic sites.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300055

However, real materials are unlikely to display a uniform site structure, which limits the scope of current efforts focused on idealized models for future implementation. Here, we prepare distinct nickel entities (single atoms or nanoparticles) on nitrogen-doped carbons and evaluate them in eCO(2)RR. Single atoms demonstrate a characteristic high selectivity to CO. However, this is not altered by the presence of metal nanoparticles formed upon reducing the nitrogen content of the carrier. In contrast, nanoparticles incorporated via a colloidal route promote the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. In these systems, the CO selectivity evolves upon repeated exposure to potential, reaching values comparable to single atoms. By introducing CO stripping voltammetry as a characterization tool for this class of materials, we identify a decreased metallic surface, suggesting that the nanoparticle surface is altered by CO. The findings highlight the critical role of dynamic effects in catalyst design for eCO(2)RR.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300056

Herein, a distinct class of one-dimensional (1D) ultrathin Pt3Sn nanofibers (NFs) with controllable aspect ratios and intermetallic structure was designed as highly efficient EOR electrocatalysts. The optimized structurally ordered Pt3Sn NFs with the largest aspect ratio (Pt3Sn NFs-L) show the highest activity and long-term stability compared with the commercial Pt/C and other counterparts. Apart from the intrinsic structural advantages, the incorporated Sn on Pt3Sn NFs-L can effectively alleviate the binding strength of reaction intermediates and further promote the electrooxidation of intermediates by providing abundant oxophilic species, largely contributing to the enhanced EOR activity and stability. Detailed investigations indicate that Pt3Sn NFs-L possess a strong capacity for C-C bond cleavage in ethanol, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. Moreover, Pt3Sn NFs-L with highlighted antipoisoning property can also display enhanced performance for the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), demonstrating its promising performance in various alcohol electrooxidation reactions.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300057

Having been pioneered in the primitive stages (particularly unary and binary catalysis), the field has witnessed the inception of "Ternary Catalysis" described as the concept of harnessing an ensemble effect of three discrete catalysts in one-pot. Although the concept is nascent, it has already demonstrated its invaluable importance in terms of producing novel reactivity, prodigious selectivity, and efficiency. As evident from the presented documentation, the number of pertinent reports utilizing ternary catalysis has drastically increased in the past few years; however, these reports remain scattered in the literature. The conceptualization and unambiguous catalyst-dependent classification presented herein provides an imperative unified approach to assemble and categorize all such reports which have remained missing by far. Special emphasis has been given to mechanistic analysis clearly disclosing the beauty of ternary catalysis. For the better understanding of the concept, a succinct description of challenges and problems associated in the development of a ternary catalytic system has been presented. In addition, the Review briefly discusses some of the unsolved problems and possible developments in this field.									32	0	0	0	4	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300058

The present reaction can transfer an ester functional group from certain aromatic esters to haloarenes. This ester transfer reaction involves two oxidative additions-one from the C-C bond of the aromatic ester and one from the C-halogen bond of haloarenes-onto a nickel catalyst. The utilization of a Ni/dcypt catalyst capable of cleaving both chemical bonds was a key for the reaction progress. Furthermore, naphthol-based aryl electrophiles were also applicable to the catalytic system via C-O bond activation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300059

Reducing the particle size from a few nanometers down to atomically dispersed single atoms alters both the morphology and electronic property of the metal enormously, thus greatly modulating its catalytic performance. Detailed investigation of the particle size effect as well as taking account of a metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), the frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, can provide a deeper insight into structure-activity relations and facilitate the rational design of advanced metal catalysts. However, such studies have been rarely reported. Herein, Cu single atoms and nanoparticles with different sizes of about 3.4, 7.3, and 9.3 nm were synthesized on an alumina support using atomic layer deposition. Comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic characterization shows that the Cu single atoms remain very stable and have 1+ valence state after reduction at 300 degrees C in hydrogen. In semihydrogenation of acetylene in excess of ethylene, we show that a decrease in the Cu particle size reduces the activity considerably but gradually improves both the ethylene selectivity and durability. In particular, the Cu SAC exhibits the highest ethylene selectivity of 91% at the complete conversion along with excellent long-term stability for at least 40 h, in sharp contrast with the rapid deactivation on Cu nanoparticle catalysts. In situ thermogravimetry measurements further reveal that coke formation on Cu-1 SAC is significantly suppressed by up to similar to 89% compared to that on the 9.3 nm Cu nanoparticle catalysts. In brief, our findings demonstrate that SACs can be promising candidates for selective hydrogenation reactions in terms of high selectivity and high coking resistance.									31	3	0	0	0	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300060

Thermal catalysis of ethane to ethylene, mainly oxidative dehydrogenation, faces the fundamental challenge of low conversion, low selectivity, and catalyst coking. This work demonstrates an efficient conversion of ethane to ethylene in a nonoxidative dehydrogenation process in a proton-conducting solid oxide electrolyzer at ambient pressure and 700 degrees C. We show the highest ethane conversion of 75.2% and similar to 100% ethylene selectivity even only at 0.8 V in this electrochemical catalysis process. The electrochemical pumping of protons at anode with active exsolved metal-oxide interfaces enhances anode activity, while the metal-oxide interface interactions further engineer the ethane conversion in the electrochemical dehydrogenation process. We exsolve metal-oxide interface architecture at nanoscale on the electrode scaffold to improve coking resistance and catalyst stability. We further present the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide in the cathode combined with ethane conversion in the anode, and we show the higher performance of ethane conversion in the anode with syngas production in the cathode. The electrochemical dehydrogenation process would provide an alternative method for the petrochemical production and a thermochemical practice in a clean energy mode.									26	3	0	0	0	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000518876300061

This reaction provides stereodefined trisubstituted homoallyl alcohol derivatives that bear a synthetically useful alkenyl silane moiety. The results of a computational study suggested that the silyl directing group thermodynamically stabilizes the sterically hindered allylcopper(I) intermediate and kinetically facilitates the carbonyl allylation path for the linear product by lowering the energy of its transition state.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400008

This zwitterionic amidate is stable yet amenable to single-electron oxidation for generating a highly reactive amidyl radical. In cooperation with an Ir-based visible-light photoredox catalyst, the optimal catalyst enables the efficient direct alkylation of the C-H bonds of various nitrogen-or oxygen-containing organic compounds.									21	1	0	0	5	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400025

A manganese(I) complex bearing a phosphine-free ligand catalyzed the reaction, which involved the formation of two C-C bonds via a sequence of intermolecular- and intramolecular-borrowing hydrogenation reactions. It produces 2 mol of water as the sole byproduct, making the process atom economical and environmentally benign. Multisubstituted cycloalkanes were obtained in good to excellent yields with very high selectivities. A thorough mechanistic analysis by high-level DFT computation rationalizes the choice of the pincer and establishes the role of hemilability of the ligand for this efficient transformation.									25	0	0	0	4	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400024

The terminal oxidant is a stoichiometric amount of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, an environmentally benign reagent. Up to 96% enantiomeric excess and 99% yields were achieved for 1,1'-disubstituted and 1,2-disubstituted allylic protected amines and 1,2-disubstituted homoallylic protected amines. The identity of the ion pair catalyst was uncovered using X-ray crystallography and revealed that the achiral tetraperoxyditungstate anion species [(WO2)-O-2(mu-O)(O-2)(4)](2-) is nudged nicely into the central cavity of the chiral dication. The ion pair catalyst was also characterized using infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 6570-6573). In this work, the related Co(-I) end-on dinitrogen adducts, [(N-2)CoML](-), were isolated and investigated as precatalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The Co-Ga catalyst was highly active, achieving 19,200 formate turnovers with an initial turnover frequency of 27,000 h(-1) under 34 atm of 1:1 CO2/H-2 and using Verkades proazaphosphatrane as a base at ambient temperature. The Co-Al catalyst was moderately active, while the Co-In complex was inactive. Hence, tuning the group 13 ion greatly influences the catalytic activity at the Co site. To elucidate the role of the group 13 support, experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies of the Co-Ga and Co-Al catalysts were conducted. The Co(-I) H-2 species are potent hydride donors with estimated thermodynamic hydricities (Delta G degrees(H-)) of 32.0(1) and 37.4(1) kcal/mol in CH3CN for M = Al and Ga, respectively. By acting as masked Co(I) dihydrides, the Co(-I) H-2 species operate via an unusual Co(-I)/Co(I) redox cycle. After hydride transfer to CO2, the resulting intermediate is the Co(I) hydride complex, HCoML, which was independently synthesized and structurally characterized for M = Al and Ga. The Gibbs free energy for H-2 binding, Delta G degrees(bind) (1 atm), to generate (eta(2)-H-2)HCoML was slightly more favorable for HCoGaL (-4.2(1) kcal/mol) than for HCoAlL (-2.7(1) kcal/mol). In the subsequent step, the deprotonation reaction to regenerate the initial catalyst was much more favorable for (eta(2)-H-2)HCoGaL (pK(a) of 31.4, CH3CN) than for (eta(2)-H-2)HCoAlL (pK(a) of 34.3). The straightforward substitution of Al with Ga perturbs the energy profile of the catalytic reaction (vertical bar Delta Delta G degrees(H-)vertical bar = 5.4 kcal/mol, vertical bar Delta G degrees(bind)vertical bar = 1.5 kcal/mol, and vertical bar Delta Delta G degrees(Ka)vertical bar = 4.0 kcal/mol) and thus provides a thermodynamic rationale for the higher catalytic efficiency of Co-Ga over Co-Al.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400007

Its capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a virulence factor and is a key component in NmW CPS-protein conjugate vaccines. The current clinically used NmW CPS protein conjugate vaccines are effective, but the costs are high and the products are heterogeneous at both the CPS and conjugate levels. Toward the development of potentially better NmW CPS vaccines, herein we report the synthesis of homogeneous oligosaccharides of NmW CPS in a size-controlled manner using polysaccharide synthase NmSiaD(W) in a sequential one-pot multienzyme platform. Taking advantage of the obtained structurally defined synthetic oligosaccharides tagged with a hydrophobic chromophore, detailed biochemical characterization of NmSiaD(W) has been achieved. While the catalytic efficiency of the galactosyl-transferase activity of NmSiaD(W) increases dramatically with the increase of the sialoside acceptor substrate size, the size difference of the galactoside acceptor substrate does not influence NmSiaD(W) sialyltransferase activity significantly. The ratio of donor and acceptor substrate concentrations, but not the size of the acceptor substrates, has been found to be the major determining factor for the sizes of the oligosaccharides produced. NmW CPS oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization (DP) higher than 65 have been observed. The study provides a better understanding of NmSiaD(W) capsular polysaccharide synthase and showcases an efficient chemoenzymatic synthetic platform for obtaining structurally defined NmW CPS oligosaccharides in a size-controlled manner.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400041	33414981

Deciphering the functional significance of these ligands requires a quantitative understanding of how their electron-donating capabilities modulate the structures and reactivities of the iconic ferryl intermediates compounds I and II. However, probing these relationships experimentally has proven to be challenging as ligand substitutions accessible via conventional mutagenesis do not allow fine tuning of electron donation and typically abolish catalytic function. Here, we exploit engineered translation components to replace the histidine ligand of cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) by a less electron-donating N-delta-methyl histidine (Me-His) with little effect on the enzyme structure. The rate of formation (k(1)) and the reactivity (k(2)) of compound I are unaffected by ligand substitution. In contrast, proton-coupled electron transfer to compound II (k(3)) is 10-fold slower in CcP Me-His, providing a direct link between electron donation and compound II reactivity, which can be explained by weaker electron donation from the Me-His ligand (the push) affording an electron-deficient ferryl oxygen with reduced proton affinity (the pull). The deleterious effects of the Me-His ligand can be fully compensated by introducing a W51F mutation designed to increase the pull by removing a hydrogen bond to the ferryl oxygen. Analogous substitutions in ascorbate peroxidase lead to similar activity trends to those observed in CcP, suggesting that a common mechanistic strategy is employed by enzymes using distinct electron transfer pathways. Our study highlights how noncanonical active site substitutions can be used to directly probe and deconstruct highly evolved bioinorganic mechanisms.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400036	32550044

However, less work has focused on the effect of iron-oxygen composition on the characteristic of charge transport and interfacial reaction. Here, we investigated the charge transfer and interface reaction of two typical iron-oxygen compositions of hematite prepared from the precursors of Fe and FeOOH in which different iron-oxygen ratios were obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy etching confirms that different precursors do cause differences in spatial elemental composition after thermal treatment. For Fe precursors, oxygen deficiency in the bulk is responsible for its lower bulk efficiency, whereas the defect-free surface results in a high surface separation efficiency and a low interfacial reaction catalysis rate. The FeOOH precursor forms an oxygen-rich surface and, therefore, introduces a large number of surface hole traps. Excessive traps significantly hinder surface charge separation and transport but favor surface electrocatalytic kinetics. Our work provides a perspective on the relationship between the semiconductor electrode performance and its structure and provides effective guidance for further optimization.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400002

Herein, an effective strategy was developed through the combination of partially reduced Zn-Cr-Al trinary oxides (ZnCrAlOx) and Mo-based sulfides to significantly raise the alcohol selectivity. The introduction of K on Mo-based sulfides suppresses the acid sites and stabilizes alkoxy species (CHxO*), which greatly enhances the selectivity of alcohols. The close proximity of the two components on the multifunctional relay catalyst ZnCrAlOx vertical bar KNiMoS-MMO-5 can effectively promote the migration of reaction intermediates by shifting the DME formation equilibrium on ZnCrAlOx, achieving an alcohol selectivity of 60.4% with more than similar to 72.7% of C2+OH selectivity in alcohols under a CO conversion of 9.8%, and significantly improves the turnover frequency (TOF) of C2+OH (71.9 h(-1)). A plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed on the multifunctional relay catalyst ZnCrAlOx vertical bar KNiMoS-MMO-5. This work provides a promising avenue to improve the selectivity of higher alcohols through a multifunctional relay catalyst affording multiple types of active sites.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400003

To mitigate energy and environmental challenges, renewable ammonia production technologies based on electrochemical and photochemical methods, in particular, photocatalytic nitrogen fixation in aqueous phase for ammonia production is highly desired. In the present work, single-atom Pt anchored at the -N-3 sites of stable and ultrathin covalent triazine framework (CTF) nanosheets have been successfully synthesized (Pt-SACs/CTF). The well-defined coordination structure of Pt-N-3 sites in the Pt-SACs/CTF catalyst have been characterized using HAADF-STEM and EXAFS, as well as ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The ammonia production rate over the as-synthesized Pt-SACs/CTF catalyst is 171.40 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in the absence of sacrificial agent. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, it has been found that the alternating mechanism is energetically more favorable than the distal mechanism over the well-defined Pt-N-3 sites. The significance of the present work is to demonstrate that the single-atom metal catalysts are anchored at the two-dimensional stable CTF nanosheets for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation to ammonia.									48	1	0	0	2	0	48			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400004

Herein, a facile strategy has been provided for synthesizing hexagonal Fe2N nanocrystals dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), through direct pyrolysis of a mixture of carbon black, ferric chloride (FeCl3), and melamine in an argon atmosphere, followed by ammonia activation at 700 degrees C. The obtained Fe2N/NC catalyst exhibits both ultrahigh ORR activity and favorable long-term durability in alkaline solutions, which exceeds the state-of-the-art Pt/C even in Zn-air batteries. Acid etching and KSCN poisoning experiments confirm that the remarkable performances are mainly attributed to the hexagonal nitride with special crystal facets that existed in this hybrid. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that the oxygen adsorption energy of the exposed Fe2N((11) over bar1) plane is -1.14 eV, very close to that of Pt(111). More importantly, at 0.85 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the free energy diagram of the ORR on this exposed crystal facet is closer to the ideal path than that of the Fe-N-4 bonds that existed in this hybrid, suggesting that the ORR process over Fe2N is easier than that over Fe-N-C catalysts. This work may provide an idea for fabricating nitrides or carbides with controlled crystal facets as efficient non-Pt catalysts for hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells or metal-air batteries.									20	2	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400005

However, the heat treatment involved in the material preparation excites Fe aggregating into nanosized species with low activity rather than single-atom Fe sites. Herein, we propose a ceria-assisted strategy to preferentially generate active single-atom Fe sites in Fe-N-C materials, which involves oxidative polymerization of pyrrole, Ce3+ and Fe3+ adsorption, and subsequent heat treatment. Because of its spatial confinement and strong trapping for Fe atoms, ceria can effectively suppress agglomeration of isolated Fe atoms and stabilize the Fe atoms by bonding to O in the lattice during the heat treatment, leading to a high content of atomically dispersed Fe (4.6 wt %). Accordingly, the final catalyst showed ultrahigh ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.915 V and kinetic current density of 7.15 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V. When used at the cathode in anion exchange membrane fuel cell, a maximum power density of 496 mW cm(-2) was achieved, which is one of the best performance reported in the literature for Fe-N-C-type electrocatalysts.									33	3	0	0	0	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400006

Here, we report an aldol-aromatic mechanism composed of aldol, phenolic, and aromatic cycles, that gave high selectivity >70% of a single product, tetramethylbenzene (TeMB) in hydrocarbons, at a reaction temperature as low as 275 degrees C. We evidently found the existence of oxygenated-aromatic compounds in the carbon pool, which remained active throughout the reaction and acted as key intermediates for the formation of the aromatics. The physical contact of ZnCr2O4 with H-ZSM-5 exhibited a strong coupling effect that promoted surface diffusion of C-1 oxygenates (i.e., formaldehyde and methanol) from ZnCr2O4 into H-ZSM-5 and transformed into aromatics via an aldol-aromatic reaction pathway, thus overcoming the most difficult step for first carbon-carbon bond formation. In addition, ZnCr2O4 promoted the aromatics desorption by lowering the desorption activation energy and prevented the oversaturation of carbon pool species. Furthermore, it was found that a combination of thermodynamic equilibrium, surface methylation, and static repulsion are the key factors for giving high selectivity of TeMB in both carbon pool and final aromatics. This aldol-aromatic mechanism will open an efficient reaction pathway to upscale the process for selective aromatic synthesis in high yield from syngas.									7	2	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400009

Sintering of metal nanoparticles on supports affects catalyst stability. To alleviate this problem, a series of highly stable Ru-supported catalysts with controlled metal nanoparticle sizes have been prepared via the easy incipient wetness impregnation method. These catalysts were used for APR of glycerol to produce H-2. Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons (NMCs) were utlized as supports and found to have a strong influence on the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Incorporation of nitrogen in the carbon framework significantly enhanced the catalytic activity compared to Ru catalysts on nitrogen-free supports. Notably, the catalyst (5 wt % Ru-NMC-3) with optimal N content (10.9 wt %) demonstrated improved stability and H-2 selectivity, which are better than those of many state-of-the-art catalysts. Nitrogen in the carbon framework has a dual relationship with the activity of the catalyst: (i) it creates basic environment over the catalysts support and (ii) it acts as an anchoring site for metal nanoparticles. Anchoring of metal nanoparticles has helped to curb their sintering, thus leading to better stability of the catalysts under APR reaction conditions. Various characterization techniques were employed to understand the nature of active catalytic sites responsible for higher H-2 production while minimizing CO formation. In situ CO-FTIR studies showed that the higher catalytic activity of 5 wt % Ru-NMC-3 catalyst was attributed to the enhanced WGS activity over this catalyst. Density functional theory calculations were performed to understand the stabilization of metal nanoparticles by different types of N present on the support and provide insights into the prefered sites of glycerol adsorption on the NMC support. Since S wt % Ru-NMC-3 was the relatively best catalyst, it was selected for the preparation of bimetallic catalysts. Accordingly, addition of Pt to this system helped to increase the stability of the catalyst. This bimetallic catalyst may, therefore, find application for wide use in APR of biomass oxygenates.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400010

Nonthermally oxidized Ir nanoparticles supported on antimony-doped tin oxide (SnO2:Sb, ATO) aerogel allow decreasing the use of the precious metal by more than 70% while enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability. To date, the origin of these benefits remains unknown. Here, we present clear evidence of the mechanisms that lead to the enhancement of the electrochemical properties of the catalyst. Operando near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on membrane electrode assemblies reveals a low degree of Ir oxidation, attributed to the oxygen spill-over from Ir to SnO2:Sb. Furthermore, the formation of highly unstable Ir(III) species is mitigated, while the decrease of Ir dissolution in Ir/SnO2:Sb is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The mechanisms that lead to the high activity and stability of Ir catalysts supported on SnO2:Sb aerogel for PEMWE are thus unveiled.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400011

Two desorption peaks were observed: a peak at 370 K was attributed to molecular desorption of H2O, and a peak at 510 K was attributed to recombinative desorption of H2O. The amount of dissociated H2O adsorbed on the Au/TiO2(110) surface increased in inverse proportion to the second power of the mean Au particle diameter in the range of 1-10 nm and increased linearly with increasing perimeter length around the Au particles, indicating that H2O dissociates to H and OH at the perimeter interface between the Au and TiO2. We also found that the H2O dissociation reaction and the oxidation of CO proceeded at the same active sites. We believe that the oxidation of CO is initiated by the dissociation of H2O. The obtained results provide a deeper experimental insight on a role of H2O in the oxidation of CO over Au/TiO2 catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400012

Herein we report the biocatalytic aldol condensation of acetaldehyde with various aromatic aldehydes to give a number of aromatic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes using a previously engineered variant of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase [4-OT(M4ST/FSOA)] as carboligase. Moreover, an efficient one-pot two-step chemoenzymatic route toward chiral aromatic 1,3-diols has been developed. This one-pot chemoenzymatic strategy successfully combined a highly enantioselective aldol addition step catalyzed by a proline-based carboligase [4-OT(M4ST/F50A) or TAUT015] with a chemical reduction step to convert enzymatically prepared aromatic beta-hydroxyaldehydes into the corresponding 1,3-diols with high optical purity (e.r. up to >99:1) and in good isolated yield (51-92%). These developed (chemo)enzymatic methodologies offer alternative synthetic choices to prepare a variety of important drug precursors.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400013	32117575

In this study, we used in situ dispersive X-ray absorption fine structure (DXAFS) measurements to observe the lattice oxygen dynamics in SrFeO3-delta and Sr3Fe2O7-delta during NO oxidation. The white-line intensities of Sr K-edge XAFS reflect the concentration of oxygen vacancies, and the lattice oxygen dynamics during NO oxidation are observed. Using a kinetics model, the rate-determining step (RDS) for NO oxidation was found to be an oxygen migration step. The activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plots for Sr3Fe2O7-delta is much smaller than that obtained for SrFeO3-delta. Sr3Fe2O7-delta with a Ruddlesden-Popper-type layered perovskite can release oxygen with relatively small structural rearrangements. In contrast SrFeO3-delta requires a significant rearrangement of oxygen vacancies to form the brownmillerite phase and the transformation restricts the oxygen release rate. The oxygen storage profiles with O-2 also show that the RDS is the oxygen migration step, although the dissociative adsorption of O-2 suppresses oxygen storage at low temperatures. The lattice oxygen dynamics obtained from the DXAFS measurements, which cannot be obtained from steady-state kinetics experiments, reveal the importance of the perovskite structure for NO oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400014

This catalytic activity is exemplified by the highly stereoselective preparation of seven branched ketols with good yields.

First, the chain length distribution of the products follows a broad and unselective Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. Second, mostly linear hydrocarbons are formed in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, thus requiring isomerization while manufacturing gasoline fuels. The present paper addresses a synthetic strategy for the preparation of hierarchical metal and zeolite nanocomposite catalysts for direct synthesis of iso-paraffins from syngas. The nanocomposites are synthesized in three steps. In the first step, the parent (core) zeolite is etched with an ammonium fluoride solution. The etching creates small mesopores inside the zeolite crystals. In the second step, the Ru nanoparticles prepared using water-in-oil microemulsion are deposited in the mesopores of the zeolite. In the third step, a zeolite shell of MFI-type zeolites (silicalite-1 or ZSM-5) is grown on the parent zeolite crystals coating both the etched surface and metallic nanoparticles. Thus, the metal nanoparticles become entirely encapsulated inside the zeolite matrix. Most important parameters such as ruthenium content, zeolite mesoporosity, and more particularly, the acidity of the catalyst shell, which affect the catalytic performance of the synthesized nanocomposite materials in low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis were identified in this work. The higher relative amount of iso-paraffins was observed on the catalysts containing a shell of ZSM-5. The proximity between metal and acid sites in the zeolite shell of the nanocomposite catalysts is a crucial parameter for the design of efficient metal zeolite bifunctional catalysts for selective synthesis of gasoline-type fuels via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, while the acidity of the catalyst core has only a limited impact on the catalytic performance.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400016

We demonstrate a method for identifying rate-controlling transition states and species at non(pseudo)steady-state conditions by modifiying of the definitions for degrees of rate control and sensitivities to superimpose the condition that time constants of the analytical rate function are kept constant when taking the partial derivatives of rate with respect to the rate constants/free energies. The utility of transient degrees of rate control is demonstrated for catalytic reaction net-works to rationalize features of the transient rate including extrema and discontinuities.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400017

However, the bulk immiscibility of the two metals, complicating catalyst synthesis, has limited studies of this bimetallic system. We report a solution-phase synthesis for Ni and bimetallic NiAu heterogeneous catalysts. Using oleylamine as a capping agent, an optimized synthesis for Ni catalysts led to supported particles with a narrow size distribution (4.7 +/- 0.4 nm). Gold was added to the Ni nanoparticles via galvanic displacement of Ni in organic solution, the particles were deposited onto commercial alumina, and oleylamine capping agent was removed. The catalytic activity of the bimetallic materials in 1-octyne partial hydrogenation was in between the activity of monometallic Ni and Au catalysts. At high space velocity, the bimetallic catalysts largely maintained the high alkene selectivity associated with Au catalysts (>90% alkene selectivity at a 95% conversion). At lower space velocities, the NiAu catalysts also had a reduced propensity to overhydrogenate the alkene (relative to Ni). A simple catalyst performance parameter, which combined activity, selectivity, and space velocity, was developed and used to describe the overall performance of each catalyst under varying reaction conditions. By this metric, the bimetallic catalysts had considerably better performance than monometallic Ni. The most active bimetallic catalyst was examined with a week-long stability test; it showed no activity loss with a 100% carbon balance. Catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, H-2 and N-2 adsorption, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The reactivity and characterization studies suggest the active catalysts are likely composed of bimetallic NiAu surfaces. The incorporation of Au into the catalysts suppresses H-2 adsorption on Ni, leading to lower hydrogen coverage during catalysis; this contributes to slowing undesirable alkene hydrogenation and improving catalyst selectivity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400018

Here, we demonstrate that this intriguing high activity is owing to the high concentration of Ni cationic vacancy on the nascent ultra-small NiOOH particles (<3 nm). By using first-principles calculations, we compute the thermodynamics of Ni dissolution and clarify the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the gamma-NiOOH surface. We show that (i) similar to 4% Ni cations on the surface of gamma-NiOOH dissolve at pH = 7 and 1.73 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode; (ii) on the pristine gamma-NiOOH surface, OER proceeds via the "lattice peroxide" mechanism (*H2O -> *OH -> *O-(OH)-H-latt* -> O-O-latt -> O-2) with an overpotential of 0.70 V; (iii) in the presence of Ni cationic vacancies, OER proceeds via the "hydroperoxide" mechanism (*OH + *H2O -> *2OH -> *OOH -> O-2) with an overpotential of 0.40 V. Our electronic structure and geometrical structure analyses demonstrate that the structural flexibility at the four-coordinated Ni site nearby Ni vacancy, featuring the ability to bind two terminal oxo species, is key to boost the activity. Considering the presence of the active OOH intermediate, our theory thus implies that the ultra-small oxide nanoclusters with ample cation vacancies could be a paradigm in catalyst design for oxidation reactions.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400019

In biology, respiration uses O-2 reduction as a thermodynamic sink, whereas fuel cells pair the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H2O as a proton dependent half-reaction to the oxidation of chemical fuels. Catalytic ORR processes mediated by molecular inorganic species continue to garner interest as models for heterogeneous systems. The ability to directly observe, quantify, and synthesize relevant intermediates from proposed reaction mechanisms renders molecular species readily optimizable, relative to the distribution of active sites within the nanoscale and mesoscale morphologies of heterogeneous systems. The development of next-generation cathode materials to displace platinum (Pt) for ORR will require improvements in the fundamental understanding of how O-2 behaves as a substrate, which well-defined homogeneous systems are uniquely positioned to provide. This Perspective provides a summary of recent advances in the area of homogeneous catalytic O-2 reduction, with a particular emphasis on improvements in activity and selectivity aided by mechanistic understanding.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400027

The exotic and robust metallic surface states of topological insulators (TIs) are theoretically predicted to enhance surface catalytic activity of overlaying catalysts, but no experimental evidence for TIs directly used as electrocatalysts has ever been reported. In this work, we fabricated the TI thin films of Bi2Te3 with different thicknesses using the molecular beam epitaxy method, and found that these thin films exhibit high electrocatalytic activity in HER. The 48 nm Bi2Te3 thin film has the best performance, which is attributed to its largest active area arising from the spiral growth mode of triangular domains as revealed by atomic force microscopy imaging. Importantly, our theoretical calculations reveal that while pure Bi2Te3 is not a good electrocatalyst, the Bi2Te3 thin films with partially oxidized surfaces or Te vacancies have high HER activity. The existence of the corresponding surface oxides on the Bi2Te3 thin films is supported by our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. We have also made a direct comparison between a Bi2Te3 and a Bi2Te3:Fe thin film on their magneto-transport properties and HER performances. Particularly, this work demonstrates that the topological surface states play a key role in enhancing the HER performance. Our study offers a direction to design cost-effective electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400028

Catalytic reactions using furfuryl alcohol as a substrate were limited by the formation of solid resins with the product yields showing a strong negative correlation with increasing substrate concentration and maximum yields of 1,4-pentanediol and cyclopentanol being 23 and 41%, respectively. A two-level full factorial design of experiments study with four independent input variables (temp., time, [cat.], [substrate]) and a center point was carried out for the conversion of furfuryl acetate, showing good reproducibility between replicates and no humin formation. This enabled a full statistical analysis of the input variable impact on product distribution and yield. The maximum yields of 1,4-pentanediol and cyclopentanol using furfuryl acetate as a substrate are 68 and 35%, respectively. The decreased self-reactivity of furfuryl acetate versus furfuryl alcohol dramatically increases the yields of target products but still shows a strong negative correlation of the yield of the desired products with increasing substrate concentration.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400029

However, it is known that the addition of a small amount of metal-alkyls has drastic effects on the catalyst performance, and it is one of the strategies adopted in industrial practice to tailor the properties of the polyethylene produced. In this work, we conducted a systematic investigation on the effect of triethylaluminum on the Cr(VI)/SiO2 catalyst, with the ultimate goal to determine the properties of the Cr sites at a molecular level and to correlate them to the properties of the obtained polyethylene. To this aim, we coupled kinetic tests, spectroscopic methods (diffuse reflectance UV-vis-near-infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of probe molecules), and different polymer characterization techniques. We found that, at an Al/Cr ratio of 2:1, only ca. 50% of the original Cr(VI) sites are reduced to a variety of species comprising: (1) Cr(IV) bisalkyl sites, which are probed by carbon monoxide and are the major actors in the polymerization of ethylene, explaining the faster polymerization initiation rate; (2) 6-fold coordinated Cr(III) sites, which are not accessible by probes and whose amount does not correlate with the catalyst activity; and (3) two types of monografted Cr(II) sites, all deriving from the over-reduction of the Cr(IV) bisalkyl sites, having, respectively, weak and strong Lewis acid characters, the former responsible for in situ a-olefin generation (and hence contributing to the enchainment of short polymer branching) and the latter accounting for the formation of the high-molecular-weight polymer fraction. Overall, our results demonstrate that the catalytic performance of the Cr sites depends not only on the oxidation state but rather on a combination of molecular structure, acidic character, and nature of the ancillary ligands. Hence, by tuning the structure and acidity of the Cr sites, it is possible to move from a system that essentially affords oligomers from ethylene to one that affords high-molecular-weight polymers.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400032

Furthermore, the robustness of this methodology is depicted by the late-stage modification of estrone and synthesis of vortioxetine. Remarkably, synthesis of more challenging organic materials with large ring tension under milder conditions and synthesis of some halogen contained diaryl sulfides which could not be synthesized using metal-catalyzed coupling reactions of aryl halogen are successfully accomplished with this protocol.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400033

For the latter class of catalysts, iron-doped nickel oxyhydroxide (Ni1-xFexOOH) has shown promise for replacing precious-metal-based catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2 for alkaline water electrolysis. Recently, we used first-principles quantum mechanics to illuminate the precise roles of Fe and Ni in this compound with respect to the mechanism of oxygen evolution. From periodic density functional theory using a screened-exchange hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we identified that the combined abilities of Fe to form an optimally metastable terminal oxo as Fe(IV)=O and Ni(III)'s relatively facile reduction to Ni(II) yield a very low overpotential OER In pursuit of other dopant(s) that can form other such optimal terminal oxos, here we assess the oxygen evolution mechanism and energetics when alternatively doping the beta-NiOOH((1) over bar2 (1) over bar1) surface, a catalytically active facet, with other first-row TMs, namely, V, Cr, Mn, and Co, and some second-row TMs, namely, Mo, Ru, and Rh. These dopants were chosen because their cations are known to form terminal oxos of varying strengths, and some are known to form oxides that are effective OER catalysts. Rather than finding an alternative dopant better than Fe, this study further confirms the unique chemistry of Fe that brings optimal OER activity. Co is found to be a competitive alternative to Fe, with only 0.07 V higher predicted thermodynamic overpotential. More importantly, this study also reveals the strong influence of Ni(III) on the oxidation state of the dopants, in that most dopants investigated could oxidize spontaneously to their respective high oxidation states, while lattice Ni(III) ion(s) reduce(s) concomitantly to Ni(II). Of note, V, Cr, Mo, Ru, and Rh could easily form +5, +6, +6, +7, and +5 TM-oxo groups, respectively. The enhanced stability of these high-oxidation-state cations due to the Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox render these dopants inactive toward reductive elimination of O-2, except for V, and thus we predict that they will be ineffective OER catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400035

Phosphorus can be presented in the fuel gas or as a pelletizing additive to increase the mechanical strength of the industrial extruded monolithic V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst. Herein, we demonstrated that a 2-fold increase in the intrinsic activity without detriments to N-2 selectivity and anti-H2O/SO2 stability can be achieved by incorporating V2O5WO3/TiO2 with a certain amount of phosphorus, which was generally considered as an inhibitor for such type of catalyst. Phosphorus incorporation enhanced both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites on V2O5WO3/TiO2, and NH3 bound to both sites are involved in the SCR reaction but with different rates. The molecular structure of surface vanadyl species was modulated to be more polymeric (dimer and oligomer content increases from 77% to 90%) by phosphorus incorporation through a spatial effect, during which an interaction between phosphorus and tungsten was observed. This study reveals the promotional effect of phosphorus to V2O5WO3/TiO2 catalyst, which is important for the fundamental understanding and design of vanadium-based catalyst.									31	0	0	0	9	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400037

Here, we report a nonoxide/hydroxide material, atomically dispersed dual-metal single sites (Fe-Co sites) on N-doped carbon support, as a highly active catalyst for CO oxidation. It can greatly lower the temperature for complete CO conversion as low as -73 degrees C with a turnover frequency of 0.096 s(-1). X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra, pulse-adsorption microcalorimetry, and density functional theory studies show that the Fe-Co sites synergistically catalyze CO oxidation facilely following the Langmuir Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism with CO preferentially adsorbing at the Co sites and O-2 adsorbing at the Fe sites. These results, for the first time, reveal that the dual-metal single site on N-doped carbon can efficiency catalyze low-temperature CO oxidation reaction without the involvement of supports, such as oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyl groups.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400038		
J	Lan, Xiaocheng; Wang, Tiefeng								Highly Selective Catalysts for the Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Aldehydes: A Review								ACS CATALYSIS				10	4			2764	2790		10.1021/acscatal.9b04331				FEB 21 2020	2020	The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UAL) to saturated aldehydes (SAL) and unsaturated alcohols (UOL) is an important industrial process for producing fine chemicals. More efforts were made on the selective hydrogenation of C=O to UOL, because C=C hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored over C=O hydrogenation. A crucial step toward high selectivity is the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts. In this Review, the catalyst design for the hydrogenation of UAL to UOL are catalogued into three major strategies, namely, modifying electronic properties, forming electrophilic sites, and involving confinement/steric effect. Research works accomplished in the past decade on the catalyst design for UAL hydrogenation are systematically reviewed using the above strategies. The focus is on the selectivity-enhancing mechanism, methods to perform the chosen strategy, and the factors that influence the mechanism. Density functional theory calculations and catalyst stability are discussed to appreciate the challenges in designing catalysts. In addition, recent advances in the selective hydrogenation of C=C of cinnamaldehyde to hydrocinnamaldehyde are briefly reviewed.									54	1	0	0	1	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400040

In situ X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that cobalt was maintained as CoO under a reaction environment when initial Co3O4 particles on SiO2 were below 8.4 nm. The large metallic Co particles can keep a stable size and phase state, indicating almost unchanged catalytic activity and methane selectivity. In contrast, small metallic Co or CoO particles show a gradual increase in methane selectivity with time on stream. Stable large metallic Co particles can be explained as the dominant surface high-coordinated Co atoms having a weak binding ability for H2O molecules, which are more difficult to be oxidized into CoO. It is believed that CoO rather than metallic Co atoms could interact with Si-OH groups to form inactive cobalt silicate (Co2SiO4), which leads to a higher methane selectivity and drives a decrease in the particle size during the FTS reaction. ZrO2 as a structural promoter highly dispersed on SiO2 was found to give a milder increase in methane selectivity due to fewer chances of Si-OH interacting with CoO species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with CO temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD), NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and Py-IR demonstrate that Co/ZrO2 interfacial sites play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity as the electron accumulation in the interface region not only increases the CO adsorption amount but also promotes the CO dissociation on cobalt sites. At the same time, a higher surface C*/H concentration benefits a lower methane selectivity. ZrO2, which acts as a Lewis acid, can adsorb CO molecules abundantly but weakly by the interaction between Zr4+ cations and O atoms in CO. Especially, for the 15Co(C)/Q15 catalyst with initial CoO particles on SiO2, methane selectivity rapidly increases at an early reaction stage, which originates from easier accessible CoO reacting with Si-OH groups. In addition, both 15Co(C)/Q15 and 15Co(C)/10Zr(I)-Q15 catalysts show the dominant CoO phase, which is active in the FTS reaction. Indeed, the DFT calculations demonstrate that CO activation on the CoO(200) surface via the H-assisted CH2O dissociation pathway exhibits a lower activation energy of 1.21 eV compared to that on the face-centered cubic (fcc) Co(111) surface with an activation energy of 1.42 eV, despite that direct CO dissociation, CHO dissociation, and CHOH dissociation on CoO(200) show higher activation energies. This study provides a prime scientific understanding about regulating catalytic activity and methane selectivity.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400042

The vast majority of studies have been performed in the condensed phase, even though condensed phases introduce complex solvent effects and can promote the leaching of active sites. In response, we have built a custom reactor system to understand H2O2 activation and selective oxidation in the vapor-phase. In this report, we study the epoxidation of cyclohexene with H2O2 over four Lewis-acidic metal oxide catalysts: Ti and Nb grafted on SiO2 and on the Zr based metal-organic framework, NU-1000. The M-SiO2 materials are highly selective to the formation of epoxides and diols, as they can be in the condensed phase, while the NU-1000 based materials are far more prone to overoxidation to CO2, which appears to be connected to their strong reactant adsorption. Apparent activation energies are calculated for all materials when operating in the same kinetic regime, and the heats of cyclohexene adsorption into their pores are then used to directly compare intrinsic enthalpies of activation in the vapor vs condensed phase for the M-SiO2 catalysts. Nb-SiO2 catalysts exhibit similar intrinsic enthalpies of activation in the vapor and condensed phases, whereas the condensed phase transition state in Ti-SiO2 is 24 kJ/mol lower in energy than that of the same material in the vapor phase. These experiments establish another methodology for understanding the various roles of solvent in selective oxidation reactions and studying these reactions under conditions that differ significantly from the thousands of prior studies in the condensed phase.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400043

One important route for the production of DHPS is sulfoglycolytic catabolism of sulfoquinovose (SQ) through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (sulfo-EMP) pathway. SQ is a sulfonated carbohydrate present in plant and cyanobacterial sulfolipids (sulfoquinovosyl diacylglyceride and its metabolites) and is biosynthesized globally at a rate of around 10 billion tons per annum. The final step in the bacterial sulfo-EMP pathway involves reduction of sulfolactaldehyde (SLA) to DHPS, catalyzed by an NADH-dependent SLA reductase. Based on conserved sequence motifs, we assign SLA reductase to the beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (beta-HAD) family, an example of a beta-HAD enzyme that acts on a sulfonic acid substrate, rather than a carboxylic acid. We report crystal structures of the SLA reductase YihU from Escherichia coli K-12 in its apo and cofactor-bound states, as well as a ternary complex YihU center dot NADH center dot DHPS with the cofactor and product bound in the active site. Conformational flexibility observed in these structures, combined with kinetic studies, confirm a sequential mechanism and provide evidence for dynamic domain movements that occur during catalysis. The ternary complex structure reveals a conserved sulfonate pocket in SLA reductase that recognizes the sulfonate oxygens through hydrogen bonding to Asn174, Ser178, and the backbone amide of Arg123, along with an ordered water molecule. This triad of residues distinguishes these enzymes from classical beta-HADs that act on carboxylate substrates. A comparison of YihU crystal structures with close structural homologues within the beta-HAD family highlights key differences in the overall domain organization and identifies a peptide sequence that is predictive of SLA reductase activity.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400044

Surface decoration of nanocatalysts with transition-metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) is an effective strategy to tailor the catalytic selectivity but generally at the expense of activity due to the blocking of active sites. Here, we report that constructing single-site metal oxide modifiers (NiO, CoOx, or FeOx), on supported Au NPs by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can regulate their catalytic selectivity for nitroaromatic hydrogenation. The coverage of single-site metal oxide can be precisely tuned by altering the number of ALD cycles. The Au/TiO2 decorated with five cycles of NiO (Ni: 0.32 wt %) in the style of a single site can efficiently change the product selectivity from azo to azoxy compounds without significantly blocking the surface active sites. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the azoxybenzene bonded to the single-site NiO-decorated Au(111) with a larger adsorption energy, which inhibits the overhydrogenation of azoxybenzene and results in high azoxybenzene selectivity. Our work has demonstrated a general and efficient way to regulate the reaction selectivity of metal nanocatalysts by anchoring single-site metal oxide promoters.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400045

Here, we describe a comprehensive experimental and computational study, which reveals an intricate mechanism of this process. The reaction profile indicated azoarene as the terminal nitrogen intermediate formed from the reduction of nitroarene. The activation of azoarene en route to amidation was probed by kinetics, Hammett plots, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The activation likely involves Ni-catalyzed, ZnCl2-promoted, reductive cleavage of the N=N double bond in an azoarene to form a bridging imido species, which then reacts in a rate-determining step with an ester to give an amide. Besides the nickel catalyst, ZnCl2 has an important influence on the rates and orders of the reaction. DFT computations suggest ZnCl2 stabilizes many of the intermediates in the reaction pathway of azoarene activation, including forming the key Ni-Zn heterobimetallic imido intermediate. The mechanistic insights revealed in this study lay the foundation for the development of synthetic methods employing azoarenes as stable and easily accessible nitrogen sources.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400046

However, plasma must be coupled with appropriate catalysts in order to achieve satisfactory oxygenate selectivities. In this article, the mechanisms underlying plasma-catalytic CO2 + CH4 conversion to three different types of oxygenates (CH3OH, HCHO, and CH3COOH) are discussed along the scales of reaction time (ns to ms) and dimension (nm to mm). Particular emphasis is given to the synergy between plasma-phase and surface reactions. In addition, typical materials (both catalytic and noncatalytic) and experimental setups that can affect the selectivities of oxygenated products are also highlighted.									26	2	0	0	1	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400047

The lytic bond of the subsequent rate-limiting step was very elongated in the X-ray structure (1.61 A), which was proposed to be a consequence of the out-of-plane distortion. Here we use high-level QM and QM/MM calculations to study the intermediate destabilization effect. We show that the intrinsic energy penalty for the observed distortion is small (0.2 kcal.mol(-1)) and that the establishment of a favorable hydrogen bond within X5P-ThDP, instead of enzyme steric strain, was found to be the main cause for the distortion. As the net energetic effect of the distortion is small, the establishment of the internal hydrogen bond (-0.6 kcal.mol(-1)) offsets the associated penalty. This makes the distorted structure more stable than the nondistorted one. Even though the energy contributions determined here are close to the accuracy of the computational methods in estimating penalties for geometric distortions, our data show that the intermediate destabilization effect provides a small contribution to the observed reaction rate and does not represent a catalytic effect that justifies the many orders of magnitude which enzymes accelerate reaction rates. The results help to understand the intrinsic enzymatic machinery behind enzyme's amazing proficiency.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400048	33828899

Benefiting from the facile derivatization of porpholactones, we herein constructed a tunichlorin mimic 6 carrying a beta-hydroxyl group ([mesotetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-2-oxaisobacteriochlorinato] nickel (II)), which exhibits significant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate acceleration of ca. 56-fold compared to its porphyrin analogues. Importantly, in the presence of water, the TOF of 6 is up to 6.1 x 10(4) s(-1) with the lowest overpotential, ranking the best among the catalysts described. Coating catalyst 6 on a Ni foam electrode showed good HER performance in a two-electrode alkaline (1 M KOH) electrolyzer (eta(20) = 540 mV). The functional roles of the beta-hydroxyl group on the acceleration of electron transfer and the formation of the hydrogen bond network with water has been suggested in either chemical or electrochemical reductions and H/D kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), combined with DFT calculations. Interstingly, the DFT model suggested that the formation of the hydrogen bond renders more electron density on the Ni center (rho(Ni) = 0.91) in a one electron reduced intermediate [6(H2O)](-), which helps the stabilization of both one- or two-electron reduced intermediates and dramatically enhances the HER rates.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200054

Unlike the previously reported benzylidene phosphite complexes, the benzylphosphite complexes adopt a cis-dichloro configuration making them latent at ambient temperatures. Irradiation with visible light (420 nm and blue LED) prompts activation of the complexes and induces catalysis of olefin metathesis reactions. One of the complexes, cis-Ru-1, was found to be especially suitable for 3D printing of multilayered polydicyclopentadiene structures with excellent spatial resolutions. Additionally, complex cis-Ru-2 was designed with a chromatic orthogonal "kill switch" based on the 2-nitrobenzyl chemistry, allowing the destruction of the catalyst upon exposure to UV-C light.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200038

Recent reports have shown that Ag can also perform the crucial C-H activation step in several of these functionalizations. However, all of these processes are limited by the wasteful requirement for (super)stoichiometric Ag(I) salts. Herein, we report the development of a Ag/Pd cocatalyzed direct arylation of (fluoroarene) chromium tricarbonyl complexes with bromoarenes. The small organic salt, NMe4OC(CF3)(3), added as a halide abstractor, enables the use of a catalytic amount of Ag, reversing the rapid precipitation of AgBr. We have shown through H/D scrambling and kinetic studies that a (PR3)Ag-alkoxide is responsible for C-H activation, a departure from previous studies with Ag carboxylates. Furthermore, the construction of biaryls directly from the simple arene is achieved via a one-pot chromium tricarbonyl complexation/C-H arylation/decomplexation sequence using (pyrene)Cr(CO)(3) as a Cr(CO)(3) donor.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200045	32201633

In the presence of the bifunctional cyclopentadienone iron tricarbonyl Fe4a-d, the hydrogenation of carbonic derivatives proceeds in good yields with good catalyst productivity. Turnover numbers (TON) of up to 3343, 4234, and 40 for the hydrogenation of CO2, hydrogenocarbonate, and carbonate, respectively, to formate in pure water were achieved.

Detailed mechanistic studies were conducted to assess the feasibility of each elementary step, that is, C(acyl)-N bond oxidative addition, followed by base free transmetallation and reductive elimination. These investigations allowed the structural characterization of palladium(II)-fluoroacyl intermediates derived from C-N bond oxidative addition of an amide electrophile. They also revealed the high reactivity of these intermediates for transmetallation with boronic acids without exogenous base. The mechanistic studies also provided a platform to design a practical catalytic protocol for the synthesis of a diversity of alpha,alpha-difluoroketones, including CF2H-ketones. Finally, the synthetic potential of this fluoroacylation methodology is highlighted in sequential, orthogonal C-Br and C-N bond functionalization of an alpha-bromo-alpha,alpha-difluoroacetamide with a focus on compounds of potential biological relevance.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200055

At present, the prevailing perception is that these serve as both a source of electrons and as a source of Lewis acids that may aid CO2 insertion into the Ni-C bond. Herein, we provide evidence for the in situ formation of organometallic species from the metallic reductant, a step that has either been ruled out or has been unexplored in catalytic carboxylation reactions with metal powder reductants. Specifically, we demonstrate that Zn(O) acts as a reductant and that Zn(II) generates arylzinc species that might play a role in the C(sp(2))-S carboxylation of arylsulfonium salts. Overall, the reductive Ni-catalyzed C(sp(2))-S carboxylation reaction proceeds under mild conditions in a non-amide solvent, displays a wide substrate scope, and can be applied to the formal para C-H carboxylation of arenes.									16	1	0	0	3	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200047

The Pd-N-heterocyclic carbene complex/phosphine/borate systems selectively catalyze the addition polymerization of 5-methylene-2-norbornene and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene with the participation of the endocyclic norbornene double bond, whereas the exocyclic double bond remained intact. The catalysts exhibited extremely high activity and durability: the activity was higher than 1 X 10(8) g(poiymer)/(mol(pd).h) and some catalysts were active at a very high monomer/Pd molar ratio of 2 X 10(7) or at a Pd complex concentration of 5 X 10(-6) mol %. The structure-catalytic activity relationships were established for Pd-N-heterocyclic carbene complexes: the Pd complexes bearing five-membered heterocyclic rings and/or less sterically hindered aryl groups at nitrogen atoms in carbene ligands exhibited the highest activity. The polymerization can be performed in an atmosphere of air and in wet solvents. The resulting polymers are amorphous and high-molecular-weight products consisting of rigid saturated main chains and reactive side groups. Thus, they can be considered as promising intermediates in the production of polymeric materials with high glass-transition temperatures and desired properties by targeted modifications.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200002

The present protocol reveals the potential of the deprotonative phospha-TMM strategy for the synthesis of challenging five-membered carbo- and heterocycles, especially those with spirocyclic entities and quaternary asymmetric stereocenters. The choice of the robust chiral diamidophosphite ligand proved to be very crucial for the desired reactivity in the present transformation.

J	Yang, Guo-Hui; Zheng, Hanliang; Li, Xin; Cheng, Jin-Pei								Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Phosphamides via Atroposelective N-Allylic Alkylation								ACS CATALYSIS				10	3			2324	2333		10.1021/acscatal.9b05443				FEB 7 2020	2020	Axially chiral anilide compounds are an emerging but scarcely investigated class of stereogenic molecules with potential applications as biologically active scaffolds. Because of the lower rotation barriers, the synthesis of these compounds is a challenging task. Furthermore, the status of the limited structure type of chiral anilide constrains the latent capacity of the C-N axis as a chiral source in the application of asymmetric synthesis. Herein, we disclose an efficient protocol for the construction of the rationally designed axially chiral phosphamides via atroposelective N-allylic alkylation reaction of MBH carbonates and phosphamides. The simple hydroquinidine catalyst proves to be most efficient in this artroposelective strategy, delivering the desired axially chiral phosphamides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. In addition, a phosphamide compound, which contains both P-stereogenic center and C-N axial chirality, can be obtained by this method through a kinetic resolution process. Because of the large steric diaryl phosphoryl group, the synthesized axially chiral anilide has a large rotational barrier. As a demonstration, current studied axially chiral ortho-iodine substituted phosphamides could act as efficient chiral hypervalent iodine(III) catalysts for the asymmetric oxidative dearomatization of phenols. Moreover, a speculative model, which can explain the enantiocontrol, was proposed based on the experimental observation and theoretical calculation.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200066

However, the detailed catalytic reaction pathways for PLP-dependent enzymes remain to be explored. Methionine-gamma-lyase (MGL), a promising alternative antitumor agent to conventional chemotherapies whose catalytic mechanism is highly desired for guiding further development of re-engineered enzymes, was used as a representative PLP-dependent enzyme, and the catalytic mechanism for L-Met elimination by MGL was explored at the first-principles quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) level with umbrella sampling. The QM/MM calculations revealed that the enzymatic reaction pathway consists of 4 stages for a total of 19 reaction steps with five intermediates captured in available crystal structures. Furthermore, the more comprehensive role of PLP was revealed. Besides the commonly known role of "electron sink", coenzyme PLP can also assist proton transfer and temporarily store the excess proton generated in some intermediate states by using its hydroxyl group and phosphate group. Thus, PLP participated in most of the 19 steps. This study not only provided a theoretical basis for further development and re-engineering MGL as a potential antitumor agent but also revealed the comprehensive role of PLP which could be used to explore the mechanisms of other PLP-dependent enzymes.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200056	33344000

Herein, we report a distinct photoredox catalytic, visible light mediated neutral radical approach. Selective control of highly reactive acyl radical in the energy barrier surmountable, reversible reaction enables driving the formation of deuterated products when an excess of D2O is employed. The power of the H/D exchange process has been demonstrated for not only aromatic aldehydes but also aliphatic substrates, which have been difficult in transitional metal catalyzed H/D exchange reactions, and for selective late-stage deuterium incorporation into complex structures with uniformly high deuteration level (>90%).									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200059	33623725

Pyrazole, thiophene, furan, and indole underwent exo- and trans-selective annulation. Two strained alkene groups of the resulting products were further manipulated to afford 1-alkylindazoles and ladder polymers. The type of heteroarenes and position of halides along with the choice of ligands and bases were critical to set a preference between C-H annulation and Catellani reactions, which will be useful for the development of Pd-catalyzed, NBE-mediated reactions of heteroarenes.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200013

Single crystalline catalysts based upon the o--alkane complexes [Rh(R2PCH2CH2PR2)(eta(2)eta(2)-NBA)][BAr4F] (R = Cy, Bu-t; NBA = norbornane; Ar-F = 3,S-(CF3)(2)C6H3) are prepared by hydrogenation of a norbornadiene precursor. For the Bu-t-substituted system this results in the loss of long-range order, which can be re-established by addition of 1-butene to the material to form a mixture of [Rh((Bu2PCH2CH2PBu2)-Bu-t-Bu-t)(cis-2-butene)][BAr4F] and [RE((Bu2PCH2CH2PBu2)-Bu-t-Bu-t)(1-butene)][BAr4F], in an order/disorder/order phase change. Deployment under flow-reactor conditions results in very different on-stream stabilities. With R = Cy rapid deactivation (3 h) to the butadiene complex occurs, [Rh(Cy2PCH2CH2PCy2)(butadiene)][BAr4F], which can be reactivated by simple addition of H-2. While the equivalent butadiene complex does not form with R = Bu-t at 298 K and on-stream conversion is retained up to 90 h, deactivation is suggested to occur via loss of crystallinity of the SMOM catalyst. Both systems operate under the industrially relevant conditions of an isobutene co-feed. cis:trans selectivites for 2-butene are biased in favor of cis for the tBu system and are more leveled for Cy.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200034	32296595

Because of the intimate coupling between acidity-relevant enthalpies and temperature-relevant entropies, it has been challenging to locate the optimal reactivity zone for a given reaction. Here, periodic DFT calculations combined with microkinetic modeling were employed to investigate the effect of both acid strength and reaction temperature simultaneously on benzene ethylation reaction in MFI-structured zeolites involving both the concerted and stepwise pathways. The acid strength using the adsorption energy of ammonia as a descriptor was tailored by two strategies of the isomorphic substitution of heteroatoms and the introduction of extra-framework cations. Good scaling relations were established between the enthalpies of involved transition states and intermediates and the descriptor of acid strength. We pioneered the revelation a three-dimensional activity plot varying with the acid strength and reaction temperature. Three regions with diverse kinetic trends and two boundaries signifying the maximum activity were theoretically demonstrated in benzene ethylation. Subsequent kinetic analyses rationalized these intriguing properties and indicated that the rate-limiting step actually changes with the acid strength. The results hold broad implications for understanding Bronsted acid catalyzed reactions and developing robust catalysts in the future.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200001

Herein, we report the kinetics and selectivity of Bronsted acid-catalyzed 1,2-propanediol dehydration in pure water and in aqueous mixtures of the polar aprotic cosolvents gamma-valerolactone, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, tetramethylene sulfoxide, and dimethyl sulfoxide at 433 K. We find that the major product of 1,2-propanediol dehydration is propanal in most mixed-solvent environments with selectivities between 1 and 68 mol %. In contrast, 1,2-propanediol dehydration in aqueous mixtures of dimethyl sulfoxide affords acetone as the major product with up to 48% selectivity with minimal propanal formation. We use classical molecular dynamics simulations to probe these solvent effects by computing the difference between the solvation free energies of 1,2-propanediol and propanal in aqueous mixtures of polar aprotic cosolvents and in pure water. We find that the difference in the solvation free energies is correlated with the rates of propanal formation in all mixed-solvent environments, indicating that the solvent-mediated stabilization of the product state relative to the reactant state translates to increased selectivity toward the same product. Similar agreement between simulated solvation free energies and experimental reaction rates/selectivities is established for the acid-catalyzed dehydration of cis- and trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol and 1,3-cyclohexanediol. Finally, analysis of the solvation environment around 1,2-propanediol shows that dimethyl sulfoxide uniquely competes against water to solvate reactive hydroxyl groups, which causes a change in reaction mechanism in this solvent system that leads to the formation of acetone rather than propanal. These results represent a step toward the computationally efficient screening of solvent systems for acid-catalyzed, liquid-phase processes.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200003

All the aminoacrylate Schiffs base structures in chain A are identical regardless of the substrate used to form them. 4-Hydroxypyridine is also in an identical location, except for F448A TPL, where it is displaced about 1 angstrom due to the increased size of the active site. In chain B, we have found different complexes depending on the substrate. With wild-type TPL, L-tyrosine gave no density, 3-F-L-tyrosine gave a gem-diamine, and L-serine gave a gem-diamine in chain B. S-Ethyl-L-cysteine formed an aminoacrylate in chain B with both wild-type and F448A TPL, but perdeuterated TPL with S-ethyl-L-cysteine formed a gem-diamine of aminoacrylate. The kinetics of aminoacrylate intermediate formation from L-tyrosine and S-ethyl-L-cysteine were followed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry at temperatures from 281 to 320 K and hydrostatic pressures ranging from 1 bar to 1.5 kbar at 293 K. There are large negative values of Delta S+, Delta C-p+, Delta V+, and Delta beta+ for aminoacrylate intermediate formation for L-tyrosine but not for S-ethyl-L-cysteine. Formation of the aminoacrylate intermediates from L-tyrosine and S-ethyl-L-cysteine shows heavy enzyme deuterium kinetic isotope effects with perdeuterated TPL that are strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and may be normal or inverse depending on conditions. These results suggest that conformational dynamics as well as vibrational coupling play a key role in the mechanism of the elimination reaction of L-tyrosine catalyzed by TPL.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200004

Detailed pathways were investigated for two steps: (i) catalyst activation and (ii) ethylene and 1-hexene polymerization. For the catalyst activation step, the C-H activation of Cp-substituents (here, the n-propyl group) has also been studied, which leads to another active site named "metal cyclic active site" in comparison to the conventional active site. Among these sites, the formation of a metal cyclic active site is slower with respect to the conventional active site. Additionally, two different routes have been explored for the catalyst activation, depending on the nature of activators, and observed that [CPh3](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-) is a better activator with respect to B(C6F5)(3). Moreover, complete insertion (primary and secondary) and termination (chain transfer to monomer and beta-H elimination) steps have also been studied for both the active sites. These results suggest that the metal cyclic active site can also produce the ethylene and 1-hexene polymer, which defines the multiple site behavior of metallocene catalysts, which explains the broadening of molecular weight distribution of linear low-density polyethylene-produced metallocene catalysts. Along with hafnocene and zirconocene, the toluene-solvated hafnocene catalyst system has also been investigated for catalyst activation and ethylene polymerization for comparison study. These results indicate that the toluene-solvated hafnocene catalyst system is energetically more facile in comparison to other catalysts. Furthermore, the effect of solvents as well as dispersion interaction on catalyst activation steps has been studied for the (Cp-Pr)(2)M(n-butyl)(2) (M = Hf and Zr) catalyst systems and observed that the dispersion interaction played an important role in the catalyst activation process. In addition to this, the regio- and stereoselective behavior of 1-hexene monomer for the (Cp-Pr)(2)Hf(Me)(2) catalyst has been investigated, and it was found that the metal cyclic active site improves the stereoselective nature of the hafnocene catalyst. Therefore, the current chemical calculations provide insights into the nature of active sites in metallocene catalysts for olefin polymerization.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200005

The CO2 hydrogenation reaction is an ideal model reaction to assess the presented technique due to its high exothermicity. Various dynamic experiments are performed in a newly designed reaction cell with an infrared transmitting ZnSe window. In particular, the gas exchange reactions between CO2 and H-2, the coinjection of the two reactants, and the study of the effect of inert gas addition are investigated. Here, we show that the reaction rate on the surface of a catalyst can be localized in time and space by means of infrared thermography. This opens the way to the precise description of reaction dynamics, in particular for reactions operating in intermitting conditions. Furthermore, we show that the combination of infrared thermography with other analytic techniques such as rapid and quantitative mass spectrometry enables a holistic understanding of the transient reaction phenomena.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200007

While catalysts generally sinter and lose activity after aging at high temperature, here we illustrate that palladium in a core@shell morphology responds very differently. After 800 degrees C aging in oxygen, palladium redisperses into the encapsulating shell. The redispersion is more pronounced, and nearly complete, when palladium is encapsulated by reducible ceria, as opposed to nonreducible silica. This difference is likely due to the availability of lattice oxygen. Through comparisons with polycrystalline ceria nanoparticles, surface decorated with Pd, we show that for favorable restructuring to occur under our simple aging conditions, the process must start from a particular initial configuration, the core@shell. Furthermore, the redispersion of palladium in ceria is accompanied by a change in oxidation state and coordination that inhibits the growth of ceria crystallites in the shell, thereby producing sites that better access the reducibility of the ceria shell support. Together, these effects result in a decrease in the temperature required for 90% conversion (T-90) of carbon monoxide. Our findings demonstrate that thermally induced restructuring of core@shell morphologies under controlled conditions provides a strategy for enhancing low-temperature catalytic activity.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200008

Decarboxylative coupling strategies can be divided into two mechanistic frameworks: decarboxylative homolysis processes that generate radicals and decarboxylative heterolysis processes that generate carbanions. The challenge of both inducing decarboxylation with unmodified substrates and enabling efficient interception by a suitable transition-metal complex has made achieving general approaches to catalytic cross-couplings of carboxylic acids elusive. Thus, more wasteful indirect strategies involving preactivation of the acid unit are more common. This Perspective article highlights recent work in the area of metal-catalyzed ionic decarboxylative cross-coupling reactions of unmodified C(sp(3)) carboxylic acids. In these processes, the carboxylic acid unit serves as a surrogate for nucleophiles normally generated by deprotonation or by the use of organometallic reagents. In many cases, this approach can allow for alkylation reactions under less-basic conditions, improving functional group compatibility, ease of access to starting materials, and inhibit undesirable overfunctionalization of products. Commentary on reaction development, mechanism, and application is provided along with comparisons to related transformations.									27	0	0	0	4	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200009

Numerous efforts have been made to enhance the understanding of the heterogeneous copper-based CO2 reduction mechanisms by computational studies. Here we provide a critical assessment of various proposed scenarios of the initial and post C-C coupling steps that result in either ethylene or ethanol. In silico rationalization of the parameters controlling the product selectivity, such as the catalyst structure and composition (Cu facets, the presence of defective sites and/or subsurface oxygen atoms, or the interplay with a second metal) and the reaction conditions (pH, applied potential, and electrolyte), is provided. A comprehensive scheme combining the proposed pathways is derived, and the issues that are still under debate and require further investigations are highlighted.									71	1	0	0	5	0	72			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200010

For the model reaction, the findings support the corresponding disulfide (PhSSPh) of the arenethiol (PhSH) as the active thiolating source under reaction conditions. Synthesis and reactivity studies along with kinetic measurements support the chemical and kinetic competence of catalytically active well-defined Cu complexes: (phen)Cu-I(O2CC6H4-o-NO2) (2), [(phen)Cu-I(mu-SC6H5)](2) (3), (phen)Cu-I(C6H4-o-NO2) (4), and (phen)Cu-II(O2CC6H4-o-NO2)(2) (5) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline). The presence of an induction period in the stoichiometric reaction of the copper(II) complex (phen)Cu-II(O2CC6H4-o-NO2)(2) (5) with PhSSPh and the absence of an induction period in the analogous stoichiometric reaction of the copper(I) complex (phen)Cu-I(O2CC6H4-o-NO2) (2) suggest that a copper(I) carboxylate is a more likely intermediate than a copper(II) carboxylate. The observation of in situ reduction of Cu-II to Cu-I further supports Cu-I as the primary active catalytic species, and spectroscopic studies also indicate the catalyst resting state to be a Cu-I species. The catalytic reaction exhibits a first-order dependence on [Cu-I] and [2-nitrobenzoic acid] and a zero-order dependence on [PhSSPh] and p(O-2), suggestive of turnover-limiting decarboxylation of a copper(I) carboxylate. Oxygen was found to promote the essential oxidative cleavage of the copper(I) thiolate intermediate [(phen)Cu-I(mu-SC6H5)](2) (3) to regenerate a catalytically active [(phen)Cu-II] (Cu-ox) species with concomitant formation of PhSSPh. On the basis of these findings, a reaction pathway is proposed for the C-S coupling reaction that includes the key Cu-I-based intermediates (phen)Cu-I(O2CC6H4-o-NO2) (2) and (phen)Cu-I(C6H4-o-NO2) (4). The pathway accounts for the role of O-2 in generating the active thiolating source, PhSSPh, as well as enabling catalytic turnover of in situ generated [(phen)Cu-I(mu-SC6H5)](2) (3).									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200011

Herein, we reported efficient heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines over chiral porous polymers integrated with both chiral active sites (VDPEN-RuOTs) and substrate activation sites (TsOH). The porous polymer integrated with TsOH is 10 times more active than that without TsOH in the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline. The volcano curve of TOF with the TsOH/Ru ratio confirms the synergistic catalysis of VDPEN-RuOTs and TsOH. Comparison results with a homogeneous catalytic system imply that the synergy between chiral centers and acidic sites is greatly enhanced in the polymer network. Under optimized conditions, the chiral porous polymer afforded up to 90% ee with 90 h(-1) TOF, which is one of the best solid catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation of quinoline derivatives ever reported. Furthermore, the bifunctional porous polymers realized the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation/reductive amination reaction to obtain benzo-quinolizidines. Our primary results suggest that the incorporation of substrate activation sites near chiral centers is an efficient strategy for the synthesis of high-performance solid catalysts for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200012

Prevention of blocking and deactivation of the reaction resulting from carbonaceous coke formation is a major challenge, with alleviation strategies including exploitation of particle size effects, metal alloying and impurity doping. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the activity, selectivity, specificity, and deactivation of size-selected platinum clusters can be controllably tuned by manipulating the local electronic density of the catalyzing Pt cluster via appropriate choice of the support system. We show that along with interfacial particle-to-support bonding effects, electron transfer and charge balance on the supported subnanometer metal clusters, controlling the catalysts' activity, can be tuned by the local work function of the catalysts' support. Control of this materials property was demonstrated through synthesis of ultrathin amorphous silica, a-SiO2, films on single crystals with differing work functions, Pt(111) or Mo(211), serving as supports for the active subnanometer cluster component. The catalytic control factor introduced here, akin to support doping, allows steering of the chemical catalytic activity and may be used to inhibit undesirable catalyst poisoning and coke formation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200014

Here, we advance the understanding of these critical processes by providing insights into the allosteric mechanism of acid-beta-glucosidase, an enzyme associated with Gaucher disease. Glycosylation, a post-translational modification of proteins, is essential for in vivo catalytic activity and stability of acid-beta-glucosidase. Asparagine 19, a glycosylation site that is located, similar to 30 angstrom from the active site, was observed to be glycosylated with either one or two N-acetyl-glucosamines by X-ray crystallography. In addition, N370S and L444P mutations, located similar to 18 and 30 angstrom, respectively, away from the active site, cause type I Gaucher disease that is common among certain demographic groups. Using multiple microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations, we evaluated the dynamics of the wild-type, glycosylated with one and two N-acetyl-glucosamines at N19 and the N370S and L444P variants of acid-beta-glucosidase. Our results suggest that access to the substrate-binding pocket is controlled by the dynamics of loops surrounding the active site and allosterically regulated. Catalytic residues, E235 and E340, are less localized and sample more conformational states upon glycosylation of acid-beta-glucosidase when compared to the wild-type and N370S variant. Our findings could help explain the allosteric effects of glycosylation on enzyme mechanisms, other disease-causing mutations in acid-beta-glucosidase, and facilitate the design of drugs for the treatment of Gaucher disease.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200015

The challenge for the catalytic oxidation of CH4 is that the catalyst must operate in the exhaust, which contains H2O (5-15 vol %) and SO2 (similar to 1 ppm), and both components cause a severe inhibition of the catalyst. Here, we report that a 2 wt % Rh/ZSM-5 catalyst offers great promise by showing that high methane conversion can be reached at practically achievable conditions and high space velocities also in the presence of H2O and SO2. Rh-based catalysts, which are in the form of Rh2O3 under reaction conditions, become superior to the state-of-the-art Pd-based catalysts in an atmosphere with both H2O and SO2. Although both H2O and SO2 inhibit Pd and Rh catalysts, water is found to have a destabilizing effect on rhodium sulfate that enables a partial decomposition of the sulfate below 400 degrees C. We propose that this partly alleviates the sulfur poisoning of Rh catalysts; wherefore, the combined inhibition from H2O + SO2 is weaker for Rh than that for Pd.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200016

The DFT results indicate that the catalytic cycle is divided into four main processes involving oxidative coupling, insertion, 1,3-alkyl migration, and 1,2-alkyl migration or 1,2-H migration. It is found that a Rh(I) Fischer carbene intermediate, which is derived from the third process 1,3-alkyl migration, selectively determines the formation of the six/five/five tricycle Product 1 or the six/five/four tricycle Product 2, depending on the substitutes on the substrates. The origin of cycloisomerization product selectivity has also been addressed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200017

The promotion of MoS2 by K increases the CO conversion rate and the CH3SH selectivity and is usually linked to the stabilization of the 1T-MoS2 polymorph as compared to the 2H-MoS2 in K-free samples. Sulfided catalysts were characterized using TEM, XPS, and EXAFS. TEM showed that MoS2 particles became larger and more stacked when the K/Mo ratio increased above unity. XPS and EXAFS evidenced the formation of the 1T-MoS2 phase at higher K/Mo ratio in addition to 2H-MoS2. The addition of K to MoS2 led to increased CH3SH productivity due to both increased CO conversion and CH3SH selectivity (T = 300-400 degrees C, P = 10 bar). The performance of the most active catalyst with a K/Mo ratio of 2 was found to be stable, despite the observation that the initially present 1T-MoS2 phase slowly converted to the 2H-MoS2 phase during the reaction at high pressure. There is no correlation between the CH3SH productivity and the amount of 1T-MoS2 in K-promoted MoS2 catalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200018

By employing density functional theory calculations, we investigated the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) activity on binary metal borides, a model system of metal borides. To elaborate the mechanisms, molybdenum borides (Mo2B, alpha-MoB, and MoB2) were first modeled; the results indicate that the crystal structures greatly impact the N-2 adsorption and therefore the electrocatalytic activity. Our electronic structure investigation suggests that boron p-orbital hybrids with dinitrogen pi*-orbital, and the population on p-pi*-orbital determine the N-2 adsorption strength. Therefore, the isolated boron site of Mo2B with less filled p(z)-orbital benefits the activation of N-2 and weaken the triple bond of dinitrogen. This isolated boron sites concept was successfully extended to other metal borides in the form of M2B (M stands for Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ta, W). Mo2B, Fe2B, and Co2B were discovered as the most promising candidates with low limiting potentials due to appropriate adsorption strength of reaction intermediates led by moderate p(z), filling. This work provides insights for designing metal borides as promising eNRR electrocatalysts.									51	3	0	0	0	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200019

Herein, cobalt sulfide (CoSx) nanovesicles decorated with iron sulfide (FeSx) heterophases were successfully synthesized by using a metal-organic framework precursor through a solvothermal method. The obtained CoSx/FeSx exhibited much elevated OER activity as compared to pristine CoSx and even most previously reported cobalt-based electrocatalysts, with the overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. As revealed by operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, the electrocatalytically active species transformation in CoSx nanovesicles could be stimulated by the incorporated FeSx heterophases due to the increased average valence state of cobalt and lowered coordination of cobalt sites. As a result, the electrocatalytically active cobalt oxyhydroxides could be more easily formed on the catalyst surface during OER and thus contributed to the highly improved performance. This real-time spectral and electrochemical insight into the electrocatalytically active species transformation may guide the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting from the viewpoint of electronic structure-electrocatalytic activity relationship.									37	4	0	0	2	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200020

The traditional catalyst of carbon-supported AuCl3 is inclined to be reduced by acetylene and lose its activity during the reaction process. Here, we presented the construction of Au-I-N-3 active sites through single gold atom dispersed on g-C3N4 (Au-1/g-C3N4), which shows robust catalytic performance toward acetylene hydrochlorination. The Au species is shown to have Au' oxidation state, and it is coordinated with three nitrogen atoms of tri-s-triazine repeating units, which is consistent with density functional theory (DFT) modeling and XAFS measurements. Through DFT study, we demonstrate that the Au-I-N-3 sites tend to coordinate with HCl than C2H2 in the initial reaction. The Au-I-N-3 sites cannot be reduced into Au-0 oxidation state easily and thus maintain their activity as stable catalytic active sites. The single-atom-site Au catalyst with nitrogen coordination environment and corresponding electronic state provides an efficient pathway for acetylene hydrochlorination reaction.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200021

In this work, several structures of the dimeric Escherichia coli OPRTase (EcOPRTase) have been determined at high resolution, and kinetic measurements have been carried out to obtain the catalytic rate and Michaelis constants. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out, and structural analysis from the X-ray and MD simulation structures reveals conformational changes related to the flexible catalytic loop that establishes hydrogen bond interactions with the pyrophosphoryl group of PRPP. It is proposed that the OA substrate can be in equilibrium in its tautomeric forms. Starting from the most stable tautomeric form, all the plausible mechanisms have been explored by means of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD simulations using the adaptive string method. The most feasible mechanism consists of the proton transfer from the N1 atom of OA to a water molecule and from the water molecule to the alpha-phosphate O2A atom of PRPP. After that, the nucleophilic attack of the Ni atom of OA to the Cl atom of PRPP proceeds to yield OMP and pyrophosphate. The free energy barrier obtained is in very good agreement with the experimental data reported. Analysis of some relevant distances between key residues and the substrates (OA and PRPP) at the reactant state and transition state (TS) of the rate-limiting step allows us to understand the role of some conserved residues (Lys73, Asp125, Lys103*, Arg99*, and Mg2+ ion) electrostatically stabilizing the TS and preserving the flexible catalytic loop in a closed conformation during the enzymatic reaction.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200022

The NiFe-LDH catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an overpotential of 247 mV and current of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the performance of conventional iridium oxide (IrOx) catalysts. Notably, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis using NiFe-LDH as an anode catalyst exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 74.7% for flowing 1.0 A cm(-2) in 1 M KOH at 80 degrees C.

The Mo2C was modeled by the beta-Mo2C (100) surface, and the Pt/Mo2C interface was modeled by the addition of 12 Pt atoms to the Mo2C (100) surface (12Pt@Mo2C). The potential energy surfaces of the Boudouard reaction were calculated on pure Mo2C, 12Pt@Mo2C, and Pt (111) surfaces. CO dissociation readily occurs on the Mo2C (100) surface, but not on the Pt (111) surface, with the former being exothermic and the latter being endothermic. At the Pt/Mo2C interface, CO dissociation is still exothermic, but with a larger energy barrier. The Boudouard reaction takes place on the Mo2C region, where CO2 is formed from a surface O atom dissociated from one CO molecule in reaction with another CO molecule, leaving one C atom on the surface. C adsorption is preferential on the Pt site in comparison to the Mo site. The supported Pt domains can collect the remaining C atoms, facilitating further CO2 formation on the active Mo sites. A Bader charge analysis shows that the surface metal carbon bond is a mixture of covalent and ionic bonds, whereas the surface metal-oxygen bond is ionic. Electron localization function (ELF) and partial charge density calculations agree well with the Bader charge analysis. These computational results are consistent with experimental observations of the interaction of CO with Mo2C nanotube supported Pt domains in the transient regime under far from equilibrium conditions. The Boudouard reaction is an important side reaction, and the unexpected role found for Pt as a carbon collector, with Mo serving as a disproportionation site, provides a unique vantage point for understanding carbon and coke formation on catalytic materials.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200024

Literature indicates that promoting these particles with sodium and sulfur creates an active Fischer-Tropsch catalyst to produce olefins, while further adding an H-ZSM-5 zeolite is an effective way to obtain aromatics. This research focused on the promotion of iron oxide colloids with sodium and sulfur using an inorganic ligand exchange followed by the attachment to H-ZSM-5 zeolite crystals. The catalyst referred to as FeP/Z, which consists of iron particles with inorganic ligands attached to a H-ZSM-5 catalyst, was compared to an unpromoted Fe/Z catalyst and an Fe/Z-P catalyst, containing the colloidal nanoparticles with organic ligands, promoted after attachment. A low CO conversion was observed on both FeP/Z and Fe/Z-P, originating from an overpromotion effect for both catalysts. However, when both promoted catalysts were washed (FeP/Z-W and Fe/Z P-W) to remove the excess of promoters, the activity was much higher. Fe/Z-P-W simultaneously achieved low selectivity toward methane as part of the promoters were still present after washing, whereas for FeP/ZW the majority of promoters was removed upon washing, which increased the methane selectivity. Moreover, due to the addition of Na+S promoters, the iron nanoparticles in the FeP/Z(-W) catalysts had grown considerably during catalysis, while those in Fe/Z-P(-W) and Fe/Z(-W) remained relatively stable. Lastly, as a large broadening of particle sizes for the used FeP/Z-W was found, where particle sizes had both increased and decreased, Ostwald ripening is suggested for particle growth accelerated by the presence of the promoters.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200026	32064142

We demonstrate that the reductive exsolution of metallic Ru from fluorite-type solid solutions Sm2RuxCe2-xO7 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4) yields catalysts with high activity and remarkable stability for the DRM. The catalysts feature Ru(0) nanoparticles about 1-2 nm in diameter that are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the resulting oxide support. The exsolved material was investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS at Ru, Sm, and Ce K-edges), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. In situ XAS-XRD experiments revealed that the exsolution of metallic ruthenium is accompanied by a rearrangement of the oxygen vacancies within the lattice. The catalysts derived through exsolution outperform (stable over 4 days) the reference catalysts prepared by wetness impregnation and sodium borohydride reduction. The superior performance of the exsolved catalysts is explained by their high resistance to sintering-induced deactivation owing to the stabilizing metal-support interaction in this class of materials. It is also demonstrated that the Ru nanoparticles can undergo redissolution (in air at 700 degrees C)-exsolution cycles.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200027

The amidase activity of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) on two different substrates has been studied by theoretical quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, supported by experimental kinetic measurements. The aim of the study is to understand the substrate promiscuity of CALB in this secondary reaction and the origin of its promiscuous catalytic activity. The computational results predict activation free energies in very good agreement with the kinetic data and confirm that the activity of CALB as an amidase, despite depending on the features of the amide substrate, is dictated by the electrostatic effects of the protein. The protein polarizes and activates the substrate as well as stabilizes the transition state, thus enhancing the rate constant. Our results can provide guides for future designs of biocatalysts based on electrostatic arguments.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200028

However, the catalytic asymmetric hydrofluorination remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we describe a palladium(II)-catalyzed enantioselective hydrofluorination of alkenylarenes, by employing sulfoxide phosphine (SOP) as a chiral ligand, triarylphosphine as a secondary ligand, Selectfluor as a fluorine source, and trihexylsilane as a hydride source. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a range of chiral benzyl fluorides bearing different functional groups are obtained in good yields (up to 80%) with high enantiopurity (having an enantiomeric ratio of up to 94:6). Some mechanistic insight of this reaction is obtained using in situ one-and two-dimensional H-1-P-31 HMBC nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a catalytic cycle is proposed.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200030

We identify three mechanistic scenarios involving one or two catalytically active metal centers in the activation of carbon dioxide and use density functional theory to map out the energy landscape for each of the mechanistic steps. Experimentally determined second-order kinetics in CO2 consumption, the formation of CO and CO32- together with an observed order in catalyst of 0.5 determined by cyclic voltammetry using the Bures normalized timescale method, suggest a turnover-limiting CO32- loss through the scission of a bimetallic species. Faradaic efficiencies for the reduction of CO2 to CO of 86 +/- 4% are observed. Given the reaction mass balance, we estimate a Faradaic efficiency from the conversion of CO2 to CO32- of 93 +/- 4%. Our combined experimental-theoretical approach suggests that two sequential CO2 insertions are followed by a rearrangement to produce carbon monoxide and carbonate from two molecules of CO2 at singly reduced catalyst molecules. The disproportionation reaction reported herein combines the power of catalytic CO2 conversion with sequestration and provides a new chemical avenue for the conversion of carbon dioxide.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200031

Herein, we report the design of metal-free C3B/C3N heterostructure through constructing a p-n heterojunction as a potential direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting by combining first-principles and excited state dynamics simulations. Our calculations show that the strong interlayer interaction in C3B/C3N p-n heterostructure provides a large built-in electric field with about 0.4 V/angstrom and strong interface nonadiabatic coupling which significantly accelerates the recombination of carriers with weak redox capacity (similar to 0.5 ps) and retards the lifetime of carriers with strong redox capacity (similar to 4 ps). Meanwhile, the B atoms, serving as Lewis acid sites, are good catalytic centers to trap water molecules. The hydrogen reduction reaction and complex four-electronic water oxidation reaction can happen smoothly on the C3B and C3N surface, respectively, without additional overpotential and cocatalyst. This work not only provides a potential metal-free direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting, but also paves the way to rational design high-performance direct Z-scheme photocatalysts.									37	4	0	0	3	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200033

However, due to a wide range of possible defect structures formed during material synthesis, the identification and fabrication of precise active sites remain a challenge. Here, we report a graphene edge-based electrocatalyst for two-electron ORR-nanowire-templated three-dimensional fuzzy graphene (NT-3DFG). NT-3DFG exhibits notable efficiency [onset potential of 0.79 +/- 0.01 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], high selectivity (94 +/- 2% H2O2), and tunable ORR activity as a function of graphene edge site density. Using spectroscopic surface characterization and density functional theory calculations, we find that NT-3DFG edge sites are readily functionalized by carbonyl (C=0) and hydroxyl (C-OH) groups under alkaline ORR conditions. Our calculations indicate that multiple functionalized configurations at both armchair and zigzag edges may achieve a local coordination environment that allows selective, two-electron ORR We derive a generalized geometric descriptor based on the local coordination environment that provides activity predictions of graphene surface sites within similar to 0.1 V of computed values. We combine synthesis, spectroscopy, and simulations to improve active site characterization and accelerate carbon-based electrocatalyst discovery.									29	1	0	0	2	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200035

The photochemical single-electron reduction of imine derivatives to generate a-amino radical intermediates has emerged as a powerful umpolung strategy for opening up underexplored routes to such amine motifs. Furthermore, these radicals have been shown to engage in a wide variety of chemistry, including radical-adical coupling, addition to electrophiles, and reductive amination chemistry. The concept has also begun to see application to iminium ion intermediates and the extension to enantiocontrolled C-C bond formation.

However, most defects cannot be purified or their numbers gauged, making them too complex to explore the hidden catalytic mechanism. A twin boundary, with well-defined symmetric structure and high electrocatalytic activity, is an elegant one-dimensional model catalyst in pursuing such studies. Here on polished Cu electrodes, we successfully synthesized a series of copper twin boundaries, whose density ranges from 0 to 10(5) cm(-1). The CH4 turnover frequency on the twin boundary atoms is 3 orders higher than that on the plane atoms, and the local partial current density reaches 1294 mA cm(-2), with an intrinsic Faradaic efficiency of 92%. An intermediate experiment and density functional theory studies confirm the twin boundary's advantage in converting the absorbed CO* into CH4.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200037

Unlike a potentially labile alkenyl thiol, an alkenyl thioester is stable and easy to prepare. Powerful catalysis via a cobalt hydride hydrogen atom transfer and radical-polar crossover mechanism enabled simultaneous cyclization and deprotection. The substrate scope was expanded by extensive optimization of the reaction conditions and tuning of the thioester unit. This is a rare instance of thioesters showing nucleophilic behavior.

Nevertheless, a relatively harsh reaction condition (>380 C, 1.0 MPa) led to producing large amounts of CO2 (>40%) and gave a low olefin/ paraffin (O/P) ratio (<10) as a result of significant promotion of water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and overhydrogenation of olefins. In this context, attempts are made here to develop a highly active low-temperature composite catalyst. It was found that a zinc-cerium-zirconium solid solution (ZnxCe2-yZryO4) and a SAPO-34 mixture showed CO conversion, light olefin selectivity in hydrocarbons, and O/P ratios of about 7%, 83%, and 23, respectively, at 300 degrees C and 1 atm. More interestingly, this catalyst showed CH4 selectivity and CO2 emission lower than 5 and 6%, respectively. A combination of experimental, in situ spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation results reveals that doping Ce in ZnxZr2.0O4 greatly inhibits the WGS reaction by increasing the formation energy barrier of carboxylate intermediate species, but increases surface oxygen vacancy concentration of the composite through formation of a solid solution, and as a consequence, improving the catalytic activity for conversion of syngas at mild conditions by enhancing the interaction of CO with the catalyst, which elongates the C-O bond of the HCO* species.									24	3	0	0	0	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200040

In principle, various chemicals can be sustainably produced through (photo)electrochemical reduction using water as a cheap and clean electron source. However, oxidation of water is a challenging task that results in low energy efficiency and reliability issues for the practical application of power- and solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Here, we show that various biomasses including lignin can be used as alternative electron sources. Electrons can be readily extracted from biomass using phosphomolybdic acid as a catalyst for oxidative depolymerization of biomass and an electron mediator at a much lower potential (0.95 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) than water using best-performing but expensive catalysts (1.5-1.6 V). In particular, value-added chemicals such as CO and vanillin are produced as by-products upon oxidative depolymerization of lignin. As a result, this approach allows efficient (photo)electrochemical production of hydrogen with a Faradaic efficiency close to unity at acidic pHs and brings additional economic benefits from by-products.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200041

The combination of a copper catalyst and chiral NHC ligand was efficient for the generation of enantioenriched secondary alpha-borylorganocopper species via addition of a Cu-Bpin (= pinacol boronic ester) species to alkenyl boramides. Subsequent stereospecific cross-coupling of such organocopper nucleophiles with aryl bromides successfully proceeded with a palladium-XPhos catalyst. Using 1,2-disubstituted borylalkenes containing a 1,8-naphthalenediaminatoboryl (Bdan) group produced the corresponding anti-diborylalkanes as a single diastereomer with good enantioselectivity up to 96.5:3.5 er, and subsequent oxidation generated the corresponding anti-1,2-dihydroxyl compounds.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200042

In this work, a facile co-precipitation method, followed by thermal postsynthetic treatment in N-2/air, was developed to synthesize molybdenum-doped alpha-Mn2O3 materials (Mn2O3:1.72%Mo, Mn2O3:2.64%Mo, Mn2O3:32.23%Mo, and Mn2O3:49.67%Mo) as low-cost water-oxidizing electrocatalysts. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) investigations showed the presence of strong distortions in the molybdenum-doped alpha-Mn2O3 host lattice (Mn2O3:2.64%Mo) and an average oxidation state of Mn-2.84. Several test assays demonstrated that these structural features significantly promote the OER activity. Mn2O3:2.64%Mo was found to exhibit very good activity among the series in cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN)-assisted water oxidation with a maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 585 mu mol O-2 m-(2) h(-1), which is a 15-fold improvement of the pure alpha-Mn2O3 activity and higher than the value of the previously reported benchmark Mn-based catalyst, birnessite. The optimized catalyst (Mn2O3:2.64%Mo) excelled through a low onset potential (300 mV) and a promising overpotential of 570 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is only 20 mV above that of the noble metal benchmark RuO2 electrode and competitive with that of the most active Mn-based OER catalysts reported to date. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies demonstrated that the catalytically active surface area of Mn2O3:2.64%Mo is much higher than that of alpha-Mn2O3 for the OER at the applied potential. In addition, stability during 30 h without degradation was achieved, which exceeds that of a wide range of current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Our study provides a facile and effective approach for the preparation of economical and high-performance manganese-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200043

However, understanding the role of defects, such as oxygen vacancies, in controlling photocatalytic activity remains a challenge. Here, we report the use of chemically triggered fluorogenic probes to study the spatial distribution of active regions in individual tungsten oxide nanowires using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. The nanowires show significant heterogeneity along their lengths for the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals. Through quantitative, coordinate-based colocalization of multiple probe molecules activated by the same nanowires, we demonstrate that the nanoscale regions most active for the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals also possess a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies. Chemical modifications to remove or block access to surface oxygen vacancies, supported by calculations of binding energies of adsorbates to different surface sites on tungsten oxide, show how these defects control catalytic activity at both the ensemble and single-particle levels. These findings reveal that clusters of oxygen vacancies activate surface-adsorbed water molecules toward photo-oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals, a critical intermediate in several photocatalytic reactions.									19	1	0	0	5	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200044

The individual components (nanoparticles, chlorozincate-based Lewis-acid, ionic liquid, support) of the catalytic system are assembled using a molecular approach to bring metal and acid sites in close contact on the support material, allowing the hydrogenation of O-containing heteroaromatic rings while keeping the aromaticity of C6-rings intact. The chlorozincate species were identified to be predominantly [ZnCl4](2-) anions using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and are in close interaction with the metal nanoparticles. The Ru@SILP-[ZnCl4](2-) catalyst exhibited high activity, selectivity, and stability for the catalytic hydrogenation of a variety of substituted benzofurans, providing easy access to biologically relevant dihydrobenzofuran motifs under continuous flow conditions.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200048

Activity, Selectivity, and the Importance of the Pt Atoms Arrangement								ACS CATALYSIS				10	3			2131	2137		10.1021/acscatal.9b04805				FEB 7 2020	2020	Herein we investigated the effect of the adsorption of Bi and Pb on polycrystalline platinum (Pt-p) on the electrooxidation of glycerol (EOG) in alkaline media by combining electrochemical, spectroscopic (in situ FTIR), and analytical (online HPLC) techniques. Besides, we used single crystal Pt electrodes to understand the effect of the modification of Pt-p in terms of the atomic arrangements on its surface. We found that the activity of Pt-p increases in the presence of Pb (Pt-p-Pb), which acts by suppressing the pathways with complete C-C bond breaking (to produce carbonate) and enhancing the production of glycerate, formate, tartronate, and glycolate. We also found that Pt(100) and Pt(111) are affected by the adsorption of both adatoms. However, the modification of Pt(110) explains the results obtained with Pt,. This basal plane is highly activated by Bi and Pb and its behavior is similar to those of Pt-p-Bi and Pt-p-Pb, respectively. These results permit the conclusion that the adatoms acts mainly by activating Pt atoms with low coordination, which generally binds the adsorbates more strongly and, in consequence, suffers more from poisoning. The adatoms act by preventing the formation of multiple bonded intermediates, likely through a combination of a third body effect and also to a change in the electronic configuration at the surface of the catalyst. We propose in this work that the higher promotion of the EOG by the adatoms in alkaline media is due to a stabilization of the negatively charged intermediates by the Coulombic interaction with the positively charged adatoms.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200049

The catalysis was either driven in alkaline solution by a visible light sensitizer or in hydroxide (OH-) containing acetonitrile solution using the one-electron oxidized cubane as the sole source of charge. The mu-peroxido structure of the intermediate was established by O-18 isotopic labeling, and its catalytic relevancy and role in the O-2 evolving cycle were revealed by the kinetic relationship with decreasing cubium ([Co4O4](+)) and recovery of the Co4O4 complex.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200050

As the decarboxylation of fatty acids to alkanes is an important transformation in the production of bio hydrofined diesel (BHD) and jet fuel, we herein report the development of a highly active and reusable Rh nanoparticle catalyst supported by a silicon nanowire array (SiNA-Rh) and its application in the decarboxylation of fatty acids to alkanes under mild conditions. More specifically, SiNA-Rh (500 mol ppm) selectively promoted the hydrogenative decarboxylation reaction at 200 degrees C under microwave irradiation (similar to 40 IAT) in a H-2 atmosphere (10 bar) to afford the corresponding alkanes in high yields selectively. The only coproduct observed was carbon monoxide, an important and essential staple for the chemical industry. Importantly, carbon dioxide formation was not observed. Moreover, the aldehydes were efficiently converted to alkanes by SiNA-Rh, and this catalyst was reused 20 times without any loss in catalytic activity. Finally, to investigate the effects of microwave irradiation on the enhancement of this chemical transformation based on the Si nanorod structures present in the SiNA-Rh catalyst, the effect of the microwave electric field and magnetic field in the microwave to the reaction was experimentally investigated, and the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity around the surface of the Si nanostructure was simulated using the finite element method.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200051

Although many experimental and theoretical efforts have been reported, most of the studies focused on the initial cyclization while the subsequent cascade carbocation rearrangement and deprotonation were ignored, which determine the regio- and stereochemistry of the final product lanosterol associated with the function-related structure domains of cholesterol and its relatives. Herein we continue our previous works on the cyclization (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 8693-8696); the mechanistic details of the remaining part of lanosterol biosynthesis, involving three hydride shifts, two methyl shift and one deprotonation, were investigated by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We obtained the complete free energy profile for lanosterol biosynthesis, which is thermodynamically and kinetically reasonable for the sole formation of the desired product with byproducts effectively avoided. We identified some key factors such as electrostatic interactions and CH center dot center dot center dot pi interactions that facilitate migration of the carbocation. We also identified the direct deprotonation precursor, intermediate I, which has been controversial in previous studies. More importantly, we found that the enzyme mediates the energy transfer from the initial cyclization to the subsequent rearrangements through the electric field of the active pocket, which guarantees the fidelity of the enzyme catalysis.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200052

By combining density functional theory (DFT) with supervised machine learning, we predict the CO and hydrogen (H) adsorption energies of all surface sites on the (1 1 1) surfaces of the disordered CoCuGaNiZn and AgAuCuPdPt HEAs. This allows an optimization for the HEA compositions with increased likelihood for sites with weak hydrogen adsorption to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen and with strong CO adsorption to favor the reduction of CO. As opposed to the construction of specific arrangements of surface atoms, our approach makes the desired surface sites more frequent through an increase in their probability. This leads to the unbiased discovery of several catalyst candidates for which selectivity toward highly reduced carbon compounds is expected and of which some have been verified in the literature.									55	1	0	0	3	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200053

The rutile phase of TiO2 was found to be inactive due to its relatively low reducibility and surface area. The anatase phase, however, was active. Also, a mixture of anatase and rutile, with an excess of rutile, favored the formation of octene isomers during the oxidative activation of alkane. The favorable activity of TiO2 with an excess of the rutile phase was attributed to its enhanced redox properties brought about by the disorder of the TiO2 lattice at the anatase rutile junction.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200057

Generally, their high surface areas, size, shape, porosity, and the possibility of incorporating additional moieties through chemical functional designs are believed to be essential for enriching the catalytic activity of carbon-containing materials. Lately, the new field of single-atom catalysts (SACs) has emerged as the finest alternative for not only homogeneous but also heterogeneous catalysts used in various kinds of catalytic applications. Among a variety of SACs, carbon-based SACs are widely investigated catalysts because of their extraordinary features such as tunable morphologies, ordered porosity, and effortless immobilization through various metals (noble and non-noble), making them highly efficient single-atom catalysts for numerous important catalytic applications. Herein, we intend to report on the progress achieved in researching carbon-based single-atom catalysts, including primarily metals such as Co, Cu, Zn, Pd, Ni, Pt, among others, embedded in carbon matrices and applied to applications in organic catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis. It is important to point out that the main focus of this Review is directed to the activity and applications of single atom catalysts, which are discussed in detail; thus, characterization and rationalization are excluded. Finally, we provide a future perspective on the development and progress made on a carbon-based single metal atom for catalysis.									113	1	0	0	6	0	113			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200060

Recent revolutions made in data science could have a great impact on traditional catalysis research in both industry and academia and could accelerate the development of catalysts. Machine learning (ML), a subfield of data science, can play a central role in this paradigm shift away from the use of traditional approaches. In this review, we present a user's guide for ML that we believe will be helpful for scientists performing research in the field of catalysis and summarize recent progress that has been made in utilizing ML to create homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The focus of the review is on the design, synthesis, and characterization of catalytic materials/compounds as well as their applications to catalyzed processes. The ML technique not only enhances ways to discover catalysts but also serves as a powerful tool to establish a deeper understanding of relationships between the properties of materials/compounds and their catalytic activities, selectivities, and stabilities. This knowledge facilitates the establishment of principles employed to design catalysts and to enhance their efficiencies. Despite such advantages of ML, it is noteworthly that the current ML-assisted development of real catalysts remains in its infancy, mainly because of the complexity of catalysis associated with the fact that catalysis is a time dependent dynamic event. In this review, we discuss how seamless integration of experiment, theory, and data science can be used to accelerate catalyst development and to guide future studies aimed at applications that will impact society's need to produce energy, materials, and chemicals. Moreover, the limitations and difficulties of ML in catalysis research originating from the complex nature of catalysis are discussed in order to make the catalysis community aware of challenges that need to be addressed for effective and practical use of ML in the field.									88	2	0	0	2	0	89			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200061

Calcination of Na6V10O28/SiO2 in air at 600 degrees C leads to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8, interacting with the silica support, and the metastable polymorph of sodium metavanadate, beta-NaVO3. The formation of beta-NaVO3 at this temperature is unexpected as beta-NaVO, supported on silica and calcined at the same conditions transforms into alpha-NaVO3. At 450 degrees C (temperature of the ODP reaction) in an inert atmosphere, Na6V2O28/SiO2 transforms predominantly to the reduced phase alpha'-NaV2O5 that displays poor activity in ODP. However, the deactivated material recovers the high activity of calcined Na6V10O28/SiO2 after ca. 3 h time on stream (TOS) or after 1 h in air (450 degrees C). This observation is consistent with the proposed link between the high catalytic activity in ODP and the reducibility of a V phase as neither the catalytic performance nor characteristic Raman bands of alpha-NaVO3/SiO2 and [VO4]/SiO2 change significantly in an inert atmosphere at 450 degrees C. Vanadium K-edge operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and in situ Raman mapping show that the oxidation of alpha'-NaV2O5 to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8 and beta-NaVO3 occurs under ODP conditions within several minutes. In contrast, the initial activity recovers within hours (depending on the conditions), and it is explained mostly by slow redispersion of the Na1+xV3O8 phase on SiO2.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200064

The steady-state kinetics shows that SCR reactions involving NO2 proceed much more rapidly than those of NO. Data from in situ IR combined with online mass spectrometry under transient conditions demonstrate that Bronsted acid sites (BASs) promote the reaction of NO2 with NH3 to form N-2, H2O, and NH4NO3 at low temperatures (50-150 degrees C). In combination with DFT results, these data suggest that NO promotes the reduction of NH4NO3 to NRINO2, which then decomposes into N-2 and H2O. Therefore, the accumulation of NH4NO3 in the zeolite is inhibited by NO. Furthermore, when NO is absent, NH4NO3 decomposition into N2O and H2O occurs only at high temperatures (>200 degrees C). A comparison of H-AFX and Cu-AFX implies that Cu sites are not active for the reduction of NO2 by NH3 and that BASs are responsible for the NH3-SCR reactions involving NO2.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200067

Several effects, such as strong local electromagnetic fields, increased electron and lattice temperatures, or the transfer of nonthermal charge carriers, could contribute to the reaction rate enhancement. In order to understand plasmon-enhanced catalysis and to enable plasmonic platforms, a distinction between the different underlying effects is required. We investigate the electrochemical model reactions oxidative hydroxide adsorption and glucose oxidation and deconvolve the enhancement processes via their dependence on the excitation wavelength. We observe that nonthermal effects contribute significantly to the plasmonic enhancement.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200068

The state of this automation and the degree to which it may contribute to speeding up development of catalysts are the subject of this Perspective. We also consider the main challenges associated with automated catalyst design, in particular the generation of promising and chemically realistic candidates, the tradeoff between accuracy and cost in estimating the catalytic performance, the opportunities associated with automated generation and use of large amounts of data, and even how to define the objectives of catalyst design. Throughout the Perspective, we take a cross-disciplinary approach and evaluate the potential of methods and experiences from fields other than homogeneous catalysis. Finally, we provide an overview of software packages available for automated in silico design of homogeneous catalysts.									45	0	0	0	4	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200069

However, the integration of colloidal metal NPs and catalyst supports remains challenging. We report a general protocol, antisolvent-induced adsorption, to deposit colloidal metal NPs onto a broad range of catalyst supports with great uniformity. The choice of antisolvent is dependent on the type of ligand and solvent employed in metal NP synthesis. This protocol may provide a bridge between the fields of colloidal science and heterogeneous catalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200070

Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attempted as ODS catalysts. However, the studies found that most of the MOFs were less active in ODS reactions mainly due to the lack of defect sites in the structure. Therefore, the synthesis of MOFs with defect sites has been pursued. Herein, porous titanium terephthalate with rich defect sites can be prepared with the assistance of acetic acid by the solvothermal method. The obtained material exhibited not only extraordinary ODS activity for the removal of DBT (87.1 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) in model oil at room temperature but also simultaneously the strong ability of separating the sulfone product from the oil phase with a total sulfur removal content of 117 mg S/g catalyst when the concentration of 500 ppmw S in model oil was used. Such good catalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the creation of rich defect sites, high surface area, and the exposure of abundant active sites in the structure of the porous titanium terephthalate.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000513099200071

Herein, we report a combined computational and experimental study on the mechanism and catalytic activity of the ylide-substituted phosphine Cy3P-C(Me)PCy2 (keYPhos, L1) in C-N coupling reactions including a comparison with the established and often-applied phosphines (Cy)JohnPhos (L2) and P(tBu)(3) (L3). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with the possible isolation of several intermediates within the catalytic cycle demonstrate that L1 readily forms low-coordinated palladium complexes [such as L1.Pd(dba)], which easily undergo oxidative addition and subsequent amine coordination as well as reductive elimination. Due to the possible opening and closing of the P-C-P angle in L1, the steric bulk can be adjusted to the metal environment so that L1 retains its conformation throughout the whole catalytic cycle, thus leading to fast catalysis at room temperature. Comparative studies of the three ligands with Pd(2)dba(3) as a Pd source show that only L1 efficiently allows for the coupling of aryl chlorides at room temperature. DFT studies suggest that this is mainly due to the reluctance/inability of L2 and L3 to form the catalytically active species under these reaction conditions. In contrast, the YPhos ligand readily forms the prereactive complex and undergoes the first oxidative addition reaction. These observations are confirmed by kinetic studies, which indicate a short induction period for the formation of the catalytically active species of L1, followed by fast catalysis. This behavior of L1 is due to its unique electronic and steric properties, which support low activation barriers and fast catalyst generation.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700008	32030314

The reactions effectively deliver alpha-alkylated ketones and alpha-alkylated N-acyl ketimines, and it is difficult to prepare the latter by other methods in a stereoselective manner. The alpha-alkylated N-acyl ketimine products can be further subjected to chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric reduction with Hantzsch ester to deliver chiral N-acyl-protected alpha-arylated aliphatic amines in high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee, thus providing a method for facile synthesis of chiral alpha-arylated aliphatic amines, which are of importance in medicinal chemistry research. The N-acetyl ketimine product also reacted smoothly with various types of Grignard reagents to afford sterically bulky N-acetyl alpha-tertiary amines in high yields. Theoretical studies in combination with experimental investigation provide understanding of the reaction mechanism with respect to the dual ligand effect and the irradiation effect in the catalytic cycle. The reaction is suggested to proceed via a hybrid alkyl Pd(I)-radical species generated by inner-sphere electron transfer of phosphine-coordinated Pd(0) species with alkyl bromide. This intriguing hybrid alkyl Pd(I)-radical species is elucidated by theoretical calculation to be a triplet species coordinated by three phosphine atoms with a distorted tetrahedral geometry, and spin prohibition rather than metal-to-ligand charge transfer contributes to the kinetic stability of the hybrid alkyl Pd(I)-radical species to impede alkyl recombination to generate Pd(II) alkyl intermediate.									20	0	0	0	8	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700037

An 8-aminoquinoline auxiliary was utilized to increase the reactivity of the alkene and control the regioselectivity via the formation of thermodynamically favored five-membered palladacycle intermediate. 3-Alkene carboxamides bearing a C4-substituted alkene group reacted with a variety of terminal alkynes in the presence of an ortho-phenyl benzoic acid promoter, yielding ?-alkynylated products with high yields and regioselectivity. 3-Butenamide underwent a three-component coupling reaction with internal alkynes and carboxylic acids to give vinyl ester products. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the intramolecular migratory insertion of alkynyl or vinyl palladium species into the C=C bond is responsible for the gamma-selective alkynylation or alkenylation of the alkene group.									22	0	0	0	5	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700003

While Feu dependent enzymes are often oxygen sensitive, variants of this halogenase could be screened in lysates under aerobic conditions. The developed biocatalysts offer a route to mild, late-stage chlorination on milligram scale of non-natural hapalindoles containing a ketone instead of an isonitrile functionality, thereby unlocking them for preparative biocatalysis.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700031

The practicability of this reaction was validated in the straightforward synthesis of axially chiral biaryl monophosphine ligand and demonstrated by a 100-g-scale synthesis.

A variety of relatively large heterocycles 3 featuring a stereogenic trifluoromethylated carbon center, an amino group, as well as an alkenyl and a carbonate moiety were obtained. An X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed a unique 3D architecture of the products that affords an attractive chemical space. Whereas the method can be applicable for nonfluorinated substrates, the trifluoromethyl group plays a vital role in this unexpected Pd-catalyzed nondecarboxylative ring expansion.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700051

Group 6 molecular compounds remain underexplored in this context relative to other transition metals. Here, we present a molecular chromium complex with a 2,2'-bipyridine-based ligand capable of selectively transforming CO2 into CO with phenol as a sacrificial proton donor at turnover frequencies of 5.7 +/- 0.1 s(-1) with a high Faradaic efficiency (96 +/- 8%) and a low overpotential (110 mV). To achieve the reported catalytic activity, the parent Cr(III) species is reduced by two electron equivalents, suggesting an approximate d(5) active species configuration. Although previous results have suggested that low-valent species from the Cr/Mo/W triad are nonprivileged for CO2 reduction in synthetic molecular systems, the results presented here suggest that reactivity analogous to late transition metals is possible with early transition metals.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700019

Unlike the typical P450 enzymes for hydroxylation, CYP121 is believed to behave like a peroxidase and conduct radical-mediated C-C bond formation. Here, we probe whether the phenolic hydrogen of the substrate is the site of the postulated hydrogen atom abstraction for radical formation. We synthesized a singly O-methylated substrate analogue, cYF-4-OMe, and characterized its interaction with CYP121 by ultraviolet-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography. We found that cYF-4-OMe can function as a substrate of CYP121 using the established assay via the peroxide shunt. Analysis of the enzymatic reaction revealed an O-demethylation of cYF-4-OMe instead of cyclization, yielding cYY and formaldehyde. A hydroxylated substrate, cYF-4-OMeOH, is expected to be the intermediate product, which was trapped and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. We further determined that the deformylation reaction of cYF-4-OMeOH proceeds via an alkyl-oxygen rather than aryl-oxygen bond cleavage by the O-18-labeling studies. Finally, the pH dependence catalytic study on the native substrate and the methoxy analogue further supports the mechanistic understanding that the hydrogen atom abstraction is the critical first oxidation step exerted by a heme-based oxidant during the cyclization reaction of cYY. The switch in catalytic activity reveals the power of CYP121 as a P450 enzyme and provides insight into the peroxidase-like catalytic mechanism.									8	1	0	0	3	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700067	32391185

Because the wild-type enzyme is limited to acetic and propionic derivatives as the substrate, variants were designed to extend the substrate scope of this enzyme. By rational protein engineering, the key residue in the active site was identified which can be replaced to allow binding of bulkier acyl moieties.

Here, an important piece of progress is demonstrated for the oxidative coupling of methane. A high-throughput screening instrument is developed for enabling an automatic performance evaluation of 20 catalysts in 216 reaction conditions. This affords an oxidative coupling of methane dataset comprised of 12 708 data points for 59 catalysts in three successive operations. Based on a variety of data visualization analysis, important insights into catalysis and catalyst design are successfully extracted. In particular, the simultaneous optimization of the catalyst and reactor design is found to be essential for improving the C-2 yield.

However, the leaching of active metals (e.g., Co, Rh) during the hydroformylation reaction seriously hinders the development of heterogeneous catalysts. Suppressing metal leaching with the use of an effective protectant is a possible solution to this problem. In this work, Co leaching was suppressed by the addition of suitable protectants (e.g., citric acid, oxalic acid, and formic acid), thus providing a stable heterogeneous catalytic system. In situ Fourier transform infrared proved that toluene and 1-hexene can promote the solvation of Co carbonyls because of the solvent effect. In contrast, formic acid can be converted to formate species (HCOO) on the surface of Co and effectively suppress the formation of Co carbonyls. Theoretical calculations further proved that high CO coverage on the surface of Co leads to the formation of Co carbonyl species. Furthermore, carboxyl radicals resulting from the dissociation of the O-H bonds of organic acids exhibit strong adsorption on the surface of Co. The intrinsic role of the protectants in suppressing metal leaching is attributed to the decreased CO coverage on the surface of Co by competitive adsorption.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700001

However, no direct observation of the impact of the mass transport on the adsorbed CO coverage on Cu, and in turn the CORR activity, has been reported because of the lack of suitable experimental techniques. In this work, we employ operando surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy with and without stirring to investigate the CO binding sites at potentials relevant to the CORR and correlate with reactivity studies. The significant loss in CO peak intensity observed in the spectra at below -0.6 V without stirring highlights the importance of including forced convection in spectroscopic studies to obtain information representative of typical reaction conditions. Despite roughly 1 order of magnitude lower CO coverage on Cu at -0.7 V without stirring, as compared to the case with stirring, the relative distribution of CORR products does not change appreciably, suggesting that adsorbed CO on Cu exists in patches rather than distributing uniformly.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700004

Although it has been reported that the addition of La to Al2O3 results in improved thermal stability to retain high specific surface areas, its effect on the catalytic reduction of NOx (DeNO(x)) has not been studied systematically. Herein, we describe the role of La in La/Al2O3-supported Pd catalysts (Pd/La/Al2O3) for TWC reactions. For that purpose, we employed various in situ spectroscopic studies, including infrared (IR), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The obtained results revealed that Pd-0 species supported on La/Al2O3 are more electron-deficient compared to those on pristine Al2O3 without La(Pd/Al2O3). Kinetic studies using powdered catalysts revealed that the addition of La suppresses the poisoning effect by CO during the DeNO(x) reactions. In addition to the catalytic tests with powdered catalysts, monolithic honeycomb forms of the catalysts were prepared and employed for TWC reactions, which showed that Pd/La/Al2O3 exhibits higher DeNO(x) activity than Pd/Al2O3. In this study, we also reexamined the effective loading amount of La, which has traditionally been similar to 3-5 wt % of La for TWC processes in order to retain the high specific surface area of the La/Al2O3 supports. Our investigations showed that an increased La loading (15 wt %) is even more effective for the DeNO(x) reactions tested in this study due to the higher reactivity toward NO and the greater suppression of the poisoning effect of CO. The developed catalyst Pd/La(15)/Al2O3 has also been tested in a commercial vehicle and has been evaluated on a practical driving mode test cycle (LA-4; city cycle of U.S. Federal and California), where it showed a better catalytic performance than the conventionally used Pd/La(3-5)/Al2O3 catalysts. Our study suggests that the loading amount of La in Pd/La/Al2O3 catalysts needs to be adjusted depending on the application systems, considering not only the support stability (surface areas) but also the promotional effect in the TWC process.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700009

However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in mBiVO(4) have impeded the improvement of its photocatalytic performance and stability. Therefore, important issues are increasingly focused on fine-tuning the physicochemical properties of mBiVO(4) at the atomic level based on facet-engineered surface and interface design to optimize its selectivity and activity. Herein, the review begins with the fundamental aspects of mBiVO(4) semiconductor, including crystal structure, optical properties, electronic structure, and photocatalytic principles. Then the synthetic methods based on surface and interface design that develop to tailor the facet of mBiVO(4), along with the discussion of the mechanisms for facet-dependent photocatalytic performance, are presented. Most importantly, the latest advances in facet engineering that have been performed to regulate the surface of single mBiVO(4) and to design the interface structures that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reaction for mBiVO(4)-based composites are encompassed. Moreover, the photocatalytic application achievements with mBiVO(4) as photocatalysts in energy conversion and environmental remediation are also summarized. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and future research directions for this emerging frontier are discussed.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700010

Late-transition-metal-catalyzed intermolecular couplings of nucleophiles and 1,3-dienes in hydrofunctionalization reactions have quickly emerged as a compelling approach to these and related compounds. In this Perspective, we illustrate how these intermolecular diene hydrofunctionalizations have provided an avenue to complex, highly desirable chemical space that is not readily accessed by other technologies. We also aim to provide some insight into the varying mechanistic pathways and nuances of these myriad reactions to help inform future reaction and catalyst design.									37	2	0	0	13	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700011

However, due to the inertness of N equivalent to N covalent triple bonds, this process remains a huge challenge to achieve a high yield rate of NH3. In this work, we designed an effective approach to promoting N-2 activation by introducing oxygen vacancies into LaCoO3. In N-2 electroreduction, LaCoO3 with oxygen vacancies (denoted as V-o-LaCoO3) exhibited a Faradaic efficiency of 7.6% for NH3 at -0.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Notably, at -0.7 V versus RHE, the yield rate for NH3 of V-o-LaCoO3 reached 182.2 mu g(NH3) mg(cat)(-1). h(-1), which was 2.8 times higher than that (65.3 mu g(NH3) mg(-1) h(-1)) of pristine LaCoO3. To the best of our knowledge, the yield rate for NH3 of V-o-LaCoO3 approaches the activities of the state-of-the-art catalysts toward N-2 electroreduction. Density functional theory calculations revealed that enhanced activation of N-2 over V-o-LaCoO3 originated from the increased charge density around the valence band edge via the introduction of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the analysis of the thermodynamic limiting potentials for N-2 reduction and H-2 evolution demonstrated the higher selectivity for N-2 electroreduction over V-o-LaCoO3 relative to pristine LaCoO3.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700012

However, during the preparation of single-atom catalysts, some metal nanoparticles (NPs) are inevitably generated, which suffer from low selectivity in CO2RR. In this regard, complex postprocessing solution treatments are usually conducted to remove metal NPs using acid. Herein, we fabricated Ni(NC)-based catalysts composed of single Ni atoms and Ni NPs, both of which feature local Ni-N coordination via a simple Ni-metal organic framework (MOF)-assisted strategy. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements, nitrogen species in N-doped carbon have been demonstrated to be coordinated with surface nickel species to form Ni-N motifs, which makes Ni at a low-valent state for efficient CO2RR. Consequently, the catalyst exhibited high performances toward CO2RR with CO Faradic efficiencies (FECO) maintained over 90% from -0.65 to -0.90 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). More importantly, the FECO of 99% could be obtained at a considerable current density (j) of -160 mA cm(-2) in a flow cell configuration. These findings suggest that regulating the surface environment of Ni species can activate the original inert reaction sites into active reaction sites, providing a promising avenue to design high-performance electrocatalysts for CO2RR.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700013

Structure-activity correlations reveal polymorphic changes of the rhombohedral LaNiO3 structure first into cubic LaNiO3 and further into transient oxygen-deficient triclinic LaNiO2.7 and monoclinic LaNiO2.5. These changes occur up to 620 degrees C and already cause considerable DRM activity. Another intermediate structure, the Ruddlesden-Popper phase La2NiO4 with moderate DRM activity, is formed in parallel with the decomposition of monoclinic LaNiO2.5. The decay of La2NiO4 directly goes along with the appearance of crystalline metallic Ni and monoclinic La2O2CO3 and a drastic enhancement of DRM activity. The formation of monoclinic La2O2CO3 and decomposition of La2NiO4 proceed exactly alike up to 670 degrees C with the accumulation of metallic Ni. At 670 degrees C and up to 750 degrees C, monoclinic La2O2CO3 is directly transformed into hexagonal La2O2CO3, and no further Ni exsolution is observed. Only above 750 degrees C, hexagonal La2O3 is observed and apparently formed directly from a drastically accelerated decomposition of monoclinic La2O2CO3 alongside another small increase in metallic Ni. Our direct structure-activity correlation unambiguously shows that the active phase in DRM is a mixture of metallic Ni in contact with monoclinic La2O2CO3. The roles of the latter phase are twofold: acting as the CO2-activated species and stabilizing the metallic Ni particles. Naturally, this implies a perfect carbon removal ability of the metallic Ni/La2O2CO3 interface, which directly relates to an enhanced coking resistance and, most probably, long term stability. Heating LaNiO3 in hydrogen yields a similar sequence of structural transformations with the striking difference of the missing transient La2NiO4 structure, corroborating its crucial role in the formation of the DRM-active Ni/monoclinic La2O2CO3 interface. The final structural fate is a metallic Ni/hexagonal La2O3 phase mixture. Exemplified for the DRM reaction and the initial LaNiO3 structure, only the knowledge about the sheer complexity of the structural dynamics allows the unequivocal assignment of participating structures and phases to their respective catalytic performance, and therefore, allows definite conclusions about the formation and the properties of the final active phase.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700015

Vulcan XC-72-supported Pt(3 wt %)Au(3 wt %)Sn(10 wt %) is used as a reference (PtAuSn/C). For a better understanding of the reaction mechanism, in situ techniques such as electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) are employed. We show that PtAuSn/W2C has a higher electrocatalytic performance than PtAuSn/C, with a CO2 conversion efficiency of 6.5% detected at 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at room temperature with on-line quantitative EC-MS measurements. FTIR spectra analysis and EC-MS during the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) show C-C bond breaking at the admission potential (0.05 V-RHE) and an onset potential for the CO2 formation at E >= 0.20 V-RHE. The CO tolerance of Pt nanoparticles in PtAuSn/W2C is improved by the presence of oxide species on W2C through a bifunctional mechanism, as well as the electronic charge transfer from the W2C support to the metallic nanoparticles through an electronic effect.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700016

However, its applicability in the evaluation of multireactant systems is frequently not justified. Here, we derive figures of merit for multireactant enzyme mechanisms based on the stabilization of the transition states and the kinetic Haldane equilibrium relationships. For most bimolecular reactions, the ratio of k(cat)/KiAKB (where K-iA is the dissociation constant of A and K-B is the Michaelis constant of B) is best suited for comparing enzyme performance, especially at nonsaturating reactant concentrations. The value of this parameter for assessing the performance of a series of oxidoreductase mutants is demonstrated. Figures of merit for other common enzymatic mechanisms are derived, which enable a theory-based approach for comparing steady-state catalytic performances of enzymes with multiple reactants.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700017

Here, electronic, geometric, and interfacial phenomena associated with this peculiar effect are investigated. Generating mixed In-Zr oxides by coprecipitation does not improve performance, excluding a primary role of electronic parameters. Because even only 1 mol % of indium stabilizes the metastable tetragonal phase of zirconia, the relevance of its crystalline structure is explored in impregnated solids. Both tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 permit epitaxial growth of In2O3, but a more pronounced lattice mismatching leads to a lower dispersion of the oxide on the second, which is observed in the form of subnanometric islands on the carrier, and to more pronounced tensile forces. The latter triggers the formation of a surplus of oxygen vacancies only in this system, which is in line with its greatly enhanced indium-specific activity. Hence, a deposition synthesis method is essential to unlock the role of monoclinic zirconia. According to kinetic analyses, the monoclinic ZrO2-based catalyst can also better activate both reactants, likely because of a superior character of oxygen vacancies on supported In2O3 and a direct contribution of zirconia to CO2 activation on its own oxygen vacancies, which was investigated in comparison with In2O3 supported on alumina and ceria. Elucidating the nature of the active sites at the phase boundary and the impact of the defect chemistry of zirconia are identified as aspects to be prioritized in upcoming studies to shed further light on interfacial effects in this relevant catalytic system.									47	5	0	0	3	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700018

Nevertheless, its wide applications are always restricted by slow dynamics and limited durability. This paper reports a type of Mn-doped RuO2 nanocrystals for boosting the OER catalytic performance in acidic media. The catalyst (named Mn-RuO2) is prepared through annealing of Ru-exchanged Mn-based derivative at 300 degrees C. Such Mn-RuO2 exhibits excellent acidic OER activity, with an overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a stability of 5000 cycles in the presence of sulfuric acid (0.5 mol/L). Both structural characterization and theoretical analysis show that the Mn doping in RuO2 can tune the d-band center of Ru active sites and lower antibonding surface-adsorbate states, which leads to a decreased free energy of the rate-determining step, ultimately enhancing the intrinsic activity of RuO2.									57	2	0	0	2	0	58			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700020

They catalyze a variety of transformations, including enantioselective intermolecular cyclopropanations. This study is focused on understanding the kinetics of the rhodium-catalyzed cyclopropanation, and this information was used to develop conditions for conducting the reactions with very low catalyst loadings. The enantioselective cyclopropanation of styrenes can be conducted with a catalyst loading of 0.001 mol % and still maintain high levels of enantioselectivity (86-99% ee). A triarylcyclopropanecarboxylate (TPCP) catalyst, Rh-2(p-Ph-TPCP)(4), was the optimum catalyst for maintaining high enantioselectivity with very low catalyst loading.

Accordingly, a facile solvothermal method involving Cu and Pd composition migrations is developed in this study, to synthesize highly uniform and small-sized nanospheres (NSs) possessing the special structures of composition-graded (CG) Cu1Pd1 and surface-doped (SD) Ir-0.03 which are evenly anchored onto N-doped porous graphene (NPG) as a high-performance EOR electrocatalyst ((Cu1Pd1)-Cu-CG/Ir-SD(0.03) NSs/NPG). Comprehensive physicochemical characterizations, electrochemical analyses, and first-principles calculations reveal that, benefiting from the NPG-imparted mass-transfer and oxygen-reduction effects, the CG-SD structural and size morphology effects of the NS, as well as the Cu- and Ir-induced bifunctional, geometric, and ligand effects, (Cu1Pd1)-Cu-CG/Ir-SD(0.03) NSs/NPG exhibits not only ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity and highly efficient noble-metal (NM) utilization, showing 7105 and 6685 mA mg(-1) in Pd- and NM-mass-specific activity (MSA), respectively, which are 15.8 and 14.9 times those of commercial Pd/C, but also satisfactory electrocatalytic durability, retaining respective 28.1- and 19.2-fold enhancements in Pd-MSA compared to the commercial Pd/C, after 1 h chronoamperometric and 500-cycle potential cycling degradation tests. This study not only provides an effective and versatile synthetic strategy to prepare the NM-efficient metal-based nanomaterials with the special CG and SD structures for various electrocatalytic and energy-conversion applications, but also proposes some insights into the composition- and structure-function relations in EOR electrocatalytic mechanism for rationally designing highly active and durable EOR electrocatalysts.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700022

In this research, a simple and high-efficiency hard template method has been successfully developed by adopting carbon nanoparticles obtained from carbonation of polyethylene oxide and urea. The abundant -C-O-C- groups on the surface of carbon nanoparticles provide the high hydrophilicity (from -C-O-C- to -C-O-H) in the alkaline synthetic gel solution, which promotes the synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite and the aluminum condensation in the silica framework to improve the Bronsted acidity. The as-synthesized hierarchical zeolites exhibited two sets of channel systems: micropores (similar to 0.55 nm) are from the MFI framework network, and mesopores (similar to 12.5 and similar to 34.5 nm) result from carbon nanoparticles of 10-40 nm in size, respectively. The hierarchical ZSM-5 with minimized extraframework aluminum species showed catalytic performance with high ethanol conversion (100%) and high stability (lifetime above 30 h) in the ethanol to olefins conversion. Importantly, the diffusion efficiency in ZSM-5 with mesoporous size was remarkably improved, compared to the catalyst with mesoporous size similar to 12.5 nm. As the benzylation of mesitylene with benzyl alcohol, the ZSM-5 (similar to 34.5 nm) sample showed the highest conversion in benzyl alcohol (82.0%) and selectivity in 2-benzyl-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (74.3%).									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700023

Altered PHF8 activity is linked to genetic diseases and cancer; thus, it is an interesting target for epigenetic modulation. We describe the use of combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the mechanism of PHF8, including dioxygen activation, 2OG binding modes, and substrate demethylation steps. A PHF8 crystal structure manifests the 2OG C-1 carboxylate bound to iron in a nonproductive orientation, i.e., trans to His247. A ferryl-oxo intermediate formed by activating dioxygen bound to the vacant site in this complex would be nonproductive, i.e., "off-line" with respect to reaction with NE-methylated K9. We show rearrangement of the "off-line" ferryl-oxo intermediate to a productive "in-line" geometry via a solvent exchange reaction (called "ferryl-flip") is energetically unfavorable. The calculations imply that movement of the 20G C-1 carboxylate prior to dioxygen binding at a five-coordination stage in catalysis proceeds with a low barrier, suggesting that two possible 2OG C-1 carboxylate geometries can coexist at room temperature. We explored alternative mechanisms for hydrogen atom transfer and show that second sphere interactions orient the NE-methylated lysine in a conformation where hydrogen abstraction from a methyl C-H bond is energetically more favorable than hydrogen abstraction from the N-H bond of the protonated NE-methyl group. Using multiple HAT reaction path calculations, we demonstrate the crucial role of conformational flexibility in effective hydrogen transfer. Subsequent hydroxylation occurs through a rebound mechanism, which is energetically preferred compared to desaturation, due to second sphere interactions. The overall mechanistic insights reveal the crucial role of iron-center rearrangement, second sphere interactions, and conformational flexibility in PHF8 catalysis and provide knowledge useful for the design of mechanism-based PHF8 inhibitors.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700024	31976154

Apart from classical rational design and directed evolution approaches, machine learning methods have been increasingly applied to find patterns in data that help predict protein structures, improve enzyme stability, solubility, and function, predict substrate specificity, and guide rational protein design. In this Perspective, we analyze the state of the art in databases and methods used for training and validating predictors in enzyme engineering. We discuss current limitations and challenges which the community is facing and recent advancements in experimental and theoretical methods that have the potential to address those challenges. We also present our view on possible future directions for developing the applications to the design of efficient biocatalysts.									41	4	0	0	22	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700025

The catalytic behavior of these materials is governed by the size and shape of the surface "ensembles" of PGM atoms. Therefore, establishing a means of control over the topological architecture of highly dilute alloy surfaces is crucial to optimizing their catalytic performance. In the present work, we use on-lattice Monte Carlo simulations that are parameterized by density functional theory-derived energetics to investigate the surface aggregation of PGM atoms under vacuum conditions and in the presence of CO. We study several highly dilute alloy surfaces at various PGM loadings, including Pd/Au(1 1 1), Pd/Ag(1 1 1), Pt/Cu(1 1 1), Rh/Cu(1 1 1), Ir/Ag(1 1 1), and Ni/Cu(1 1 1). Under vacuum conditions, we observe a thermodynamic preference for dispersion of PGM as single atoms in the surface of the coinage metal host, on all examined alloy surfaces except Ir/Ag(1 1 1), where Ir atom aggregation and island formation is preferred. By evaluating the alloy surface structure in the presence of CO, we determine that the size and shape of PGM ensembles can be manipulated by tuning the partial pressure of CO (P-CO) on the Pd/Au(1 1 1), Pd/Ag(1 1 1), Ir/Ag(1 1 1), and Ni/Cu(1 1 1) surfaces. In contrast, we determine that Pt/Cu(1 1 1) and Rh/Cu(1 1 1) highly dilute alloys are unresponsive to changes in P-CO with Rh and Pt dispersing as isolated single atoms within the host matrix, irrespective of gaseous composition. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to fine-tune the surface architecture of highly dilute binary alloys for optimized catalytic performance.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700026

For instance, transition metal oxide-based catalysts film has an optimum coating thickness due to the charge transport limitation. In this article, we investigated the charge transport behavior at the interface between the catalysts and the underlying substrate, which has been less investigated than the two other charge-transporting interfaces, that is, the catalysts surfaces and the inner catalysts film. We observed that Mn3O4 nanocatalysts exhibited different oxygen-evolving performances depending on the underlying substrate, and this activity trend was correlated with the work function of the substrate. We analyzed the work function dependency based on the energy band structure at the catalysts substrate interface and determined that the substrates with low work functions formed high Schottky barriers, disturbing the interfacial charge transport. On the basis of this understanding, we demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Mn3O4 nanocatalysts film can be significantly enhanced using industrially important Ti substrates that have a thin buffering interlayer with the proper work function.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700027

After the pioneering studies of Fryzuk, who described the noninnocent behavior of the amine-based aliphatic pincer ligands, and of Milstein, who discovered the dearomative cooperation mechanism in pyridine-based pincer systems, this concept also became prevalent in the context of pincer complexes. Many excellent reviews have dealt with these aspects of heteroatom-based pincer compounds. Nevertheless, this perspective aims to focus on recent developments in the chemistry and catalytic applications of the carbometalated pincer ligands for which noninnocent behavior is rarely observed, and especially those applications incorporating an appended functionality that can interact with the catalytic center. Combining the concepts of robust carbometalated pincer complexes and cooperative mechanisms highlighted by modulation of the secondary coordination sphere provides a "second wind" for this powerful family of organometallic compounds.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700028

In this study, density functional theory calculations were used to reveal the mechanisms of silver- and scandium-catalyzed alkylation of diazo compounds to construct compounds with tertiary or quaternary carbon centers. The results show that, with a silver(I) salt as the catalyst, the reaction starts with carbenation of silver(I) to afford a Fisher-type silver carbene. Nucleophilic addition of silver carbene complex yields an enolate intermediate, which is followed by annulation/retro-aldol reaction to give a dialkylation product. Meanwhile, scandium(III) salt behaves as Lewis acid to generate free carbene, which is followed by conjugate addition of free carbene to produce an enolate intermediate. Subsequent 1,4-proton transfer to a synthesized monoalkylation product is more favorable than nucleophilic addition process. Computational studies show that formation of mono- or dialkylation products from enolate intermediates results from competition between the nucleophilicity and Bronsted basicity of the alpha-carbon in the enolate intermediate, which is mainly controlled by the transition-metal catalyst. The global nucleophilicity and Laplacian of the electron density were evaluated to reveal factors affecting the nucleophilicity and Bronsted basicity.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700029

Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) are two important platform compounds for asymmetric C-C bond formation. In this study, several artificial ATP-free in vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystems were constructed to produce valuable chemicals via facile synthesis of GA3P and DHAP from starch and pyrophosphate. Six cascade enzymes were used for the biotransformation of starch and pyrophosphate to GA3P or DHAP: alpha-glucan phosphorylase (alpha GP), phosphoglucomutase (PGM), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), pyrophosphate phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK), D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FruA), and triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). These two compounds were then used to produce various chemicals, including 2-deoxy-D-ribose (DR) and rare ketoses. After the optimization of reaction conditions, similar to 23.2 mM DR with a product yield of 96.7% and 15.2 mM D-allulose with a product yield of 95.0% were produced, both achieving near-stoichiometric yields through downstream aldol additions and dephosphorylation reactions in one pot. In addition, more than 80% of the product yields of DR and many rare ketoses, such as D-allulose, L-tagatose, D-sorbose, L-fructose, and D-xylulose, from high concentrations of substrates were obtained, showing high industrial potential. This in vitro biomanufacturing platform may provide a promising and cost-effective approach for biomanufacturing value-added chemicals through asymmetric C-C bond formation in the near future.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700030

The integration of this process with methane partial oxidation in a single cell can eliminate or even reverse the electrical power demands of co-electrolysis, while simultaneously producing syngas at industrially attractive H-2/CO ratios. Nevertheless, this system is rather complex and requires catalytically active and coke tolerant electrodes. Here, we report on a low-substitution rhodium-titanate perovskite (La0.43Ca0.32Rh0.06Ti094O3) electrode for the process, capable of exsolving high Rh nanoparticle populations, and assembled in a symmetrical solid oxide cell configuration. By introducing dry methane to the anode compartment, the electricity demands are impressively decreased, even allowing syngas and electricity cogeneration. To provide further insight on the Rh nanoparticles role on methane-to-syngas conversion, we adjusted their size and population by altering the reduction temperature of the perovskite. Our results exemplify how the exsolution concept can be employed to efficiently exploit noble metals for activating low-reactivity greenhouse gases in challenging energy-related applications.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700032

Some of the natural phenomena in which water plays the role of solvent, reactant, or byproduct find parallels in industrially relevant reactions catalyzed by synthetic heterogeneous catalysts. This review addresses different mechanistic features of catalytic reactions influenced by water. They include modification of reactant (or product) solubility and rate of mass transport; stabilization of reactants, products, and transition states, both in open and confined spaces; and direct participation in the catalytic phenomenon by remote bond polarization, H-shuttling, or acting as a cocatalyst.									45	0	0	0	3	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700034

A potential method to avoid this problem is to deposit single-atom catalysts on the nodes so that the products bind in a more favorable monodentate mode. Such catalytic active sites can be characterized with atomic precision, enabling detailed computational mechanistic studies. Thus, we used density functional theory to perform a comprehensive screening of single-atom transition-metal catalysts, in varying oxidation states, deposited on NU-1000 nodes for the gas-phase hydrolysis of the nerve agent sarin. By calculating the complete reaction pathways for M-NU-1000 systems, we discovered that the highest reaction barrier varies between catalysts, highlighting the need to consider more than a single reaction step when screening a large number of diverse materials. The single-metal catalysts are predicted to exhibit lower product desorption energies than unfunctionalized NU-1000. By comparing their relative turnover frequencies using the energetic span model, we identified several catalysts that are predicted to be more active than the parent MOF for this reaction. Finally, we explored periodic trends and molecular descriptors for their effect on catalytic activity.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700035

We, herein, report one facile calcination approach with ammonium chloride and melamine as the template to synthesize nitrogen modified Nb2O5 nanomeshes material (Nb2O5-N), which exhibits a 37-fold reaction rate larger than its commercial counterpart in photocatalytic oxidation of toluene into benzaldehyde under visible light irradiation. The reactivity is ascribed to an extended absorption spectrum within 700 nm by nitrogen modification.

The hydroxyl group was displaced by O-, S-, and N-centered nucleophiles to provide enantioenriched five-membered tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, and tetrahydrothiophene as well as six-membered tetrahydroquinolines and chromanes in up to a 99% yield and 100% enantiospecificity with water as the only byproduct. Mechanistic studies using both experiments and calculations have been performed for substrates generating 5-membered heterocycles. Rate studies show dependences in a catalyst, an internal nucleophile, and an electrophile, however, independence in an external nucleophile, an electrophile, or water. Kinetic isotope effect studies show an inverse KIE of k(H)/k(D) = 0.79. Furthermore, phosphinic acid does not promote S(N)1 reactivity. Computational studies support a bifunctional role of the phosphinic acid in which activation of both nucleofuge and nucleophile occurs in a bridging S(N)2-type transition state. In this transition state, the acidic hydrogen of phosphinic acid protonates the leaving hydroxyl group simultaneously as the oxo group partially deprotonates the nucleophile. Thereby, phosphinic acid promotes the substitution of the nonderivatized hydroxyl group in enantioenriched secondary alcohols by uncharged nucleophiles with conservation of the chirality from the alcohol to the heterocycle.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700038

Herein, we fabricated different Cu-based catalysts with multiple interfaces by facile reduction of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), aimed at controlling the reaction pathway and product selectivity in the hydrogenation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), an important biomass-based platform molecule. These Cu catalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman, TPR, HAADF-STEM, and in situ XAFS. For Cu/MgAlOx, derived from CuMg5Al2-LDHs, Cu particles were partially encapsulated by a MgAlOx support, thus forming highly intimate Cu-MgAlOx interfaces. On Co@Cu/CoAlOx, derived from CuCoxAl2-LDHs, together with a Cu-CoAlOx interface, partially reduced ultrasmall Co clusters were mounted around Cu particles to form a metallic Co-Cu interface, which is tunable by varying the Cu/Co ratio. As expected, Cu/MgAlO, was only active in C=O hydrogenation to produce 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF) in a 92.7% yield, while Co@Cu/3CoAlO(x) sequentially catalyzed the C=O hydrogenation and C-OH hydrogenolysis to yield as high as 98.5% 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), in sharp contrast to Co@Cu/5CoAlO(x), which further broke the C=C bonds of DMF to yield 83.6% 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF). The dependence of the reaction pathway and product selectivity on the composition and properties of the interface was revealed by identifying various intermediates using in situ IR. Specifically, HMF transformed into an O-bound intermediate on the Cu sites over the Cu-MgAlOx, while the unsaturated interfacial Cu-CoAlOx structure served as dual active sites to form a C,O-bound intermediate, thus leading to different products. In addition, the tunable Cu-Co interfacial sites remarkably influenced the adsorption modes of C=C bonds in the furan ring. This work provides a rationale for controlling the reaction pathway and product selectivity for complicated biomass reactions via the controllable construction of multiple interfaces.									28	2	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700039

This report discloses an ethanol synthesis strategy from syngas (CO + H-2) and syngas-derived dimethyl ether (DME) by a tailor-made catalyst with a macroscopic capsule structure. The macroscopically designed capsule catalyst consisted of a millimeter-sized Cu/ZnO core and a micrometer-sized H-Mordenite zeolite shell. The catalyst preparation process further successfully fabricated a zeolite shell, migrated a few Cu from the core, as the promoter of the shell, to significantly improve the catalyst performance. As the methanol byproduct can be easily recycled to DME as a reactant via a simple dehydration reaction, ethanol selectivity can reach 100% theoretically. It is demonstrated that a space-confined-self-regulation mechanism derived from a macroscopic capsule structure serves as a multifunctional switch to manipulate tandem reactions: arranging reaction steps in a favorable order and depressing side reactions simultaneously. These findings will inspire designing a heterogeneous catalyst with multiple functions, shortening the organic or catalytic synthesis route, and also open an avenue to ethanol synthesis from syngas, as DME is also simply produced from syngas.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700040

The accessible mesoporous structures of both the core and shell significantly facilitate mass transfer and catalyst utilization, improving the synergistic catalytic abilities in cascade reactions. The obtained bifunctional nanocatalysts enabled efficient two-step one-pot cascade reactions of different types: dynamic kinetic resolution of primary amines in organic solvent with high yield and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield and 98% ee) and degradation of organophosphate nerve agent in aqueous solution with high rate constant and turnover frequency number values (0.8 min(-1) and 20 min(-1) respectively).									10	1	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700041

Here, the effect of the support on methane combustion was elucidated using Pd nanoparticles supported on various metal oxides (theta-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, MgO, La2O3, TiO2, SnO2, and Nb2O5). To eliminate the effect of Pd particle size and morphology, uniform Pd particles were synthesized in the liquid phase. Interestingly, the methane combustion activity formed a volcano plot when plotted against the oxide formation enthalpy (Delta H-f(M-O)degrees) of the support. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy, the structure of the Pd nanoparticles on the support in an oxidizing atmosphere was identified. Pd particles on theta-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3, ZrO2 and CeO2 with moderate Delta H-f(M-O)degrees adopted a metal-core oxide-shell structure and showed the highest activities for methane combustion. In contrast, completely oxidized Pd particles were present on MgO and La2O3, which have lower Delta H-f(M-O)degrees and were not very active. Pd metal particles on TiO2, SnO2, and Nb2O5 with higher Delta H-f(M-O)degrees were not effective catalysts for methane combustion.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700042

In this study, a record fructose yield of greater than 50% with selectivity exceeding 80% was obtained from glucose concentration of 10 wt % by adopting a 1-butanol/hydrotalcite catalytic system. In this novel process, Mg2+ leaching from hydrotalcite, which is an important issue when utilizing hydrotalcite for glucose isomerization in aqueous solution, was negligible during the reaction. NMR study confirmed that the absence of deuterium at the C-1 position of the fructose product as well as C-2 position of glucose-2-D clearly supports the base-catalyzed deprotonation of the C-2 position in glucose. Also, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the selective formation of fructose from glucose over hydrotalcite surface in 1-butanol than other solvents. Notably, after glucose isomerization, the highly pure glucose (91%) and fructose crystals (95%) were recovered easily from 1-butanol solvent by subsequent cooling and filtration without requiring chromatographic separation. Therefore, the hydrotalcite/1-butanol catalytic system is simple, inexpensive, and a green process for the high-yield fructose production from glucose when compared with current industrial procedures that rely on enzymatic isomerization reactions and chromatographic separations.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700043

Using inexpensive and nontoxic 4-cyanopyridine N-oxide as the cyano shuttle, the methods provide an efficient approach to prepare aryl cyanides and vinyl nitriles under mild and operationally simple reaction conditions with a broad range of functional group tolerances. In hydrocyanation of alkynes, the method demonstrated good regioselectivity, producing predominantly E- or Z-alkenyl nitriles in a controlled manner and exclusively Markovnikov vinyl nitriles when internal diaryl alkynes and terminal alkynes were applied as the substrates, respectively. The preliminary mechanistic investigation indicated that the C-CN bond cleavage process is promoted by oxidative addition to the nickel(I) complex in the cyanation of aryl halides, and further studies via a series of deuterium exchange experiments indicated that water serves as the hydrogen source for the hydrocyanation of alkynes.									28	1	0	0	9	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700044

The utilization of active oxygen species for the direct conversion of methane to value-added products at moderate temperatures was investigated. The active oxygen sites for the selective conversion of methane were identified by a TPR feature at 220 degrees C. This site is also characterized by an infrared band observed at 1872 and 1892 cm(-1) upon adsorption of NO. These bands are NO stretching vibrations of NO adsorbed on iron oxygen monomeric species, present in the zeolite cages and responsible for selective oxidation. We show that these oxidized species react with methane to form oxygenates but at higher temperatures form molecular oxygen. IR bands of surface methoxy groups were observed in significant concentration in the FTIR spectra and are suggested to be intermediate species of the selective oxidation of methane. Studies using continuous reactors demonstrated that cofeeding of methane and N2O-promoted generation of desired products from methane conversion by N2O over Fe-FER catalyst can be enhanced by optimizing the feed ratio of CH4/N2O. Furthermore, N-2, O-2 and NO were detected as the products of N2O decomposition over Fe-FER catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700045

It is demonstrated that the xenon chemical shift, observed in the porous space of Pt-containing alumina pellets, can be used to monitor the temperature changes under rapidly progressing, nonsteady-state conditions during start-up of the catalytic reaction.

The results demonstrated surface-directed selection of the enzyme environment, where amines with lower enzyme-directed incorporation ratio possess higher activation effects, leading to a strategy of self-optimization of the enzyme microenvironment for better catalytic performances.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700047

An alternative to this process, utilizing carbon dioxide and thus potentially mitigating its environmentally harmful emissions, is dry methane reforming (DMR: CH4 + CO2 -> 2CO + 2H(2)). Both of these reactions are structure sensitive, that is, not all atoms in a catalytic metal nanoparticle have the same activity. Mapping this structure sensitivity and understanding its mechanistic workings provides ways to design better, more efficient, and more stable catalysts. Here, we study a range of SiO2-supported Ni nanoparticles with varying particle sizes (1.2-6.0 nm) by operando infrared spectroscopy to determine the active mechanism over Ni (carbide mechanism) and its kinetic dependence on Ni particle size. We establish that Ni particle sizes below 2.5 nm lead to a different structure sensitivity than is expected from and implied in literature. Because of the identification of CHxDx species with isotopically labeled experiments, we show that CH4 activation is not the only rate-limiting step in SMR and DMR. The recombination of C and O or the activation of CO is likely also an important kinetically limiting factor in the production of synthesis gas in DMR, whereas for SMR the desorption of the formed CO becomes more kinetically limiting. Furthermore, we establish the Ni particle size dependence of carbon whisker formation. The optimal Ni particle size both in terms of activity for SMR and DMR, at 500 and 600 degrees C, and 5 bar, was found to be approximately 2-3 nm, whereas carbon whisker formation was found to maximally occur at approximately 4.5 nm for SMR and for DMR increased with increasing particle size. These results have direct practical applications for tuning of activity and selectivity of these reactions, while providing fundamental understanding of their working.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700048

Single-unit-cell Bi2WO6 monolayers, forming a sandwich-like structure, [BiO](+)-[WO4](2-)-[BiO](+), exhibit promising photocatalytic performance and are an ideal system for isolating subsurface defects. We report the single-step synthesis of Bi2WO6 monolayers rich in stable interior W vacancies and characterize their influence on the physical properties necessary for effective photocatalytic surface reactions. Defect-rich monolayers benefit from enhanced visible-light absorption and photocarrier transport, boosting the solar photocatalytic oxidation of benzylic alcohols by 140% at no cost to selectivity or stability. This work highlights the importance of subsurface defects within surface-driven photocatalytic applications and prescribes a general strategy for their isolated study via 2D compounds exhibiting symmetric surface termination.									44	2	0	0	7	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700049

However, it is challenging to achieve high reaction rates while maintaining good selectivity. Here, we used an H-2 bubble-templated electrodeposition method in a thiocyanate (SCN)-containing aqueous electrolyte to synthesize a hierarchically porous Ag nanofoam (AgNF) with curved Ag surfaces modified by SCN. This AgNF demonstrates excellent performance for CO2 reduction with a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97%. It can maintain over 90% FECO in a wide potential window (-0.5 to -1.2 V-RHE), enabling the maximum CO selective current density of 33 mA cm(-2) and the mass activity of 23.5 A g(Ag)(-1), which are the highest values among recently reported Ag-based electrocatalysts. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytic performance of the AgNF correlates with the density of surface SCN ligands, which exhibit excellent electrochemical stability under negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations suggest that SCN ligands promote the formation of COOH* intermediates by modifying the local electron density at the active sites. Further, the synthesis method is applicable to different catalyst substrates. For example, the AgNF grown on a carbon-based gas diffusion film exhibits an ultrahigh mass activity of 52.1 A g(Ag)(-1) and maintains its high CO selectivity simultaneously, demonstrating excellent potentials for practical applications.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700050

In this work, we systematically varied the composition of the metal nodes (Fe2M) of the MOF PCN-250 and used density functional theory (DFT) to identify promising catalysts for light alkane C-H bond activation. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes was studied using N2O as the oxidant to understand the reactivity of the oxocentered Fe2M nodes found in PCN-250, where the Fe ions are in the +3 oxidation state and M is a metal with the oxidation state of +2. We show that the N2O activation barrier is positively correlated with the oxygen-binding energy at the metal center, and the C-H activation barrier is negatively correlated with this same quantity. For clusters containing early transition metals, oxygen binds strongly, facilitating N2O activation but hindering C-H activation. To validate the DFT predictions, we synthesized and tested PCN-250(Fe2M) with M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni and found that PCN-250(Fe2Mn) and PCN-250(Fe-3) are more active than PCN-250(Fe2Co) and PCN-250(Fe2Ni) in agreement with the DFT predictions, demonstrating the power of DFT calculations to predict and identify promising MOF catalysts for alkane C-H bond activation in advance of experiments.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700052

Both the Nicotiana tabacum 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) and Aspergillus terreus aristolochene synthase (ATAS) belong to FPPC, involve the same reaction pathway, and yield their ultimate main product (aristolochene) with different stereochemistries. The catalytic promiscuity of TEAS and fidelity of ATAS have been observed in previous experimental studies, but the detailed catalytic mechanism is still not clear. Herein, by employing the quantum classical multiscale molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, the complete enzyme catalytic pathways from the substrate to aristolochene and various side products (in TEAS) are investigated and the important mechanism insights are included: (1) the PPi moiety (diphosphate group, released from the substrate) would further act as the general acid/base in both TEAS and ATAS enzyme catalysis, which likely plays a general role in FPPC. (2) The Asp444-TyrS20 dyad acts as an additional general acid/base residue pair to increase promiscuity in TEAS. (3) The enriched aromatic residues are essential for the catalytic fidelity of ATAS. Finally, we further discuss the three critical chemical control factors which are proposed to be responsible for the catalytic promiscuity and fidelity in most FPPC, that is, substrate folding mode, intermediate flexibility, and key residue, owing to the more or less plasticity of the active pocket in various FPPC.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700053

However, high process temperatures and the possibility of coke formation require catalyst modifications to mitigate such effects. One of the emerging approaches to prevent platinum catalyst deactivation is the use of boron additives that have been proposed to prevent coking. Despite such a valuable property of boron, the mechanisms for extending the catalyst lifetime and the decrease in coke formation based on this method are still poorly understood. The type and transformations of boron species on silica surface were investigated as a function of boron introduction, platinum addition, catalyst activation, and catalytic reactivity by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations to uncover the possible role of boron modification in improving the catalytic performance. Catalytic nonoxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane revealed that incorporation of boron improved the catalytic activity (similar to 3x) and stability of Pt/SiO2. The role of boron in enhancing catalytic performance was attributed to facilitating the migration of alkyl groups from platinum catalytic centers to tetrahedrally coordinated boron sites.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700055

A suitable conductive scaffold can play a positive role in enhancing the relevant hydrogen evolution performance. Here we demonstrate that three-dimensional NiCoSe2 nanosheet arrays supported on Ni foam are effective as the conductive scaffold for enhancing the catalytic activity of layered MoS1.5Se0.5 particles. The resulting hierarchical MoS1.5Se0.5/NiCoSe2, hybrid electrocatalyst is highly efficient for hydrogen evolution in acid, yielding geometric current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials as low as 57, 88, and 102 mV with good long-term durability at current densities up to 500 mA cm(-2) over 25 h. To the best of our knowledge, no MoS2-based electrocatalyst can realize both low overpotential affording a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) and good durability at a large current density (500 mA cm(-2)) except this report. In particular, the double-layer capacitance, turnover frequency measurements, and high normalized exchange current density indicate its possibly high intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution in acid. It is among the most efficient earth-abundant catalysts exhibiting a low overpotential and simultaneous good intrinsic activity reported on a three-dimensional architecture thus far.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700056

Here, we present a detailed density functional theory (DFT) mechanistic study on this remarkable reaction. Induced by the Lewis base morpholine (or MOR, the amine substrate), Co-2(CO)(8) disproportionates to [Co(CO)(3)(MOR)(2)](+) and [Co(CO)(4)](-). The active catalyst [Co(CO)(4)](-) undergoes an S(N)2 reaction with the alkyl tosylate substrate to form an alkylcobalt(I) carbonyl intermediate with an inverted configuration at the alpha-carbon. The alkylcobalt(I) carbonyl complex favors CO migratory insertion over beta-hydride elimination. The resulting acylcobalt(I) carbonyl intermediate, along with the MOR and CO substrates, could introduce several pathways for the amide C-N bond formation. The inner-sphere pathways involving Co(I)-bound MOR are ruled out. The outer-sphere pathway in which MOR attacks the Co(I)-bound acyl leads to the amide product and the regenerated [Co(CO)(4)](-). The S(N)2 process is the rate-determining step with the largest energy span (Delta G* = 22.8 kcal/mol). The side reaction of double CO insertion faces a higher selectivity-determining energy barrier and hence is less favorable. This DFT work provides deep mechanistic insights into the Co-2(CO)(8)-promoted chemoselective aminocarbonylation of unactivated alkyl electrophiles, thereby having implications for organocobalt catalysis and transition-metal-catalyzed amide C-N bond-forming reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700057

Ni/Al2O3 displayed a high activity for the complete conversion of CO and CO2 to methane and C2+ hydrocarbons. Moreover, over a discrete and relatively narrow temperature range, the net concentration of light C2+ hydrocarbons was elevated, with the exit stream containing a higher concentration of C2+ species than was present in the feed stream and the product stream being virtually free of carbon oxides. It is found that the addition of manganese can enhance the selectivity toward the production of light hydrocarbons. A series of Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared with different Ni/Mn ratios, were studied. Various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, CO and H-2 chemisorption, in situ nitric oxide adsorption Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (NO-FTIR), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were performed to gain an insight into how the addition of Mn to the primary catalyst enhances the yield of light hydrocarbons. The origin of Mn promotion was demonstrated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed the favorable Mn substitution at the Ni(211) step edge sites under reducing conditions. The affinity of these Mn species toward oxidation stabilizes the CO dissociation product and thus provides a thermodynamic driving force that promotes C-O bond cleavage compared to the Mn-unmodified catalyst surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700059		
J	Zhu, Ran; Chatzidimitriou, Anargyros; Liu, Bowei; Kerwood, Deborah J.; Bond, Jesse Q.				Zhu, Ran/AAO-6811-2020				Understanding the Origin of Maleic Anhydride Selectivity during the Oxidative Scission of Levulinic Acid								ACS CATALYSIS				10	2			1555	1565		10.1021/acscatal.9b04289				JAN 17 2020	2020	Biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) is a green platform chemical, and we have previously reported an oxidative scission pathway that selectively transforms it into maleic anhydride (MA). This reaction is curious because it requires oxidative scission of the terminal (methyl) carbon in levulinic acid, whereas gas-phase methyl ketone oxidations are typically selective toward internal (alkyl) bond scission. In order to probe the origin of this disparity, we consider trends observed during the oxidative scission of ketones, keto acids, and keto acid analogues, and we highlight influences of steric hindrances, a-carbon substitution, and the presence of a secondary carboxylic acid functionality. We further consider the role of cyclic intermediates, namely Angelica lactones, in mediating selectivity during the oxidative scission of levulinic acid. Our kinetic analysis is supported by FTIR spectroscopy, which reveals the formation of hydrogen-deficient surface intermediates prior to the onset of oxidative scission. Finally, we pair short-contact-time selectivity analysis with GCMS and NMR spectroscopy to identify a previously undisclosed reaction intermediate-protoanemonin-that forms during the oxidative scission of levulinic acid and a-Angelica lactone. We conclude that facile oxidative dehydrogenation of beta-Angelica lactone to form protoanemonin is the major driving force for the high selectivity toward methyl scission during levulinic acid oxidation. We also note that protoanemonin is an intriguing polyfunctional molecule that appears well-suited to bio-based production, and we have observed that it can be synthesized in yields from 55% to 75% (albeit at low concentration presently) during periods of transient reactor operation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700061

In the present study, the mechanisms and kinetics of methanol oxidation by the aqueous bioinorganic vanadium haloperoxidase (VHPO) enzyme mimic and the heterogeneous solid oxide supported VO4/SiO2 catalyst operating in the gas-solid reaction are compared in order to address the origin of the different reactivities. The molecular level chemical transformations during methanol oxidation by the aqueous VHPO enzyme mimic, possessing the oxo-peroxo O=VO2(-O-C) functionalities, and heterogeneous supported VO4/SiO2 catalysts, containing isolated vanadyl O=V(-O-Si)(3) sites, were monitored with time-resolved in situ vibrational spectroscopy (Raman and IR). Both catalytic reactions proceed via the same methoxy (V-OCH3) reaction intermediate formed upon methanol chemisorption at the bridging V-O-C/V-O-Si bonds. The difference in reactivity is related to the much lower activation energy for breaking the C-H bond of the V-OCH3 intermediate, the rate-determining step, by the highly reactive vanadium peroxo VO2 sites only present for bioinorganic enzyme mimics and absent from heterogeneous catalysts under reaction conditions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700062

Two neighboring Zr-cus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene. They are formed upon reductive catalyst treatment, and their concentration depends on the strength of interaction among CrOx, ZrO2, and support and on the size of ZrO2 crystallites in CrZrOx. SiO2 weakly interacting with CrOx was found to be a more preferable support than Al2O3- or TiO2-based supports. CrOx species promotes formation of Zr-cus sites and improves their intrinsic activity for the desired reaction. CrOx also contributes to coke formation as concluded from operando UV-vis analysis. Cr20Zr80/SiO2 possessing about 3.9 or 2.5 times lower amounts of chromium or zirconium in comparison with an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 or state-of-the-art Ru/LaZrOx revealed about 2 times higher space-time yield of propene at 30% propane conversion at 550 degrees C. Moreover, this catalyst was durable over 50 dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles lasting 150 h.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700063

To this aim, the reaction with olefin of three-member zirconaziridium metallacycles [Cp2Zr-(eta(2)-CH2-N(R)(2))](+)[X](-) [R = C18H37; X- = MeB(C6F5)(3)(-) (1BN) or B(C6F5)(4)(-) (1BT)], models for tight (t-ISIP, 1BN) and loose (l-ISIP, 1BT) inner sphere ion pair (ISIPs), was studied at different levels of concentration and thus self-aggregation. Both 1BN and 1BT undergo a regioselective insertion of a single a-olefin molecule (1-hexene or 2-Me-1-heptene) into the Zr-C bond to form the corresponding five-member metallacycles outer sphere ion pairs (2BN, 2BT, 3BN, and 3BT), with no evidence for further olefin insertions. Under comparable experimental conditions, where monomeric ion pairs dominate (aggregation number N approximate to 1), the apparent rate constant (k(app)) of 1-hexene insertion into 1BT is about 200 times higher than that in 1BN, in agreement with the weaker strength of cation-anion interaction in the former. For 1BT, k(app) is only marginally affected by the self-aggregation level in all investigated experimental conditions. For example, k(app) = 1.1 M-1 s(-1) (N approximate to 1.1) and 1.3 (N approximate to 4.8) for the insertion reaction of 1-hexene in toluene at 223 K and range from 19 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1) (N approximate to 1.5) to 10 x 10(-3) (N approximate to 39) for the insertion of 2-Me-1-heptene in methylcyclohexane at 258 K. On the contrary, k(app) is markedly dependent on self-aggregation in the case of 1BN. For instance, when 1BN is reacted with 1-hexene in methylcyclohexane at 258 K, k(app) increases more than 1 order of magnitude, from 6 x 10(-3) to 93 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1), upon increasing the aggregation level from N approximate to 1 ([1BN] = 6 x 10(-3) M) to N approximate to 4.6 ([1BN] = 12.8 x 10(-3) M). Although the insertion of 1-hexene in 1BN is faster in the slightly more polar solvent toluene (k(app) = 39 x 10(-5) M, N approximate to 1), the relative reactivity difference between ion pairs and larger ionic aggregates is similar in both solvents (about 4X and 3X increment, on passing from N 1.0 to N 1.6, in methylcyclohexane and toluene, respectively). The addition of an inert external salt with a common counterion (2BN) to solution of 1BN dramatically raises the olefin insertion rate constant: at [1BN] = 6 x 10(-5) M, k(app) increases from 6 x 10(-3) M-(1) s(-1), in the absence of 2BN, to 42 x 10(-3), 90 x 10(-3), and 166 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1) in the presence of 1, 3, and 5 equiv of 2BN, respectively. All of the thermodynamic and kinetic data can be rationalized by taking into account the strength of cation-anion interaction in the two kinds of ion pairs. In t-ISIPs, the cation-anion interaction energy is relatively strong, resulting in a relatively small dipole moment and a little thermodynamic tendency to self-aggregate. However, under conditions where homo (or mixed) ion aggregates form, an additional weakening of the cation-anion interaction occurs, causing a substantial increase of the intrinsic reactivity of each t-ISIP within aggregates.On the other side, the cation-anion interaction is already relatively weak in t-ISIPs and ionic aggregates forms much more easily from the thermodynamic point of view; in this case, however, the extra weakening of cation-anion interaction only marginally alters the overall barrier for olefin insertion in each t-ISIP.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700064

Chemo-enzymatic approaches have previously been shown to enable a step economic access to both enantiomers of this alkaloid, but the scalability of these syntheses is limited. Herein, we report a chemo-enzymatic route to dihydropinidine that is dominated by biocatalytic steps and affords the target alkaloid in excellent stereoisomeric purity (>99% ee and de) and high yield (57% overall) on multigram scale. Our synthesis makes use of a solvent-free, Lewis acid-catalyzed Michael addition and a biocatalytic alternative to Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation, achieved by pig liver esterase (PLE)-catalyzed ester hydrolysis and acidification, and specifically developed for this purpose, to access a key intermediate, nonane-2,6-dione. This diketone is then converted into dihydropinidine by a concurrent one-pot (cascade) biotransformation catalyzed by a transaminase, an imine reductase, and an alcohol dehydrogenase. High yields and excellent regio- and stereoselectivities of the individual transformations render chromatographic purification of intermediates unnecessary and make it possible to carry out the entire sequence with a final hydrochloride precipitation of the target alkaloid as the sole purification step.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700065

The accumulation of Li2CO3 leads to battery degradation and results in a short lifespan. Herein, a carbon nanotube supported Ru/NiO@Ni catalyst (Ru/NiO@Ni/CNT) is synthesized with Ru nanoparticles (similar to 2.5 nm) anchored on the surface of core-shell structure NiO@Ni nanoparticles (similar to 17 nm). We found strong interfacial interactions between Ru nanoparticles and NiO. XRD and XPS analysis revealed that the presence of Ru could protect the Ni species from being deeply oxidized while the NiO species could modify the local electronic structure of Ru, inducing a higher oxidation state. When such a Ru/NiO@Ni/CNT catalyst is used as a cathode in Li-(CO2/O-2 (v:v = 4:1) batteries, a long cycling life of 105 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) with an overpotential as low as 1.01 V was achieved, which is significantly better than 75 and 44 cycles with Ru/CNT and NiO@Ni/CNT catalysts, respectively, and confirms the strong synergetic effect between the Ru and NiO species in the electrocatalytic decomposition of Li2CO3. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electrochemical decomposition of Li2CO3 with the assistance of RuO2 indicates that the formation of O-2 is the rate-determining step. In addition, the formation and decomposition process of Li2CO3 was illuminated at a molecular level by in situ FTIR spectroscopy with Ru/NiO@Ni/CNT catalysts.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700068

The size of the gem-dialkyl substituents affects the C-C-C bond angles within the ligands and consequently the P-M-P ligand bite angles. A combination of solid-state X-ray diffraction (XRD) and density functional theory (DFT) studies has shown that an increase in substituent size results in a distortion of the 6-membered metal-ligand chair conformation toward a boat conformation, to avoid bond angle strain. The influence of the gem-dialkyl effect on the catalytic performance of the complexes in palladium-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-octene has been investigated.

Here, we introduce a strategy for arylsilylation of electron deficient terminal alkenes by combining photoredox-catalyzed silyl radical generation, innate reactivity of silyl radical with alkene, and Ni-catalyzed aryl-alkyl cross-coupling. This cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis operates under mild conditions. It employs readily available alkenes, aryl bromides, and silane as reagents, and it produces useful synthetic building blocks in a modular manner.									20	1	0	0	7	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100084

Moreover, many of the cycloalkane units bear multiple substituents and stereocenters. Therefore, synthetic methods that produce polysubstituted aminocyclobutanes and aminocyclopropanes in a highly diastereo- and enantioselective manner are of importance. Herein, we describe the diastereoand enantioselective synthesis of various types of polysubstituted aminocyclobutanes and aminocyclopropanes through CuH-catalyzed hydroamination of 1-substituted cyclobutenes and cyclopropenes. These strained trisubstituted alkenes exhibit much higher reactivity compared to their unstrained analogues in the initial hydrocupration step of the reaction. Moreover, an interesting reversal of regioselectivity was observed in the hydroamination of 1-aryl-substituted cyclobutenes compared to the cyclopropene analogues. The origins of the enhanced reactivity of strained trisubstituted alkenes as well as the differences in the regio- and enantioselectivity between reactions with cyclobutenes and cyclopropenes were investigated computationally.									18	1	1	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100033	33664986

A phenol-substituted multiboron catalyst with a B-C-B structure outperformed simple arylboronic acids in the condensation of alpha-amino acids with suppressed epimerization of electrophiles. gem-diboronic acid catalysis were compatible with various O, N, and S-functionalized alpha-amino acids bearing N-protecting groups including common carbamates used in peptide synthesis (Boc, Cbz, Fmoc). N-trifluoroacetyl protection enabled an unprecedented catalytic dehydrative peptide synthesis at room temperature. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed carboxylate-binding nature of gem-diboronic acids, orthogonal to the activation of carboxylic acids by arylboronic acids. The distinctive reactivity of the gem-diboronic acids would open prospects for mild catalytic peptide condensation.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100073

Notably, the use of aryl-B(dan) in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction provides a complementary solution to the protodeboronation problems. The base KOt-Bu plays a crucial role for the promotion of these cross-coupling reactions as it enables the formation of a borate salt. This reaction protocol was extended to the one-pot sequential Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of 4-[(pin)B]C6H4-B(dan), wherein the "less reactive" aryl-B(dan) moiety was cross-coupled preferentially.									23	0	0	0	4	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100039

Through molybdenum-thiolate cooperation, the B-H bond of. BH3 is cleaved, affording a Mo(II)-H hydride (1H(BH2)) with the BH2 moiety captured at the S-Mo unit. In the presence of NH3, 1H(BH2) smoothly achieves the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitriles.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100043

Guided by the same concept, we have explored two transformations, namely, a Co-catalyzed cyclo-isomerization reaction and a Fe-catalyzed cyclization/Giese addition reaction. Both reactions involve the generation of a versatile alpha-siloxy radical intermediate via concomitant philicity inversion and radical translocation, which is mechanistically distinct from coupling reactions involving fragmentation/reduction pathways. Synthesis of cyclic silyl enol ethers and sterically congested cyclopentanol derivatives have been thus achieved with high regio- and diastereo-selectivity.									9	1	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100055

During the past decade, directing groups have revolutionized molecular synthesis in terms of ortho-selective C-H activation. In sharp contrast, a selectivity switch that guides the typical ortho- to remote meta-C-H activation has thus far proven elusive. Herein, we describe the realization of such a concept for a robust selectivity control in ruthenium catalysis. The distal C-H transformation was guided by key mechanistic insights into the mild, synergistic action of carboxylates and phosphines in ruthenium(II) catalysis. Our findings allowed remote selectivity in broadly effective late-stage diversification of structurally complex drugs and natural product molecules, tolerating sensitive fluorescent dyes, drugs, lipids, peptides, nucleosides, and carbohydrates.									26	0	0	0	5	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100049

By subtle tuning of the reaction conditions, both benzo- and simple five-membered heteroarenes are suitable substrates under similar but different conditions. The key is the right choice of a silver salt. The detailed mechanistic study discloses that the first C-H/C-H cross-coupling step involves an [Ir-II]-[Ir-IV] catalytic cycle, which needs Ag2O as the oxidant. For the second cyclization step, a radical process takes control in the reactions of benzoheteroarenes and Ag2O is required; however, a C-H cyclization functions in the reactions of simple five-membered heteroarenes involving an [Ir-I]-[Ir-III] catalytic cycle, and AgTFA is necessary.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100024

The method selectively produces secondary amines through a hydrogen borrowing mechanism and is successfully applied to several heterocyclic carbinol substrates. Under the reaction conditions, precatalyst 1 evolves through a series of catalytic intermediates: [(eta(6)-cymene)RuH((PyCH2PBu2)-Bu-t)]OTf (3), [Ru3H2Cl2(CO)((PyCH2PBu2)-Bu-t)(2){mu-(C5H3N)(CH2PBu2)-Bu-t}]OTf (4), and a diastereomeric pair of [Ru2HCl(CO)(2)((PyCH2PBu2)-Bu-t)(2)(mu-(O2CPr)-Pr-n)]X (trans-5, X = Cl; cis-6, X = OTf). The structures of 4 and 6 were established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A study of catalytic activity shows that 4 is a dormant (but alive) form of the catalyst, whereas 5 and 6 are the ultimate dead forms. Electrochemical studies show that 4 is redox active and undergoes electrochemically reversible one-electron oxidation at E-1/2 = 0.442 V (vs Fc(+)/Fc) in CH2Cl2 solution. We discuss the factors that govern the formation of 3-6 and the role of selective ruthenium carbonylation, which is essential for enabling generation of the active catalyst. We also connect these discoveries to the identification of conditions for amination of aliphatic alcohols, which eluded us until we understood the catalyst's complex speciation behavior.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100008

In this study, we rationally engineered a functional peroxidase with a catalytic binding site of guaiacol in a model protein, myoglobin (Mb), by replacing Phe46 with a serine (F46S mutation), together with a distal Tyr in the heme pocket (F43Y mutation). The double mutant F43Y/F46S Mb exhibited an overall catalytic efficiency that exceeds most natural peroxidases and is similar to the most efficient horseradish peroxidase. The catalytic substrate binding site was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy, and inhibition studies, as well as molecular docking simulations. Remarkably, this study reports an artificial peroxidase with an engineered catalytic binding site whose structure was solved both in the absence and presence of the substrate.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100096

To reveal how C-O bond coupling reductive elimination (RE) is stimulated by excited Ni-II [Welin, E. R.; Le, C.; Arias-Rotondo, D. M.; McCusker, J. K.; MacMillan, D. W. C. Science 2017, 355, 380], we report here high-level theoretical modellings based on a combined ab initio protocol (CASSCF, CASPT2, DLPNO-CCSD(T)). In contrast to the experimental proposal of the d-d excited state, we find that the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state is most likely to stimulate the C-O coupling RE. This unprecedented assignment of the reactive excited state not only obviates the known thermodynamic prohibition of C-O coupling by ground state Ni-II, but also matches the experimental triplet energy requisite for energy transfer. In addition, the enhanced RE reactivity in excited Ni-II can be well rationalized by the Ni-III character of the MLCT state. The resolution of this intriguing mechanistic puzzle in the excited-state chemistry of a Ni-II complex underscores the potential of multireference methods in this field.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100001

Because its substrate and product are both transient, the mechanistic insight is currently poor. Here, we decipher the catalytic cycle of onion LFS (AcLFS) by employing crystallography, biochemical assays, and molecular simulations. Crystal structures complexed with solute compounds demonstrate not only the properties of the catalytic site but also a potent binding mode of the labile substrate, a mode which can fulfill the "syn-effect" of the reaction. Mutagenesis analyses identified the key residues in the active site, and the kinetic and energetic backgrounds were specified with computational approaches. We present a rational catalytic mechanism based on the intramolecular proton shuttling that is distinct from the canonical [1,4]-sigmatropic rearrangement reaction. Our investigations both in vitro and in silico provide the mechanistic basis explaining how AcLFS generates the lachrymatory agent in nature and provide insights into the molecular machinery concerning organic labile sulfur species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100003		
J	Farhat, Rida; Dhainy, Jihan; Halaoui, Lara I.								OER Catalysis at Activated and Codeposited NiFe-Oxo/Hydroxide Thin Films Is Due to Postdeposition Surface-Fe and Is Not Sustainable without Fe in Solution								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			20	35		10.1021/acscatal.9b02580				JAN 3 2020	2020	This work examines by electrochemical measurements a hypothesis that low-coordination Fe on the surface (surface-Fe) of NiFe-oxo/hydroxide promotes catalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rather than Fe in the bulk structure (bulk-Fe) even in ultrathin films that are mostly surface. The effect of method of incorporation of Fe in Ni-oxo/hydroxide on the electrochemical behavior and OER activity is interrogated, and the sustainability of OER catalysis at NiFe-oxo/hydroxide is examined in the absence of Fe in solution. Ni(Fe)-oxo/hydroxide ultrathin films of a few monolayers and thicker films of tens of monolayers of Ni(OH)(2) were deposited at anodic bias from potassium borate buffer containing Ni nitrate or Ni and Fe nitrates at a 6:4 Ni:Fe ratio and were conditioned and studied in 1 M KOH containing Fe or purified from Fe. Fe was incorporated in NiFe-oxo/hydroxide during codeposition but removed from solution during conditioning and catalysis, was included postdeposition during conditioning and catalysis in Fe-containing solution, or was incorporated postdeposition by conditioning in Fe-containing solution and then removed from solution during catalysis. Ultrathin and thicker NiOxHy and Ni0.6Fe0.4OxHy films exhibited high OER currents and low Tafel slopes in the range of 40 mV/dec in 1 M KOH after activation that included Fe from solution. However, ultrathin and thicker codeposited Ni0.6Fe0.4OxHy films exhibited low OER currents in Fe-purified KOH, which further decreased with the application of anodic bias, and exhibited high Tafel slopes of ca. 100 mV/dec or higher, in a behavior similar to that of NiOxHy in Fe-free KOH. Fe included postdeposition or surface-Fe is therefore indicated to be responsible for high OER catalysis in ultrathin and thicker NiFe-oxo/hydroxide films. The sustainability of OER catalysis at postdeposition activated Ni(Fe)-oxo/hydroxide still required the presence of Fe in solution. NiOxHy films activated for OER postdeposition in Fe-containing electrolyte did not sustain their high OER catalysis in Fe-free KOH but were deactivated with potential cycling. An exchange that causes surface-Fe to move into higher coordination bulk-Fe is proposed to cause the loss of OER activity of activated NiFe-oxo/hydroxide in Fe-free electrolyte.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100004

Co-phosphate-based bifunctional materials can be a plausible option owing to the enhanced stability imparted by the phosphate group. Inspired by the possibility, we report solution combustion synthesized porous Na2CoPO4F as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Comparable to the existing conventional electrocatalysts, porous Na2CoPO4F exhibits robust bifunctional (ORR/OER) properties. Having F-based chemistry, the dissolution is minimal in an aqueous medium, paving a way for its use as a cathode for the aqueous rechargeable hybrid Na-air battery. Thus, based on the bifunctional catalytic performances and stability in an aqueous medium, this material can be envisaged as a cheap and an efficient catalyst for fuel cell as well as a cathode for metal-air batteries.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100006

It necessitates selective and energy-efficient electrocatalysts-a requirement met today only using noble metals such as gold and silver. Here, we show that the two-dimensional sulfur planes in semimetallic titanium disulfide (TiS2) provide an earth-abundant alternative. In situ Fourier transform infrared mechanistic studies reveal that CO2 binds to conductive disulfide planes as intermediate monothiocarbonate. The sulfur-CO2 intermediate state steers the reduction kinetics toward mainly CO. Using TiS2 thin films, we reach cathodic energy efficiencies up to 64% at 5 mA cm(2). We conclude with directions for the further synthesis and study of semimetallic disulfides developing CO-selective electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100009

Central to this advance is the use of the organic-soluble base, potassium trimethylsilanolate, which allows for a homogeneous, anhydrous cross coupling. The coupling proceeds at a rapid rate, often furnishing products in quantitative yield in less than 5 min. By applying this method, a >10-fold decrease in reaction time was observed for three published reactions which required >48 h to reach satisfactory conversion.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100010	33585070

Using in situ spectroelectrochemistry, we present herein a comprehensive discussion on the structural and morphological evolution of MOFs (zeolitic imidazolate framework-67, ZIF-67) during both cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. Dramatic morphological changes exposing electron-accessible Co sites are evident. The intense conversion from tetrahedral Co sites in ZIF-67 to tetrahedral alpha-Co(OH)(2) and octahedral beta-Co(OH)(2), and the formation of their corresponding oxidized forms (CoOOH), is observed during both the electrochemical treatments. Subsequent oxygen evolution reaction suggests the CoOOH produced from alpha/beta-Co(OH)(2) as the dominating active sites, not the metal nodes of ZIF-67. Specifically, the CoOOH from alpha-Co(OH)(2) is most active (turnover frequency = 0.59 s(-1)) compared to that from beta-Co(OH)(2) (0.06 s(-1)). Our study demonstrates the importance of examining the electrochemical stability of MOFs for electrocatalyst design.									65	0	0	0	4	0	65			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100011

Their activities quite depend on the amount of exposed active sites (e.g., Cu-oxide interfaces), which can be tuned by the particle size as well as porosity. Here, we report an active, selective, and stable Cu@ZrOx catalyst with a three-dimensional (3D) porous framework structure via the in situ reconstruction of size-confined Cu@UiO-66. The optimized CU-0.5-300 catalyst shows a high methanol selectivity of 78.8% at a conversion of 13.1% at 260 degrees C, 4.5 MPa, giving a methanol space-time yield of 796 g.kg(cat)(-1).h(-1). It also shows long-term stability for 105 h in a time-on-stream test. Such good performance benefits from abundant Cu-ZrOx interfaces and a stable 3D ZrOx framework. During the reaction, ZrOx species in situ evolves from the unstable Zr-oxide cluster (the building unit of UiO-66) or amorphous ZrO2 to a stable tetragonal ZrO2 phase, but strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) at Cu-ZrOx interfaces retains. The SMSI enables the formation of Cu+ at the ZrO2 surface, which is strongly associated with the active sites for methanol synthesis. In situ diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy studies reveal methanol synthesis which follows a HCOO-intermediated pathway. It is believed that this work provides an "in situ reconstruction" strategy to fabricate a practical Cu@ZrOx framework catalyst for methanol production.									23	3	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100012

In many studies, TiO2 has been successfully used as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction, but there is still a lack of understanding of its catalytic behavior. In this context, CO2 reduction has been studied on nanoporous TiO2 electrodes in acetonitrile media by means of (spectro) electrochemical methods (ATR-IR and UV-vis). Importantly, the onset of the cathodic Faradaic processes related with CO2 reduction on TiO2 electrodes is located at -0.81 V versus SHE, which is less negative than that observed for metal electrodes under similar conditions. UV-vis spectroelectrochemical results indicate that the electrocatalytic behavior of TiO2 is related to the generation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ sites at its surface and promoted by electrolytes with nonintercalating cations in agreement with recent results on WO3 electrodes. ATR-IR spectroelectrochemical measurements allow for monitoring of the TiO2/solution interfacial state as reduction proceeds. Specifically, IR bands for carbon monoxide and carbonyl groups related with carbonate and oxalate are observed. Additionally, a chromatographic analysis shows CO and oxalate as main products. With controlled water addition (0.5 M), methanol and CO were found to be the main products. Based on these results, a mechanism for CO2 reduction on TiO2 electrodes is presented in which the regeneration of the TiO2 surface by oxide electrodissolution/deposition is a critical step.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100013

Catalytic reactions featuring intramolecular C-H amidation of alkyl carboxamide substrates could provide a straightforward disconnection strategy for beta-lactam synthesis. Herein, we report a streamlined method for asymmetric synthesis of beta-aryl beta-lactams from propanoic acid and aryl iodides via Pd-catalyzed sequential C(sp(3))-H functionalization. The lactam-forming reaction provides an example of Pd-II-catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular C(sp(3))-H amidation reaction and proceeds up to 94% ee. The use of a 2-methoxy-5-chlorophenyl iodide oxidant is critical to control the competing reductive elimination pathways of the Pd-IV intermediate to achieve the desired chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that both steric and electronic effects of the unconventional aryl iodide oxidant are responsible for controlling the competing C-N versus C-C reductive elimination pathways of the Pd-IV intermediate.									22	1	0	0	5	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100014

However, many candidate nonprecious metal catalysts bind hydrogen with similar strengths but exhibit orders-of-magnitude lower activity for this reaction. In this study, we employ electronic structure methods that allow fully potential-dependent reaction barriers to be calculated, in order to develop a complete working picture of hydrogen evolution on platinum. Through the resulting ab initio microkinetic models, we assess the mechanistic origins of Pt's high activity. Surprisingly, we find that the G similar to 0 hydrogen atoms are inert in the kinetically relevant region and that the active hydrogen atoms have Delta G's much weaker, similar to that of gold. These on-top hydrogens have particularly low barriers, which we compare to those of gold, explaining the high reaction rates, and the exponential variations in coverage lead directly to Pt's strong kinetic response to the applied potential. This explains the unique reactivity of Pt that is missed by conventional Sabatier analyses and suggests true design criteria for nonprecious alternatives.									59	0	0	0	1	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100015

In this work, N-doped carbon nanotubes were employed to catalyze the oxidation of styrene (SOR) with tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. We observed a significant enhancement of SOR activity caused by the incorporation of nitrogen dopants when the N content was lower than 3.51% but a decline of activity at higher N contents. At N content up to 7.51%, even worse performance than that on N-doped carbon nanotubes with 0.98% N content was observed. This behavior was rationalized by thorough density functional theory calculations. Different catalytic functions of N-P and N-G were revealed. More significantly, a synergistic effect between N-P and N-G was demonstrated when they are quite close, which is unbeneficial for the catalytic activity due to the very high energy barriers. The finding may pave a way to the rational design of high-performance metal-free carbon catalysts.									18	2	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100016

Its activity is substantially altered by aspirin, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that irreversibly inhibits COX-2 by acetylation of its Ser530 residue. So far, it has been widely accepted that in the aspirin-acetylated COX-2, PGG(2) synthesis is blocked, whereas the acetylated enzyme still catalyzes the formation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 15R-HETE as the main product. However, recent experiments detected residual COX activity in recombinant human acetylated COX-2 with formation of prostaglandins, a surprising result that could not be rationalized. In fact, a complete molecular understanding of aspirin action is still lacking, and contradictory explanations have been given for the formation of the highly controlled stereochemical products. We have combined here molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations to study each step of the aspirin-inhibited catalytic mechanism. Our results confirm that 15R-HPETE (then reduced to 15R-HETE) is the main product of the AA oxidation catalyzed by aspirin-acetylated COX-2, being clearly more favorable than the formation of 15S-HPETE. The 15R-HPETE synthesis is kinetically dominant and inhibits the formation of the (9R, 11R) bicyclo endoperoxides to give PGH(2), which can still be obtained as a minor product, as detected experimentally. Instead, the synthesis of isoprostanes does not happen because it is not kinetically competitive at all with the formation of 15R-HETE.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100017

While ketyl radical reactivity of aldehydes by photoredox has been well-established, herein, we have now revealed a pathway for umpolung addition of aldehydes with or without external reductant. Hence, the reductive alkylations and challenging benzylations of nitrogen heteroarenes (i.e., Minisci reactions) are enabled by the bromide-promoted visible light-mediated photocatalysis. The present protocol offers a mild, viable method for late-stage alkylations and transition-metal-free benzylations of biologically active nitrogen-heteroarene molecules. Mechanistic studies are indicative of a bromide-initiated acyl radical mechanism in the absence of external reductant.									42	2	0	0	8	0	42			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100018

In this work, polynitrogen (N-8(-)) deposited on boron-doped graphene (PN-BG) and graphene (PN-G) was synthesized experimentally by a facile cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. It was further used for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which showed superior activity via a four-electron pathway mechanism. BG was prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. Characterizations over BG substrate, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman specstroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, demonstrated that boron atoms were successfully doped into graphene matrix. The formation of polynitrogen (N-8(-)) on BG was confirmed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption. A larger amount of N-8(-) was obtained on boron-doped graphene than that on graphene. Rotating disk electrode measurements indicated that PN-BG showed higher current density than PN-G catalyst because of the larger amount of N-8(-) on BG. Compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst, PN-B1G has much better methanol tolerance. Kinetics study was also carried out to investigate the ORR pathway. Natural bonding orbital analysis confirmed the mechanism. This work provides a facile strategy to modify graphene structure and efficiently stabilize N-8(-) on a graphene-based matrix.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100019

In particular, the SLIR method can also be used to identify single-atom active sites in heterogeneous catalysis.

Despite common structural features in their dinuclear active site, i.e., a thiolate-rich coordination sphere and CO/CN- ligation, the synergetic way, in which the two metal sites act during catalysis, is specific for each enzyme. With the aim of understanding the role of the nature of the metal (Fe vs Ni), we report on a homodinuclear FeFe complex, a parent of a previously reported NiFe complex, to compare their electrocatalytic activity for H-2 production. The di-iron complex [(CO)-(LFeII)-Fe-N2S2-Fe-II (CO)Cpr (with L-N2S2 = 2,2'-(2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-diyObis(1,1-diphenylethanethiolate and Cp = cyclopentadienyl) has been synthesized and fully characterized. In the solid state, it contains two CO ligands: one bound to the {FeCp} moiety in a semibridging manner and one terminally bound to the {FeLN2S2} moiety. This dinuclear iron complex is thus not isostructural to [(LNiFeII)-Ni-N2S2-Fe-II(CO)Cp](+), which contains a single CO ligand terminally bound to the Fe site. However, at low concentrations in MeCN solutions, the CO ligand coordinated to the {FeLN2S2} moiety is removed and the CO ligand bound to the {FeCp} moiety becomes fully bridging between the two Fe sites. Under such conditions, the di-iron complex displays similar catalytic performances to the parent NiFe complex (a comparable overpotential, i = 730 and 690 mV, and TON = 15 and 16, respectively). Cyclic voltammetry data give direct experimental evidence for an E[ECEC] mechanism, which was also previously proposed for the NiFe complex. However, the structure of the one-electron reduced species, the entry point of the catalytic cycle, slightly differs for the two systems: in [(LNiI)-Ni-N2S2 (CO)(FeCp)-Cp-II], this is valence localized species on the site Ni and the CO ligand bridges the two metal ions, while in [(CO)L(N2S2F)eFeCp], this is a type II-III mixed-valence species with the CO terminally bound to the {FeLN2S2} unit.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100021

We recently demonstrated that certain flavins (FLs) are potent redox photo-catalysts capable of converting Pt-IV anticancer prodrug complexes into Pt-II drugs in the biological environment. Herein, we investigate the mechanism of these artificial photocatalytic reactions employing four different free flavins, namely, riboflavin (Rf), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), tetra-O-acetyl riboflavin (TARF) and lumiflavin (Lf), and the flavoprotein miniSOG (mini Singlet Oxygen Generator), together with a panel of Pt-IV substrates conveniently selected. NMR, steady-state, and time-resolved optical spectroscopy studies highlight that light activation of FLs in the presence of NADH as electron donor (pH 7-7.5) eventually leads to the generation of the reduced FLH- species which catalyzes the Pt-IV-to-Pt-II conversion with turnover frequency (TOF) values ranging between 1.3 and 30 min(-1) and turnover number (TON) values reaching 500. Comparable catalytic efficiency is also found for reactions performed in cell culture medium. Density functional theory suggests that activation via reduction of the Pt-IV complexes may be influenced by H-bonding interactions between the FL catalyst and the metal substrate and confirms that both the isoalloxazine and ribityl moieties of the FLs determine the catalytic efficiency of the process. The FMN-containing miniSOG is a less effective catalyst (TOFs < 5.6 min(-1)) because the formation of the doubly reduced FMNH- competes with an electron transfer reaction involving the protein matrix which quenches the FMN excited state to give a singly reduced FMN center dot-.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100022

This simple strategy features wide functional group tolerance, good reproducibility, and preparative scale utility. The manganese catalyst plays a crucial role in this C-H activation protocol, enabling high selectivity with previously challenging internal alkynes. Furthermore, the synthetic value of the method is highlighted by diverse postsynthesis functionalizations of the final products.									31	0	0	0	6	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100023

However, the rational design of photocatalysts is often hampered by the mechanistic complexity and low modularity of the catalyst structure. Herein, we demonstrate a photophysical study of diverging photocatalytic pathways that guides the design of organic acridinium catalysts to complement polypyridyl transition metal systems. A combined halogen metal exchange/directed ortho-metalation provides reagents for a broad range of modular acridinium catalysts with fine-tuned photophysical and photochemical properties such as excited-state lifetimes, redox potentials, and photostabilities poised to refine organocatalytic photoredox methodology.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100025

We describe herein the development of the reaction, exploration of the substrate scope, and studies on the reaction mechanism. The intramolecular coupling reaction leads to the formation of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanones with a quaternary carbon bridgehead in synthetically useful yields (up to 98%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 er) and good functional group tolerance (>30 examples). Significantly, aryl and alkenyl bromides as well as less reactive triflates are all compatible substrates for this process. The synthetic versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by scale-up synthesis and diverse transformations of the products into valuable building blocks, including quaternary center-containing dihydronaphthalenes, ring-fused indoles and lactones, tetralones, and 6,6,5-tricycles. Mechanistic studies by computational calculations provide insights into the role of benzylamine in accelerating the reaction rate and enhancing the enantioselectivities.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100026

Though these advances in performance have been important for demonstrating the feasibility of the technology, nearly all AEMFCs reported in the literature have required a relatively high loading of platinum group metal (PGM)-based catalysts at both the anode and cathode electrode to achieve even adequate, let alone exemplary, performance. However, in order to take command of the low-temperature fuel cell market, AEMFCs cannot simply reach the same performance as incumbent proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which have had decades of development and investment. AEMFCs must be able to realize their most widely quoted advantage over PEMFCs and be produced at a much lower cost than PEMFCs. In the long run, the most likely pathway to acceptably low cost AEMFCs will involve the deployment of PGM-free catalysts at both electrodes. In this Viewpoint, we will discuss what we believe are the most promising approaches to achieve PGM-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (AEMFC cathode) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (AEMFC anode), as well as provide our perspective on key issues that must be addressed to craft these catalysts into high-performing, durable electrodes.									57	1	0	0	3	0	57			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100027

Here we report the fabrication of Zn-doped NiFeOxHy (Zn;NiFeOxHy) that has advanced electrocatalytic activity and stability in comparison to pure NiFeOxHy in the OER via simple chemical bath deposition and electrochemical activation. The improvement with Zn;NiFeOxHy is due to the Zn2+ dopant, a strong Lewis acid that modulates its electronic property for better intermediate binding for the electrochemical process, resulting in the stabilization of the OER-active phase. This work opens up an opportunity to elucidate the detailed mechanism of NiFeOxHy-based electrocatalysts and improves our understanding of redox tuning through inductive effects, thereby leading to advanced OER catalyst developments.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100028

The whole catalytic cycle has been verified to be a biomimetic approach through the formation of the alloxan hydroperoxide reactive intermediate.

ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			253	264		10.1021/acscatal.9b01925				JAN 3 2020	2020	We use density functional theory calculations to study a group of 213 materials known as MXenes toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia. So far, all computational studies have only considered the NRR chemistry on unfunctionalized (bare) MXenes. In this study, we investigate a total of 65 bare and functionalized MXenes. We establish free energy diagrams for the NRR on the basal planes of 55 different M2XTx MXenes (M = Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W; X = C, N) to span a large variety of possible chemistries. Energy trends with respect to the metal as well as nonmetal constituent of the MXenes are established for both bare and functionalized MXenes. We determine the limiting potentials and find that either the formation of NH3 from *NH2 or the formation of *N2H is the potential limiting reaction step for bare and functionalized MXenes, respectively. We find several Mo-, W-, and V-based MXenes (Mo2C, Mo2N, W2N, W2NH2, and V2N) to have suitable theoretical overpotentials for the NRR. Importantly, calculated Pourbaix stability diagrams combined with selectivity analysis, however, reveal that all bare MXenes are not stable under relevant NRR operating conditions. The only functionalized MXene with the three minimum required properties (i) having a low theoretical overpotential, (ii) being stable under NRR conditions, and (iii) having selectivity toward NRR rather than the parasitic HER is W2CH2, which is a H-terminated MXene. Finally, on the basis of our findings, we explore other routes for improving the NRR chemistry by studying 10 additional MXenes with the chemical formula M3X2Tx and MXenes with other functional groups (T-x = S, F, Cl). This opens up a larger variety and tunability of MXenes to be considered for the NRR.									44	3	0	0	1	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100030		
J	Taitt, Brandon J.; Bender, Michael T.; Choi, Kyoung-Shin								Impacts of the Regeneration Pathways of the Oxoammonium Cation on Electrochemical Nitroxyl Radical-Mediated Alcohol Oxidation								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			265	275		10.1021/acscatal.9b03241				JAN 3 2020	2020	Recent studies investigating the electrocatalytic properties of nitroxyl radicals (e.g. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)) for electrochemical alcohol oxidation have demonstrated that the thermodynamic equilibrium oxidation potential and the steric environments unique to each nitroxyl radical have significant implications for their electrocatalytic abilities for alcohol oxidation. However, as the catalytic cycle of the nitroxyl radical involves not only the production and use of the oxoammonium cation for alcohol oxidation but also the regeneration of the oxoammonium cation from the hydroxylamine, the mechanism and rate of the regeneration of the oxoammonium cation critically affect the overall rate of electrochemical nitroxyl radical-mediated alcohol oxidation. Currently, a detailed understanding of this important aspect is lacking. Herein, the factors that affect the regeneration pathways of the oxoammonium cation are systematically investigated, and the impact that the regeneration pathways have on the overall catalytic activity for electrochemical alcohol oxidation is demonstrated. In this study, 4-acetamido TEMPO and 2-azaadamantane-N-oxyl, which are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of nitroxyl radical derivatives in terms of thermodynamic driving force and steric effects, are used as example nitroxyl radicals. As such, the results and discussion provided in this study can be used as comprehensive guidelines to understand the catalytic activity and regeneration pathways of any TEMPO derivative or polycyclic nitroxyl radical during electrochemical alcohol oxidation.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100031

Starting with the chiral ferrocenyl acetals, 1-[(2S,4S)-4-methoxymethyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl]-1',2',3',4',5'-R-5-ferrocenes ((-)-3b, R = Me; (-)-3c, R = Ph; (-)-3d, R = Bn), N-tosylamino and formyl groups were introduced at the 1- and 2-positions of the ferrocene cores in (S)-11b-d with control of the planar chirality. After the reaction with ethynylmagnesium bromide, generated propargyl alcohol derivatives (S)-17 were treated with MnO2 and catalytic tetrabutylammonium iodide to give the planar-chiral pyridones by the iodide-catalyzed cyclization. This method is highly practical with a shorter and higher-yield sequence without using noble metal catalysts. Planar-chiral ferroco-pyridones (S)-2b-d were reacted with various Me3SiNR2 compounds to give a library of ferrocene-fused 4-dialkylaminopyridines ((S)-1, DAAPs) in high yields as single enantiomers by the detosylative amination. The cymantrene-fused DAAPs were also prepared in the same way. The library of chiral DAAPs was examined in the two asymmetric reactions as organocatalysts, and some newly prepared Fc-DAAPs showed better enantioselectivity than the known species.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100034

However, bifunctional catalysts suffer from low productivity due to the inertness of CO2 and high activation energy of C-C coupling. Herein, we report a highly active bifunctional catalyst consisting of a ZnO-ZrO2 aerogel and zeolite H-ZSM-5 for the hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics with 76% selectivity at a singlepass CO2 conversion of 16%. The selectivity of CH4 is lower than 1% at the same time. The space-time yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is as high as 0.24 g g(oxide)(-1) h(-1) under the reaction conditions of 340 degrees C and 40 bar over ae-ZnO-ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, which outperforms the previously reported catalysts, including modified Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. We demonstrate that the ZnO-ZrO2 aerogel catalyst, which is prepared by a combined sol-gel and subsequent supercritical drying method, not only possesses high surface area but also provides large amounts of oxygen vacancies. The formation rate of the methanol intermediate over ZnO-ZrO2 is dominated by the total amount of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the stable performance of the bifunctional catalyst under industrially relevant conditions suggests promising prospects for industrial applications.									55	5	0	0	2	0	60			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100035

Conventional methodologies to prepare these chemicals, however, suffer from using toxic, corrosive starting materials and/or employing harsh reaction conditions. Recent advances suggest that heterogeneous catalysts are promising to promote the formation of organonitrogen chemicals from cheap and abundant materials. In this Review, we summarize the most recent developments using supported solid catalysts to make organonitrogen chemicals from oxygen-containing feedstock and NH3. We introduce four key transformations including carbonyls/alcohols to amines, alcohols/carbonyls to nitriles, alcohols/nitriles to amides, and alcohols/carbonyls to N-heterocycles. In each section, the function of the catalyst and the structure activity correlations are discussed. Auxiliary factors affecting the performance of the catalysts, such as solvent effect, substituent group effect, and/or reactor design are also reviewed.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100036

However, the exploration of its utility in homogeneous catalysis is currently far less reported. In this work, we have investigated the transferability of the concept of scaling relations to a homogeneous catalysis reaction known as the Buchwald-Hartwig amination (BHA) reaction. The reaction of PhBr with MeNH2 using 37 different Pd-L complexes (L = phosphine ligand) is studied, and scaling relations are established among the reaction intermediates and transition states. Using the scaling relations, we construct volcano plots, which is the plot of the log(rate) vs the descriptor intermediate energy. The insights from the volcano plots agree well with the experimental trends from the literature and give direction toward better catalyst design.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100037

The achievement of excellent activity and high Faradaic efficiency in a wide potential range is critical for mature applications. To this regard, we first employed density functional theory simulations to predict activity of Bi nanotubes and Bi nanosheets to CO2RR and selectivity toward formate. The theoretical thermodynamic analysis of the reaction energetics suggests that the limiting potential for CO2 reduction to HCOOH decreases with the increase of the curvature, suggesting a wider potential window of Bi nanotubes for formate formation. Then, Bi nanotubes with highly curved surface were experimentally prepared, showing a large current density (-39.4 mA cm(-2) at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) for CO2 reduction and a maximum formate selectivity of 97% at -1.0 V vs RHE. More importantly, compared with Bi nanosheets, an appreciable selectivity for formate was achieved on Bi nanotubes in a significantly wider potential window of similar to 600 mV (selectivity > 80%). This research provides not only the CO2RR activity-surface structure relationship of metallic Bi but also an efficient strategy for the rational design of electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity in a wide potential window for CO2RR, which is favorable for compatible application with varied types of photovoltaics and other renewable energy sources.									61	0	0	0	2	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100040

Transition-metal-promoted Mo-based catalysts (M/MoO3/SiO2) showed different selectivity patterns from the transition metal supported on silica (M/SiO2). All molybdenum-based catalysts displayed a similar selectivity pattern, consisting of 15-20% of CH4, 30-40% of C2+ hydrocarbons, and 35-40% of oxygenates. The addition of transition metals to molybdenum oxide promoted the catalytic activity by an order of magnitude. Temperature program reduction indicated hydrogen spillover from the transition metals to molybdenum species. H-2-D-2 exchange rate measurements showed that the addition of the transition metal enhanced the rate of H-2 dissociation on the catalyst. CO chemisorption measurements indicated that transition-metal-promoted molybdenum catalysts consist of a similar amount of strong adsorption sites, which may originate from the reduced transition metal, and weak adsorption sites, which may originate from reduced molybdenum oxides. A dual-site mechanism is suggested in which low-valent molybdenum species dissociate CO and generate CHx groups that are hydrogenated to hydrocarbons or react with adsorbed CO on higher-valent Mo sites to form higher alcohols. Ni, Co, and Ru are able to generate CHx groups and enhance the production of C2+ oxygenates, whereas all of the transition metals studied are able to provide sites for H-2 dissociation and H spillover to molybdenum oxide, leading to further enhancement in catalytic activity compared to MoOx/SiO2.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100041

Ni catalysis of activation of C-H bonds of methane to H-2 and C is well-known. We have tried to control the catalysis of Ni via the addition of second elements and found silica-supported nickel phosphide (Ni-P/SiO2) materials as active catalysts for the DCM reaction at 1173 K. The products included C2H4 (ethylene), C2H6 (ethane), C2H2 (acetylene), C3H6 (propylene), C6H6 (benzene), C7H8 (toluene), and C10H8 (naphthalene). The formation of Ni2P on silica was determined using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Pure Ni2P material without support showed a fine catalytic activity for the DCM reaction. Almost the same activation energies of the Ni2P (249 kJ mol(-1)) and Ni-P/SiO2 catalysts (251 kJ mol(-1)) were obtained in the conversion rate of methane, which were lower than that of SiO2 (365 kJ mol(-1)). This indicated that Ni2P was the activate phase for the DCM reaction. The Ni2P phase activates C-H bonds of methane and converts to ethane. Other higher hydrocarbons were produced from ethane in the gas phase at 1173 K.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100042

Given the high reactivity of alpha-OH carbonyls, the main challenge was control of selectivity in a cascade of parallel and consecutive reactions during reductive amination. The type of solvent and catalyst, preferably methanol and Pd, respectively, are key enabling parameters to achieve high product yields. A kinetic study on product intermediates accompanied with detailed product analysis (MS and NMR) suggested a general mechanistic scheme and validation with density functional theory calculations provided a rational understanding of the solvent effect in terms of energetics and kinetics. Primary alkanolamines (AA) such as 2-(dimethylamino)-ethanol are preferred products, and large excess of the amine reagent is not required to reach almost quantitative yields. Interestingly substoichiometric amine-to-GA ratio allows for high yield of higher (consecutive) AAs such as N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and triethanolamine, for which a peculiar cyclic 5-membered oxazolidinic precursor was analyzed (e.g., for reaction with monomethylamine to MDEA). The shift to diamine-selective (DA) reactions is possible by switching to a two-step one-pot approach. With ethylene glycol as a preferred solvent, high yield of an unsaturated C-2-enediamine precursor is obtained under an inert atmosphere, followed by its metal-catalyzed hydrogenation at elevated temperature to the final DA product such as N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene-diamine. A conceptual model of the catalytic reductive amination routes that allows production of a variety of ethylamines with up to +90 C % yield is thus presented. The successful preparation and sensory assessment of a GA-based diester quat in fabric softener formulations demonstrates the viability of a full bio-based and drop-in production route for high-value chemicals, directly from GA as a platform molecule.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100044

This approach represents a rare example of harnessing challenging tertiary radicals in photoredox/nickel cross-coupling. Oxetanes are often employed in medicinal chemistry as carbonyl or gem-dimethyl bioisosteres, but their accessibility is hampered by the lack of practical synthetic methods. The strategy reported here utilizes a readily available oxetanyl amino acid building block in a cross-coupling manifold to rapidly access oxetane scaffolds with broad functional group tolerance. Computational studies reveal that a catalytic cycle beginning with Ni(0)-Ni(II) oxidative addition, rather than radical addition to Ni(0), is operative for reactions with aminooxetanyl radicals. Consequently, for radical-based photoredox/nickel-catalyzed cross-couplings, the preferred mechanistic pathway has a fundamental dependence on the identity of the radical.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100045

To maximize reactivity toward both entails limiting the catalyst size while maintaining reactivity and avoiding aggregation. Frame-like hollow nanostructures (nanoframes) provide the required open structure with sufficient channels into the interior volume. We demonstrate here the design and synthesis of CoP nanoframes (CoP NFs) by a strategy involving precipitation, chemical etching, and low-temperature phosphidation steps. It results in impressive bifunctional catalytic activities for both HER and OER and consequently enables a highly efficient water electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) driven by a cell voltage of only 1.65 V. The strategy has been generalized for the preparation of nanoframe Co dichalcogenides CoX2 NFs, with X = S, Se, and Te. The results of electrochemical measurements, supported by density functional theory calculations, show that HER catalytic activities for the series follow the sequence: CoP NFs > CoSe2 NFs > CoS2 NFs > CoTe2 NFs.									115	3	0	0	5	0	116			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100046

Highly active transition-metal/metal oxides are considered promising materials for protecting the silicon surface, as they exhibit efficient catalytic properties which can reduce overpotential, thus improving the water splitting efficiency. In this study, electrodeposition, a simple and inexpensive method in comparison to vacuum processes such as atomic layer deposition and sputtering, was used to produce efficient Co-based catalysts on silicon substrates to fabricate photoanodes for the oxidation of water to generate oxygen. Distinctive morphologies of the Co-based catalysts were obtained by changing the types of additives in the precursor solution. The PEC performances of n-Si photoanodes with amorphous CoOx nanowalls (NWs) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) depended on the thicknesses and coverages of the catalysts. A fully covered CoOx NWs/n-Si photoanode exhibited stability higher than that of a partially covered Co NPs/n-Si photoanode. The optimized CoOx NWs/n-Si photoanode exhibited an onset potential of 1.06 +/- 0.01 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a photocurrent density of 23.3 +/- 0.8 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE. A charge injection efficiency of almost 100% at 1.4 V vs RHE and high external quantum efficiency of 90% at 700 nm were achieved. These results show that morphology-controlled transition-metal-based catalysts fabricated by the facile electrodeposition method can be one of the promising pathways for the design of high-performance Si-based photoanodes.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100047

Here, inspired by the principle of galvanic cells, we report a generalized spontaneous strategy involving the growth of Cu on M-c ((-) bulk Cu(s) vertical bar Cu2+(c) vertical bar monolayer Cu/M(s) (+)) and the displacement of Cu by Pt (Cu + PtCl42- = Pt + Cu2+ + 4Cl(-)) to synthesize McPtqms. Exemplified by PdcPtqms, we demonstrate that this method requires no special control, electrochemical equipment, or reducing/stabilizing agents, which allows for the scalable preparation of McPtqms. Meanwhile, it is able to produce homogeneous Pt-qms, leading to high electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. This work paves the way for the practical application of McPtqms in electrocatalytic and related fields.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100048

Herein, dilute PdxAu1-x alloy nanoparticles embedded in raspberry colloid-templated silica (x = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.09) are demonstrated to be highly active and selective for the gas-phase hydrogenation of 1-hexyne, exhibiting higher selectivity than pure Pd at high conversion. The conversion of 1-hexyne remains high even for the very low amounts of Pd in Pd0.02Au0.98. These catalysts are highly resistant to sintering-addressing a long-standing challenge in the use of Au-based catalysts. Clear evidence is presented that the addition of the second hydrogen to the half-hydrogenated intermediate is the rate-limiting step and that the stability of the half-hydrogenated intermediate of the alkyne is higher than the half-hydrogenated alkene, which explains the high selectivity even at high conversions. Moreover, of the three compositions investigated, optimum selectivity and activity are observed for the nanoparticles containing 4% Pd. The apparent activation energy for production of 1-hexene from 1-hexyne is measured to be 38 kJ mol(-1) for the Pd0.04Au0.96 catalysts, which is similar to 14 kJ mol(-1) lower than for pure Pd. The hydrogenation is completely, but reversibly, suppressed by adding CO to the reactant mixture, indicating that the Pd centers are the active sites for reaction. The method of templating used in preparation of the catalysts is highly customizable and versatile. This study demonstrates that the composition of the nanoparticles as defined by the dilution ratio of Pd in Au and by the method used to make the supported catalyst is an important tunable parameter that can be used to optimize activity and selectivity of bimetallic systems.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100050

Presently, Pd-based catalysts have demonstrated good acetylene conversion (X-C2H2), however, at the expense of ethylene selectivity (S-C2H4). In this study, we have employed a systematic approach using density functional theory (DFT) to identify the best catalyst in a Cu-Pt system. The DFT results showed that with a 55 atom system at similar to 1.1 Pt/Cu ratio for Pt28Cu27/Al2O3, the d-band center shifted -2.2 eV relative to the Fermi level leading to electron-saturated Pt, which allows only adsorption of ethylene via a pi-bond, resulting in theoretical 99.7% S-C2H4 at nearly complete X-C2H2. Based on the DFT results, Pt-Cu/Al2O3 (PtCu) and Pt/Al2O3 (Pt) nanocatalysts were synthesized via cluster beam deposition (CBD), and their properties and activities were correlated with the computational predictions. For bimetallic PtCu, the electron microscopy results show the formation of alloys. The bimetallic PtCu catalyst closely mimics the DFT predictions in terms of both electronic structure, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and catalytic activity. The alloying of Pt with Cu was responsible for the high C2H4 specific yield resulting from electron transfer between Cu and Pt, thus making PtCu a promising catalyst for SHA.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100051

Herein, the rhodium phosphide (RhPx) nanospecies as cocatalyst is firmly mounted on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets to realize the improved activity and stability for photocatalytic H-2 production. The maximum H-2 production rate over RhPx/g-C3N4 driven by visible light diplays a 5.6-fold improvement compared with Pt/g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the apparent quantum efficiency of 18.4% is achieved at a fixed wavelength of 420 nm that far exceeds the reported g-C3N4 modified with other single-transition-metal phosphides. Particularly, RhPx/g-C3N4 can maintain consistently stable H-2 production when enduring over 25 cyclic reactions with a total of 100 h. The deep insight into the modification effect of RhPx nanospecies reveals that it dramatically facilitates migration and separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and heightens interaction at the heterointerfaces between RhPx nanospecies and g-C3N4 nanosheets. This contribution extends the broad potential application of transition-metal phosphides as cocatalysts in the photocatalytic conversion from solar to hydrogen energy.									95	3	0	0	15	0	95			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100052

In general, the in situ electrochemical transformations of non-oxide catalysts are faster than those of the corresponding oxides, and they typically display improved OER activity. Although many approaches for tuning the active surfaces of catalysts as well as investigations into their roles in the mechanism of adsorption of OER intermediates have been reported, we still have a poor understanding of the dominant active sites formed during the OER. This review highlights current progress into the in situ electrochemical tuning with non-oxide catalysts (especially chalcogenides and pnictides) and offers a comprehensive summary of approaches for the enhancement of OER activity. We describe the non-oxide catalysts that have exhibited promising OER performance with strong in situ electrochemical tuning. We also discuss the preoxidation peak positions of the catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, we explore the probability of new active surface formation on non-oxide catalysts with modified OER mechanisms and the collections of available in situ and ex situ methods to identify the active sites in real-time. Finally, we discuss the challenges affecting the future detection of the active sites of the most promising OER catalysts.									62	1	0	0	4	0	63			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100053

Transition-metal catalysts, particularly those based on Pd, are effective in removing NO3-/NO2- through reduction to N-2 or NH4+. Pd is regarded as the most effective metal for NO3-/NO2- reduction, and as such, few studies have thoroughly explored the performance of other transition metals as a function of varying reaction conditions. In this work, we investigated the NO2- reduction properties of alumina-supported Rh using Pd as a benchmark, where we varied the bulk solution pH to probe the effect of reaction conditions on the catalytic chemistry. Pd expectedly showed a high reduction activity (289 L/g-surface-metal/min) and a high N2 selectivity (>99% at 20% conversion) at low pH and near inactivity at high pH. Surprisingly, the Rh catalyst, while inactive at low pH, showed moderate activity (22 L/g-surface-metal/min) and high NH4+ selectivity (>90% at 20% conversion) at high pH. Hydrazine (N2H4) was also detected as a reaction intermediate when NH4+ was formed. Microkinetic models built with energetics from density functional theory reveal that Rh catalysts are poisoned by NO* at low pH because of the rapid dissociative adsorption of protonated nitrite (HNO2) under acidic conditions, which was confirmed by in aqua surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. NO* poisoning of the Rh surface lessens at increased solution pH because NO2- does not dissociate as readily compared to HNO2, which explains why Rh exhibits higher activity in basic solutions. The microkinetic models further elucidate the competition between N2H4 and NH3/NH4+ formation as a function of pH, where we find that hydrogen surface coverage dictates product selectivity. These results update the common view that only Pd-based catalysts are effective for NO2- reduction and suggest unexplored avenues for nitrogen chemistry.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100054

This study investigates the performance of various noble metals supported on different carriers to identify important parameters for the design of selective catalytic systems. Iridium emerges as the most active and selective metal, and the performance is shown to be strongly influenced by the choice of carrier. Specifically, when supported on TiO2-rutile (TiO2-r), a 2-fold increase in the reaction rate and unprecedented CH3Cl selectivity (<= 95%) are observed, outperforming carriers such as SiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, CeO2, and MgO, as well as TiO2-anatase, which all exhibit comparable activity and selectivity patterns (<= 38% CH3Cl). Moreover, Ir/TiO2-r displays a lower deactivation rate (<= 2.5 times) with respect to other supported systems. Microscopy analysis reveals that the epitaxial growth of IrO2 on TiO2-r impacts the size and morphology of the metal nanostructures obtained upon reduction compared to those formed on other carriers. These epitaxially directed nanostructures suppress the undesired over-hydrogenation of CH3Cl to methane. Kinetic analyses evidence a lower reaction order with respect to H-2 pointing toward mechanistic differences as the origin of the enhanced performance. Finally, the higher stability of the epitaxially directed nanostructures derived from the stronger metal-support interaction is shown to impede sintering, the main deactivation mechanism over standard nanoparticle-based systems; instead, activity losses are linked to increased chlorine uptakes.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100057

In this study, site-specific chemical labeling on Pt stepped surfaces was achieved by attaching the (CO)-C-13 species exclusively on the top side of the (110) steps, while making all of the (111) sites available. The catalysts were then employed in a spectro-electrochemical study of the electro-oxidation of methanol and ethanol. The onset potentials for the formation of (CO2)-C-13 and (CO2)-C-12 revealed the existence of two channels of carbon dioxide formation, separated by about 0.22 V, on the same Pt surface. The active sites with lower overpotential requirement (or lower energy input) for activation of the reaction pathway of CO2 formation resided on the (111) terraces. On the other hand, the active sites with higher overpotential requirement (or higher energy input) for activation of the reaction pathway for electro-oxidation of (COads)-C-13 species to (CO2)-C-13 were at the top of the (110) steps. The findings revealed the identities of the most active sites and least active sites involved in the formation of CO2 during the electro-oxidation of alcohols. On Pt surfaces, the complex interplay involving the steps on the surface favors activation of the pathways for COads oxidation on the (111) terraces, rather than promoting reaction steps directly on the steps themselves.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100058

Doping with guest cations possessing different oxidation states such as Ag can change the chemistry of conventional transition metal oxides and hydroxides, generating unexpected electrocatalytic performances. However, Ag dopants have been found to easily segregate at the surface of electrocatalysts, which induces deactivation. Here, we fabricated Ag-doped CoOOH nanosheet arrays using electrochemical deposition, followed by a simple electrochemical diffusion approach. Surprisingly, we revealed, through atom probe tomography (APT), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) that Ag atoms are homogeneously distributed without any detectable segregation. The Ag-doped CoOOH exhibits enhanced OER performance in terms of overpotential, both experimentally (256 mV) and theoretically (60 mV). The homogeneously distributed Ag dopants facilitate the phase transformation from Co(OH)(2) to the active phase of CoOOH. Calculations show that Ag doping enhances phase stability of CoOOH and exposed Ag dopants act as active sites by releasing -OH adsorbates.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100060

These enzymes catalyze the cofactor-independent acylation of monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG) to diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and phloroglucinol (PG) and have been demonstrated to have a wide substrate scope, making them valuable for potential applications in biocatalysis. Herein, we present a detailed reaction mechanism of PpATase on the basis of quantum chemical calculations, employing a large model of the active site. The proposed mechanism is consistent with available kinetics, mutagenesis, and structural data. The roles of various active site residues are analyzed. Very importantly, the Asp137 residue, located more than 10 angstrom from the substrate, is predicted to be the proton source for the protonation of the substrate in the rate-determining step. This key prediction is corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Based on the current calculations, the regioselectivity of PpATase and its specificity toward non-natural substrates can be rationalized.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100061	31929947

We report here a series of homoleptic Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes and their performances in photochemical water oxidation at pH 1 using persulfate as the sacrificial electron acceptor. These chromophores incorporate CF3 or PO3H2 groups to increase the Ru-III/II standard potentials to 1.3-1.6 V versus NHE, while their homoleptic nature retains photophysical properties (absorption spectra, lifetimes, emission energies, emission quantum yields) comparable to [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+). With [(bda)Ru(isq)(2)] as the catalyst, the chromophores promote visible-light-driven water oxidation with high activity at low pH. The chromophores with phosphonate groups as substituents showed higher activity than expected based on driving force arguments. In addition, kinetic isotope effects as high as similar to 3 were measured, suggesting the involvement of concerted proton-coupled transfer pathways between the catalyst and the chromophores with the phosphonate group acting as the proton acceptor. These chromophores therefore carry out the light absorption, charge migration, and proton transfer roles of P-680, Tyr161, and His190 in Photosystem II on a single molecule and are good candidates for photoelectrochemical water oxidation at low pH in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100063

In this work, we performed extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically study the activity and selectivity of the OCM reactions on several types of the La2O3 and CeO2 catalysts. We theoretically evidenced that the La2O3 catalyst has high hydrocarbon selectivity but low activity, while the CeO2 shows an opposite performance. These results can be largely rationalized by the calculated reaction energetics in generating the key CH3 center dot intermediates and further protecting them from excessive oxidation on the surface. We then proposed two strategies to improve the OCM activity while maintaining the selectivity of the La2O3 catalyst. Geometrically, by constructing the stepped La2O3(210) surface exposing lattice oxygens with low coordination numbers, both the heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in methane and the occurrence of the key CH3 center dot intermediates could be promoted. Electronically, codoping of Sr and Ce into La2O3 could favor the direct formation of CH3 center dot and further avoid its deactivation on the surface, leading to the significantly improved OCM performance. By conducting further analyses on the thermostability of the catalysts and calculating catalytic energetics of the complete reaction cycle, we excluded the practical application of the high-Miner-index La2O3 surfaces, but we theoretically predicted the Sr/Ce-La2O3 catalyst with a proper doping concentration to be highly efficient for catalyzing the OCM reactions.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100064

However, relationships between the catalytic behavior of atomically dispersed metal cations and active sites on metal nanoparticles have been difficult to establish, in large part because of the difficulty in characterizing the local atomic structure of these metal species. Here, we use the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of m-cresol, a model bio-oil compound, to understand relationships between metal structure and reactivity down to the limit of atomically dispersed active sites. Through a combination of kinetic studies, spectroscopic characterization, and density functional theory calculations, we find that isolated Pt cations supported on TiO2 are significantly less active than small Pt clusters for m-cresol HDO due to their lower activity for hydrogen dissociation and their weaker interaction with m-cresol. We demonstrate that m-cresol HDO reaction kinetics are particularly sensitive to the active Pt structure, suggesting that the catalytic reactivity can be a more reliable indicator of catalyst structure than commonly used characterization approaches. These findings provide insights into the ability of isolated Pt cations to catalyze elementary processes critical for hydrogenation catalysis.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100065

Compared to Pt/C, the PtCo/C electrocatalyst possesses higher Pt 5d-orbital vacancy, low level of oxygen species chemisorption on the surface Pt atoms and shorter Pt-Pt bond length (R), and consequently an enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. During the ADT process, a drastic drop in ORR activity after 30 000 ADT cycles can be observed in both the electrocatalysts in spite of their different activity degradation mechanisms. For Pt/C, XAFS results revealed that the oxidation of Pt during the ADT process induced the structure transformation from the partial-coverage surface PtO layer to the full-coverage surface and partial-coverage subsurface PtO layer, resulting in the loss of the Pt active site and consequently the decrease in the ORR activity. For PtCo/C, the oxidation of the Co atom induced the attenuation of strain and ligand effects, and the dissolution and segregation of CoO caused the increase in Pt outer layer thickness during the ADT process, mainly determined the decrease in ORR activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100066

The conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals is vital for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and neutralizing the negative impacts of CO2 emissions on the environment. Various CO2 conversion routes have been proposed on the basis of heterogeneous catalysis. However, the development of a high-performance catalyst with satisfactory activity and selectivity remains challenging. In past decades, the role of ceria in activating CO2 under mild conditions has been widely demonstrated, which has inspired the design of novel heterogeneous catalysts and contributed to the extensive catalytic applications in CO2 conversion reactions. The applications of ceria have been studied in three groups of CO2 conversion reactions, including hydrogenation of CO2, activation of CO2 with alkanes, and nonreductive CO2 transformations. Investigations into these reactions show that CeO2 is a highly tunable material with great potential for CO2 catalysis due to its unique properties such as abundant oxygen vacancy and metal-support interaction. The catalytic performance of CeO2-based catalysts can be improved by various strategies including metal doping, forming mixed oxides or solid solution, as well as morphological control. Future works are proposed to address the challenges in current research and to further advance the CeO2-based catalysts in CO2 conversion reactions.									43	0	0	0	3	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100067

Direct cleavage of the C-C bonds in lignin linkages is significant, but it is challenging to obtain low-molecular-weight aromatic monomers. Herein, using vanadium catalysts under visible light, we selectively cleave the C-C bonds in beta-1 and beta-O-4 interlinkages occluded in lignin models and extracts by an oxidative protocol. Visible light irradiation triggered single electron transfer between the substrate and the catalyst, which further induced the selective C-alpha-C-beta bond cleavage and generated the final aromatic products through radical intermediates. Using this photocatalytic chemistry, the reactivity of lignin models and the selectivity of C-alpha-C-beta bond cleavage were significantly improved. More importantly, this protocol affords aromatic monomers through the fragmentation of organosolv lignins even at room temperature, indicating the potential of photocatalytic C-C bond cleavage of lignin linkages under ambient conditions.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100068

At odds with stereo selectivity, regioselectivity turned out to be only modestly impacted by the chemical structure of the electron donors used as surface modifiers. A clear and simple relationship between regioselectivity and "hydrogen response", and, therefore, polymer molecular weight modulation was highlighted.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100069

Since the MoS2 edge was proposed as a major active site, molecular and polymeric analogues to the MoS2 edge have been widely explored as the HER catalysts. In particular, amorphous MoSx coordination polymers have been considered as active HER catalysts because they are rich in unsaturated Mo-S coordination, which is the characteristic of the active MoS2 edge. Herein, we report that the simple monomeric thiomolybdate (MoS42-) could adopt a polymeric chain structure, which exhibited high HER activity; its turnover frequency surpassed those of dimeric [Mo2S12](2-)- and trimeric [Mo3S13](2-)-derived MoSx catalysts. This high HER activity of monomeric MoS42- is attributed to the polymerization of MoS42- anions, generating active molecular analogues that comprise monomeric S2- sites bridging Mo(V) and Mo(W). Density functional theory calculations of possible polymeric chain structures identified the Mo(IV)Mo(V)(2)(S-2(2-))(2)(S2-)(5) unit as the most plausible structure that best matched the experimentally deduced structure. The Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption on the bridging S2- (p-S2-) site in Mo(IV)Mo(V)(2)(S-2(2-))(2)(S2-)(5) was found to be -0.05 eV, which is close to the thermoneutral state. Combined analyses by resonance Raman spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure suggested the role of Mo-oxo (Mo=O-x) species to generate the active Mo(V)-(mu-S2-)-Mo(IV) center for effective hydrogen adsorption.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100070

All three Cu-based electrodes exhibit high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO2, reduction toward C2H4 production. The CuSn-DAT electrode exhibits the highest FE for CO (similar to 90% at -0.4 V) and C2H4 (similar to 60% at -0.8 V) production and high current density (similar to-225 mA/cm(2) at -0.8 V). In situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) studies in a flow cell obtained from the three Cu-based samples show a correlation between the decreased oxide content on the Cu surface, increased presence of CO, and increased activity for CO and C-2 production. The CuSn-DAT electrode has the lowest amount of Cu2O and exhibits the highest activity, whereas the Cu-DAT electrode has an increasing Cu2O content and exhibits lower activity as the potential is made negative. These results demonstrate that incorporation of different well-mixed alloy materials provides a way to tune CO2, reduction speciation.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100072		
J	Zhang, Minhua; Ren, Jie; Yu, Yingzhe								Insights into the Hydrogen Coverage Effect and the Mechanism of Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins Process on Fe5C2 (510)								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			689	701		10.1021/acscatal.9b03639				JAN 3 2020	2020	Direct production of light olefins from synthesis gas through the Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) process over iron carbide catalysts is promising. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of different hydrocarbons on clean surfaces. However, when these mechanisms were discussed before, the influence of adsorbed surface species, especially surface H, on the mechanisms is less understood. Hence, we reported a density functional theory (DFT) study on the hydrogen coverage effect and the mechanism of the FTO process on Fe5C2 (510). It is found that the Fe5C2 (510) surface may be covered with a layer of H in the FTO process. The mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on the Fe5C2 (510) surface prefers to proceed via the CO insertion mechanism rather than the carbide mechanism in the presence of adsorbed H. The optimized C-C coupling pathways feature H-assisted CO coupling pathways in which the CHCHO pathways (E-a = 1.15 eV) and the CH2CHO pathways (E-a = 1.10 eV) are favorable. The methane formation pathway is an alternative major pathway on the chi-Fe5C2 (510) surface due to its relatively low barrier energies (E-a = 0.80 eV). The formation of oxygenates is unfavorable due to the high C-O dissociation reactivity. The olefin ratio for ethylene and ethane is influenced by two competitive processes in a stepwise hydrogenation. It is suggested from the mechanism that high C-C coupling activity and the matching hydrogenation activity with the former are the key directions to modify iron-based FTO catalysts.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100074

However, the electrochemically active anions in seawater can cause the corrosion of electrodes or undesirable side reactions during the anodic reaction at the anode, thus degrading the overall system efficiency. Hence, it is imperative to develop highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for efficient seawater electrolysis. In this study, carbon-coated sodium cobalt-iron pyrophosphate (Na2Co1-xFexP2O7/C, 0 <= x <= 1) nanoparticles (NCFPO/C NPs) and NCFPO/C NPs loaded on a carbon cloth (NCFPO/C@CC) are fabricated as a promising OER electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater electrolysis. The electrocatalytic OER performance of the NCFPO/C NPs is optimized by controlling their Co/Fe ratio. NCFPO/C@CC acts as an efficient OER electrocatalyst during the OER test in an alkaline saline solution without corroding the electrode and generating reactive chloride species. It also exhibits long-term stability and durability with continuous oxygen generation. In addition, NCFPO/C@CC shows the electrocatalytic OER activity in alkaline seawater, demonstrating that NCFPO/C is a promising candidate as an OER electrocatalyst for realistic alkaline seawater electrolysis.									29	1	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100075

Platinum Catalyzed C-H Activation and the Effect of Metal-Support Interactions								ACS CATALYSIS				10	1			710	720		10.1021/acscatal.9b03807				JAN 3 2020	2020	Catalytic C-H bond activation of methane and ethane on a series of silica supported platinum catalysts (Pt/SiO2) was studied by using hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange. Kinetic experiments demonstrate that under the reaction conditions studied, the rate of C-H bond activation shows approximate first order dependence in alkane and inverse first order dependence in D-2. The rate of C-H activation is affected by the presence of sodium on the silica support, where sodium-free supports have the fastest rates of C-H activation, as assessed by H/D exchange. CO adsorption and FTIR studies indicate that the Pt particles on the sodium-free support are more electron-deficient, having the most blue-shifted linear CO stretch, while sodium-containing supports are more electron-donating, having the most red-shifted linear CO stretch. It is proposed, based on the results described in this article and previous work in the literature, that more electron-donating supports cause the Pt particles to be more electron-rich and to adsorb D* (or H*) more strongly, thereby stabilizing the ground state and resting state of the catalyst, resulting in a decreased rate of C-H activation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100076

Control and understanding of electronic configuration at the active sites are of fundamental importance to achieve this goal. Herein, highly porous Ni1-xCuxO (p-Ni1-xCuxO) nanowire (NW) arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) were synthesized, characterized, and utilized as high-performance catalytic anode for catalyzing the ammonia-borane (AB) electrooxidation reaction (ABOR). This electrocatalyst shows exceptional electrocatalytic properties including an extremely low onset potential (-0.316 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), a high Faradaic efficiency (>98%), and long-term durability toward the ABOR, far outperforming the noble metal-based catalysts. Reaction free energies computed as a function of electrode potential by density-functional theory indicate that doping of Cu for Ni1-xCuxO is favorable for energetically decreasing the energy barriers in the multistep reaction pathways. The modulation of the electronic structure of bimetallic Ni1-xCuxO catalysts underlies the catalytic mechanism by the electronic coupling effect between Ni and Cu.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100077

The reaction represents the third mechanism for ring opening of nonplanar amide bonds discovered. Adding to the facile hydrolytic cleavage of nonplanar N-C(O) amide bonds and sigma N-C bond scission reactions, this reaction manifold engages a peripheral reactivity principle that hinges upon ring strain energy enforced by the twisted amide bond. Considering the wide utility of ring-opening olefin metathesis reactions in various aspects of chemistry, we anticipate that this ring-opening methodology will be of broad interest and could lead to the development of ROM reactions of twisted amides as a powerful synthetic tool.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100079

Herein, we report the bismuth-based catalyst in the efficient electroconversion of CO2 for the formation of formate with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 91% and partial current density of similar to 8 mA cm(-2) at -0.9 V vs RHE. Experimental and theoretical results show that the bismuth-oxygen structure of bismuth oxides is beneficial for a higher adsorption of CO2 and the rate-determining route switching from the initial fast pre-equilibrium of electron transfer process to the subsequent hydrogenation step, accompanied by a lower free energy of intermediate. This work may offer valuable insights into crystal structure engineering to achieve efficient electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction toward generation of valuable products.									74	4	0	0	6	0	76			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100080

In this work, we report a surface active-site engineering approach for modulating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using the macrocycle cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]). A pristine gold surface functionalized with CB[6] nanocavities was studied as a hybrid organic inorganic model system that utilizes host-guest chemistry to influence the heterogeneous electrocatalytic reaction. The combination of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and electrocatalytic experiments in conjunction with theoretical calculations supports capture and reduction of CO2 inside the hydrophobic cavity of CB[6] on the gold surface in aqueous KHCO3 at negative potentials. SEIRA spectroscopic experiments show that the decoration of gold with the supramolecular host CB[6] leads to an increased local CO2 concentration close to the metal interface. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on a CB[6]-coated gold electrode indicates differences in the specific interactions between CO2 reduction intermediates within and outside the CB[6] molecular cavity, illustrated by a decrease in current density from CO generation, but almost invariant H-2 production compared to unfunctionalized gold. The presented methodology and mechanistic insight can guide future design of molecularly engineered catalytic environments through interfacial host-guest chemistry.									19	1	0	0	3	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100081	31929948

Here we show visible-light H-2 production from benzyl alcohol (BAL) with controllable generation of deoxybenzoin (DOB) or benzoin (BZ) through tandem redox reactions. Particularly, DOB synthesis circumvents the use of expensive feedstocks and environmentally unfriendly catalysts that are required previously. Under the irradiation of blue LEDs, the key of steering the major product to DOB rather than BZ is to decrease the conduction band bottom potentials of the ZnIn sulfide catalysts by increasing the Zn/In ratio, which results in the dehydration of intermediate hydrobenzoin (HB) to DOB proceeding in a redox-neutral mechanism and consuming an electronhole pair. As a proof of concept, this method is used to synthesize DOB derivatives in gram scale.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100082

To advance our understanding of the MOR mechanism, we have employed dual thin-layer differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) to study reaction intermediates on a family of Pt-Fe-Cu ternary ordered intermetallics. We found that PtFe0.7Cu0.3/C exhibited the highest CO2 production efficiency, while PtFe0.5Cu0.5/C generated the largest proportion of methyl formate or formic acid. The different selectivity is partially ascribed to the difference in lattice compressive strain due to the incorporation of Fe and Cu atoms. We propose a dual-pathway mechanism in which the increase in lattice contraction can stabilize the intermediates forming methyl formate or formic acid, while a moderate lattice strain leads to the highest CO2 generation via COad intermediates. Our work on ternary catalysts may provide valuable insights for designing electrocatalysts for the MOR.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100083

High temperature favors the highly endothermic process, while catalyst thermal deterioration is a major obstacle. Here we report a robust Ru/MgAl2O4 catalyst prepared via physical vapor deposition method that exhibits 1 or 2 orders of magnitude higher activity than conventional ruthenium or nickel catalysts. Importantly, instead of deactivation or coke deposition, the catalyst demonstrates a surprising activity increase by 1.5 times after reaction at 850 degrees C for 600 h. Ru initially was dispersed as isolated atoms on MgAl2O4, then condensed into unfaceted clusters (1.1 nm), and finally retained as faceted nanoparticles (NPs, 2.7 nm) upon testing, becoming more and more active by decreasing the barrier of breaking the C-H bond of methane. The low Ru content (0.15 wt %) and high space-time yield make it cost-competitive to regeneration-required nickel catalysts, paving a way to develop affordable commercial precious metal catalyst.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100085

The electrode is a key component that controls the efficiency of water splitting. Although noble metals such as Pt, Ru and Ir can achieve high energy efficiencies, their application in water splitting is limited by their high cost. Thus, developing efficient noble-metal-free electrodes is necessary to achieve sustainable hydrogen societies. Here, we report a technique of graphene encapsulation of NiMo alloys for realizing both high catalytic activity and high chemical stability in non-noble metal anodes in transition metal impurities-free aqueous KOH electrolyte. Electrochemical analysis showed that graphene encapsulation significantly enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the NiMo anodes and provided long electrode lifetimes and performances comparable to those of commercially available anodes. Density functional theory calculation revealed that graphene encapsulation significantly reduced the adsorption energy of intermediates onto the NiMo surface, thereby remarkably enhancing the OER activity. The graphene encapsulation method provides a promising electrode design to improve the performance in water splitting electrolyzers.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100086

This transformation proceeds via a proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) activation of an alcohol O-H bond to generate a key alkoxy radical intermediate, which then facilitates the beta-scission of a vicinal C-C bond. Notably, this single-step depolymerization is driven solely by visible-light irradiation, requires no stoichiometric chemical reagents, and produces no stoichiometric waste. This method exhibits good efficiency and excellent selectivity for the activation and fragmentation of the beta-O-4 linkage in the polymer backbone, even in the presence of numerous other PCET-active functional groups. The feasibility of this protocol in enabling the cleavage of the beta-1 linkage in model lignin dimers was also demonstrated. These results provide further evidence that visible-light photocatalysis can serve as a viable method for the direct conversion of lignin biomass into valuable arene feedstocks.									24	0	0	0	4	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100087

Pulsed laser deposition was used to grow (100) IrO2 on a (100) SrTiO3 substrate at deposition temperature ranging from room temperature to 600 degrees C. Detailed structural and morphological characterization was performed using AFM, XRD, and X-ray reciprocal space mapping (RSM) to unravel the geometrical arrangement of [IrO6] octahedra in the (100) IrO2 thin films. It is shown that the symmetry mismatch between the substrate and the epitaxial thin film imposed an orthorhombic distortion of the tetragonal structure of IrO2 and, as a consequence, the [IrO6] geometry is distorted. These data were correlated to the OER characteristics established from electrochemical measurements. DFT modeling was employed to relate differences in surface relaxation of IrO2 films prepared at different temperatures with changes in OER activity. Vacancy formation leads to higher surface stability at temperatures around 500 degrees C, which corresponds to the deposition temperature at which the electrocatalytic activity of (100) epitaxial IrO2 film is maximal.									21	3	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100088

The low dispersion of a Pt particle at the support surface and sintering of Pt nanoparticles under the harsh reaction condition are the main challenges in the practical application of this catalyst. Herein, highly efficient Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts are developed for propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability in this reaction. Full characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H-2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques on these catalysts reveal that the Pt clusters are localized at the Sn single-site in the zeolitic framework, which allows the generated Pt clusters to be homogeneously dispersed at the surface zeolite. The high performance of Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts under a high reaction temperature is mainly due to a strong interaction between the Pt cluster and Sn-zeolite. An initial propane conversion of 50%, high propylene selectivity of above 99%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h(-1) high TOF of 114 s(-1), and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn-2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 degrees C.									41	2	0	0	4	0	42			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100089

The application of the organocatalyst and the hypervalent iodine group transfer reagent allowed for metal-free C-H functionalization and C-C bond formation. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at -40 degrees C and in the presence of an amine base, providing access to an array of heteroaryl-propargyl ketones containing various substituents in good to excellent yields. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by means of both experiments and density functional theory calculations. C-13-labeling and computations determined that the key alkynyl transfer step occurs via an unusual direct substitution at an acetylenic carbon, wherein an iodine-based leaving group is exchanged by a Breslow intermediate nucleophile. Moreover, kinetic studies revealed that the turnover-limiting step of the catalytic cycle is the generation of the Breslow intermediate, whereas the subsequent C-C bond formation is a fast process. These results are fully reproduced and rationalized by the calculated full free energy profile of the reaction, showing that the largest energy span is located between the protonated form of NHC catalyst and the transition state for the carbene attack on the aldehyde substrate.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100091

The production of MA over SSZ-13 after 24 h on stream at 165 degrees C and 1 bar approaches that obtained from mordenite and is significantly higher than from ferrierite at comparable Si/Al of ca. 10. To understand the origin of the activity, SSZ-13 materials are synthesized with variable Si/Al, characterized via several techniques including multinuclear magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, and evaluated for their carbonylation activity. While MA production rates increase with decreasing Si/Al, the correlation is nonlinear due to the effect of Si/Al on the acid site distribution within different confining environments, and the associated impact of the latter on the rate-determining transition state barrier. Enhanced MA production rates trend with acid sites located at the eight-membered ring (8MR) that are increasingly populated as framework Al content increases. Density functional theory analyses of transition state energies as a function of active site location support the experimental findings, where the lowest apparent barriers are associated with the methoxy groups that orient within the plane of the 8MR window. This is due to an optimal charge stabilization of the cationic transition states with the negatively charged oxygens within the 8MR window. The effects of catalyst chemical composition, separate from framework topology, are also investigated using SAPO-34 (the silicoaluminophosphate analog of SSZ-13). Analyses of the H-1 MAS NMR signals and carbonylation activity suggest that the higher acid site strength of SSZ-13 compared to that of the SAPO material is required for effective Bronsted acid catalysis of Koch-type carbonylation pathways.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100092

However, the mechanisms for ORR are generally poorly understood. Here, we report an extensive experimental and first-principles theoretical study of the ORR at nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO). We synthesize three distinct NrGO catalysts and investigate their chemical and structural properties in detail via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and thin-film electrical conductivity. ORR experiments include the pH dependences of 2e(-) versus 4e(-) ORR selectivity, ORR onset potentials, Tafel slopes, and H/D kinetic isotope effects. These experiments show very different ORR behavior for the three catalysts, in terms of both selectivity and the underlying mechanism, which proceeds either via coupled proton-electron transfers (CPETs) or non-CPETs. Reasonable structural models developed from density functional theory rationalize this behavior. The key determinant between CPET vs non-CPET mechanisms is the electron density at the Fermi level under operating ORR conditions. Regardless of the reaction mechanism or electrolyte pH, however, we identify the ORR active sites as sp(2) carbons that are located next to oxide regions. This assignment highlights the importance of oxygen functional groups, while details of (modest) N-doping may still affect the overall catalytic activity, and likely also the selectivity, by modifying the general chemical environment around the active site.									45	2	0	0	2	1	46			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100093

Taking the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) mutant EbSDR8-G94A/S153L (Mu0) with poor activity toward bulky aryl ketones as an example, H145 and Y188 were identified as the engineering targets due to the distinct conformation difference in the two simulation modes. To break the "beam" structure formed by these residues at the entry of cavity C2 in free-state simulation, the substrate-binding pocket was reconstructed, and meanwhile the relative size of cavities C1 and C2 was modulated to improve the enantioselectivity. In this way, mutants for efficient asymmetric reduction of o-halogenated acetophenones, propiophenones, aromatic ketoesters, and diaryl ketones were designed, delivering chiral alcohols with >99% conversion and >98% ee. The effectiveness of this design strategy was also validated by the successful redesign of PpYSDR, generating a variant for efficient reduction of (4-chlorophenyl) 2-pyridyl ketone into the S-product with >99% conversion and 96% ee. MD simulations suggested a suitable binding pocket with proper energy contribution as the ubiquitous mechanism for the improvement of activity and enantioselectivity toward substrates with varied structures. The success in this study provides hints for the rational design of alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases with both a broad substrate spectrum and high enantioselectivity.									19	0	0	0	7	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100094

On the Fe/C-terminated Fe3C(010) surface, C-O dissociation of CO and CHxC (x = 1, 2, and 3) with higher barriers is not accessible, while consecutive hydrogenation of adsorbed CO to methanol and surface carbon atom to methane is accessible with low overall barriers and exothermic reaction energies. However, the formed CH3 from surface carbon hydrogenation can couple with adsorbed CO to form surface acetyl (CH3CO), resulting in the formation of the initial C-C bond with comparably low overall barrier and exothermic reaction energy. The formed acetyl can be deoxygenated to surface CH3C, which can couple with surface carbon to form CH3CC. The formation of CH3CO and CH3CC reveals that chain growth on the Fe/C-terminated Fe3C(010)-0.25 surface progresses alternatingly via both carbide and CO insertion mechanisms. The formed surface CH3CC can be hydrogenated into CH3CH2CH2 for next C-C coupling with CO, and this closes the initial chain growth cycle. The larger difference in the adsorption energy of CO and H-2 or the H-2/CO ratio will determine hydrogenation and C-C coupling. On the Fe-terminated Fe3C(010)-0.00 surface, however, CO prefers direct and H-assisted dissociation to C and CH at the B5 site; these two paths have close high overall barriers, and the formed carbon prefers to be hydrogenated into CH2, which can couple with CH to form CH2CH with low overall barrier and exothermic reaction energy, and only the carbide mechanism is operating for chain propagation. Comparison with the Fe/C- and Fe-terminated Fe5C2(100) surfaces as well as metallic Fe surfaces has been made.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100095

Intermolecular amination of C(sp(3))-H bonds by catalytiC-Nitrene transfer is a promising method for forging C-N bonds. An organocatalytic approach to nitrene transfer by way of an iminium salt offers a site-selective method for C(sp(3))-H amination. Understanding of this amination mechanism including the nature of the relevant intermediates and the factors controlling the mechanism of the N-H bond formation step would aid in the design of catalysts and C(sp(3))-H amination methods. In this work, the mechanism of the iminium salt-catalyzed C(sp(3))-H amination via nitrene transfer was elucidated computationally using quantum mechanical methods and molecular dynamics simulations. Dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations provide support for an open singlet biradical species in equilibrium with the lower energy triplet species. Calculations further reveal that, while the singlet biradical species undergoes N-H bond formation by a hydride transfer process, the triplet species forms the N-H bond by H-atom abstraction. Molecular dynamics simulations rule out the possibility of a fast rebound of the carbon substrate following N-H bond formation. A predictive model for mode of activation and site selectivity that is consistent with experimental observations is presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100097	34113476

To address this challenge, the atomically dispersed Pt is anchored on two Mo-based supports with similar morphology and particle size, that is, face-centered cubic-structured alpha-MoC and MoN. Spectroscopic and computational investigations demonstrate that the Pt atoms are coordinated with N atoms in Pt/MoN but with Mo atoms in Pt/alpha-MoC, leading to an entirely different catalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Pt mass activity for Pt/MoN reaches 0.71 A/mg(Pt), at 0.9 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], which is 15 times higher Pt mass activity than that of Pt/alpha-MoC. Density functional theory calculations correlate the better ORR performance of Pt/MoN with the weaker adsorption of OH* because of the modulation of electronic properties of Pt by the coordination with N atoms. This study highlights the importance of controlling the coordination environment of metal atoms in heterogeneous (electro)catalysis and suggests that tuning the coordination environment could be an effective strategy in catalyst development.									42	1	0	0	0	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100098

Measured oxidation potentials and computed nucleophilicity parameters support a mechanism of nucleophilic attack of one partner onto the oxidized neutral radical form of the other partner. Our understanding of this model permitted the development of cross-coupling reactions between nucleophilic phenols/arenes and easily oxidized phenols with high selectivity and efficiency. A highlight of this method is that one equivalent of each coupling partner is utilized. Building on these findings, a nonenzymatic, catalytic method for coupling tyrosine was also developed.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500022	33927912

The binding situation in the corresponding cationic complexes Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CHCMe2Ph)(NHC)(OC(CF3)(3))(+) B(Ar-F)(4) - (NHC = IMes (1), IMesCl(2) (2), IMesMe(2) (3), and IMesH(2) (4) was compared to that of the analogous neutral Schrock catalyst Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CHCMe2Ph)((OC(CF3)(3)))(2) (5). Single-crystal X-ray data were used as a starting point for the optimization of the geometries of the catalysts at the PBE0-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory; the obtained data were compared to those obtained from X-ray absorption (XAS) and emission spectroscopy (XES). The very similar X-ray spectroscopic signatures of the XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) and K beta-XES of catalysts 1, 2, and 5 suggest that a similar oxidation state and charge are present at the Mo center in all three cases. However, charge delocalization is more pronounced in 1 and 2 compared to 5. This is supported by quantum chemical (QC) calculations, which reveal that all NHCs compensate to a very similar extent for the cationic charge at molybdenum, leading to charge model 5 (CM5) partial charges at Mo between +1.292 and +1.298. Accordingly, the partial charge in the NHCs was in the range of +0.486 to +0.515. This strong delocalization of the positive charge in cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene NHC (nonafluoro-tert-butoxide) complexes is also illustrated by the finding that the analogous neutral Schrock catalyst 5 has a more positive charge at molybdenum (+1.435) despite being a neutral 14-electron complex. Complementarily, charge analysis on complexes 1 and 2 and the acetonitrile-containing derivatives 1 center dot MeCN and 2 center dot MeCN revealed that a small partial positive charge of about +0.1 was found on acetonitrile, accompanied by an increase in positive charge on Mo. Accordingly, the partial charges at the imido, the alkoxide, and NHC ligands decreased slightly. Finally, the catalytic activity of complexes 1-4 was determined for a number of purely hydrocarbon-based substrates in a set of olefin metathesis reactions. A correlation of the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) with catalyst activity, expressed as the turnover frequency after 3 min, TOF3min, was found for complexes 1-3 based on imidazol-2-ylidenes. Fe-57-Mossbauer measurements on Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH-ferrocenyl)(NHC)(OTf)(2) and Mo(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH-ferrocenyl)(NHC)(OTf)(+) B(Ar-F)(4)(-) (NHC = IMes (6, 8) and IMesH(2) (7, 9)) revealed significant changes in the quadrupole splitting of these complexes. These suggest a significantly more efficient charge distribution between the cationic molybdenum center and an imidazol-2-ylidene-based NHC compared to the same catalysts containing the IMesH(2) ligand.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500038

Herein, we report the design and applications of a discrete very small bite-angle bisphosphine ligand, namely, FMPhos. Featuring a fluorene-methylene unit appended on the single-carbon linker, the ligand harbors an unusually rigid backbone that presumably stabilizes its complexation with transition metals during catalysis. Compared with the known dppm ligand, it exhibited superior reactivity and regioselectivity in a number of alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, catalyzed by iridium and rhodium.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500002

Mechanistic investigations reveal that the redox-neutral reaction undergoes an intercepted radical pathway to cleave the C-sp2-C-sp3 bond, followed by the combination with copper-catalyzed arylation reaction in the presence of aryl boronic acid to construct a new C-sp2-C-sp3 bond.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500059

Iron-molybdenum sulfide materials were obtained through three distinct scalable synthetic approaches using microwave irradiation or heat treatment in furnace under inert and reductive atmospheres. These electrocatalysts were combined with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and their activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was studied in acidic environment. The most efficient composite material of the series was obtained by microwave synthesis and displays a current density per geometric area of 10 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 140 mV with unity faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution. This composite cathode catalyst was implemented into a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer single cell with iridium black as the anode catalyst and could be operated at 0.5 A.cm(-2), requiring less than 300 mV additional voltage compared to Pt and with remarkable stability during accelerated stress testing.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500001

Heme proteins are potential enzymes for DNA cleavage. Using a small heme protein, myoglobin (Mb), as a model protein, we engineered a metal-binding motif of [1-His-1-Glu] (native His64 and mutated Glu29) in the heme distal site. The single mutant of L29E Mb was capable of not only efficient DNA cleavage but also DNA degradation upon Mg2+ binding to the heme distal site, as shown by an X-ray crystal structure of the Mg2+-L29E Mb complex. Molecular docking of the protein-DNA complex revealed multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions at their interfaces, involving both minor and major grooves of DNA. Moreover, both the distal Arg45 and the ligand Glu29 were identified as critical residues for the nuclease activity. This study reports the structure of a water-bridged heterodinuclear center of Mg-heme (Mg2+-H2O-Fe3+), showing a similar function as the homodinuclear center (MgA(2+)-H2O-MgB2+) in natural nuclease, which indicates that the Mg2+-L29E Mb complex is an effective artificial nuclease.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500003

Although heterogeneous catalysts, including metal-loaded and intermetallic catalysts, afford simple reaction conditions and catalyst reusability, it is challenging to achieve high catalytic activity, durability, and Pd-atom economy together in a single catalyst. Herein, we report the successful preparation of Pd-ZrC, a Pd-based catalyst with the described desirable features. In it, a-few-nanometer-sized nanoparticles of intermetallic ZrPd3 are uniformly dispersed on the surface of nanoporous ZrC with a surface area of 340-450 m(2) g(-1). As a result of the presence of electron-rich Pd sites and the material's strong electron-donating ability, Pd-ZrC achieved high catalytic performance in Suzuki cross-coupling reactions at room temperature. Because a low Pd content (1 wt %) is sufficient to produce highly catalytically active Pd-ZrC, this material represents a great improvement in terms of Pd-atom economy over previously reported catalysts. Moreover, no catalytic degradation was noted over up to the presented 15 reaction cycles as the active Pd sites were stabilized in the ZrPd3 lattice. These results indicate that Pd-ZrC has the advantages of both metal-loaded and intermetallic catalysts, providing an approach to enhance the degree of freedom for designing heterogeneous catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500004

The engineered enzyme directly utilizes inexpensive H2O2 to oxidatively decarboxylate C6-C18 saturated fatty acids as well as plant oil-derived unsaturated fatty acids, displaying high reactivity (e.g., 3,700 h(-1) of turnover frequency for myristic acid). With in situ H2O2 supplied by glucose oxidase, this enzyme delivers 1-alkenes in a more productive and scalable fashion (up to 99% yield).

However, the efficiency of pristine C3N4 photocatalysts is still limited by the narrow light absorption range and rapid charge recombination. Here, we presented a facile approach to simultaneously enhance the light absorption and promote the charge separation by introducing alkali metal dopants and N vacancies on C3N4. The introduction of alkali metal dopants and N vacancies successfully broadened the light absorption range, reduced the band gap from 2.85 to 2.63 eV, and greatly inhibited the charge recombination. The synergistic effect of doping and defect resulted in the improvement of photocatalytic performance with a H2O2 production rate of 10.2 mmol/h/g, which is 89.5 times that of pristine C3N4. Thus, this work not only gives insights into the synergistic effect of doping and defect for simultaneously manipulating the light absorption and charge separation processes but also inspires further work to develop more efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production.									25	0	0	0	4	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500006

A ruthenium precatalyst, [Ru (p-cymene)Cl](2)Cl-2 (1), is employed, and the reactions proceed under neat conditions at 135 degrees C and atmospheric pressure (ca. 1.5 bar at 135 degrees C). Unsymmetrical dibenzyl ethers undergo selective hydroboronolysis on relatively electron-poor C-O bonds. In arylbenzyl or alkylbenzyl ethers, C-O bond cleavage occurs selectively on C-Bn-OR bonds (Bn = benzyl); in alkylmethyl ethers, selective deconstruction of C-Me-OR bonds leads to the formation of alkylboronate esters and methane. Cyclic ethers are also amenable to catalytic hydroboronolysis. Mechanistic studies indicated the immediate in situ formation of a mono-hydridobridged dinuclear ruthenium complex [{(eta(6)-p-cymene)RuCl}(2)(mu-H-mu-Cl)] (2), which is highly active for hydroboronolysis of ethers. Over time, the dinuclear species decompose to produce ruthenium nanoparticles that are also active for this transformation. Using this catalytic system, hydroboronolysis could be applied effectively to a very large scope of ethers, demonstrating its great potential to cleave C-O bonds in ethers as an alternative to traditional hydrogenolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500007

Ce doping on the A site of SrFeO3 increased the structural stability in a reducing atmosphere, but ceria was found to exsolve from the perovskite during the cooling process in the air if the doping level reached 20 atom %. The additional doping of 5 atom % Ru in Sr0.8Ce0.2FeO3 on the Fe site could prevent the ceria segregation in air and induce the surface decomposition under fuel conditions for the formation of nanoscale SrO, CeO2, and Ru-0. The SSOFC with Ce/Ru codoped SrFeO3 on a Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 electrolyte showed a small R-p value (0.12 Omega cm(2)) when H-2 and ambient air were used as fuel and oxidant, respectively. The peak power densities of 846 and 310 mW cm(-2) were achieved at 800 degrees C using H-2 and C3H8 as fuel, respectively. The excellent coke resistance of the anode could be related to the simultaneous in situ exsolution of CeO2, SrO, and Ru-0 nanoparticles.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500008

We proposed a coordination structure of the Ni center in the precatalyst based on elemental analysis and Ni K-edge XANES, and we confirmed that it is consistent with Ni K-edge EXAFS. The Suzuki-Miyaura-type coupling of aryl halides and arylboronic esters proceeded using P4VP-NiCl2 (0.1 mol % Ni) to give the corresponding biaryl compounds in up to 94% yield. Surprisingly, when the same reaction of aryl halides and arylboronic acid/ester was carried out in the presence of amides, the amidation proceeded predominantly to give the corresponding arylamides in up to 99% yield. In contrast, the reaction of aryl halides and amides in the absence of arylboronic acid/ester did not proceed. P4VP-NiCl2 successfully catalyzed the lactamization for preparing phenanthridinone. P4VP-NiCl2 was reused five times without significant loss of catalytic activity. Pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biologically active compounds were synthesized efficiently using P4VP-NiCl2 catalysis. Nickel contamination in the prepared pharmaceutical compounds was not detected by ICP-MS analysis. The reaction was scaled to multigrams without any loss of chemical yield. Mechanistic studies for both Suzuki-Miyaura and amidation were performed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500009

It is well-known that the structures of metal catalysts determine their properties. However, recent studies suggested that the structures of metal catalysts change dynamically under reaction conditions, resulting in the deactivation or activation of metal catalysts. This Review summarizes the latest research progresses in the structural reconstruction of metal catalysts via controlled-atmosphere transmission electron microscopy. The state-of-the-art research technologies and crucial factors affecting the nanosized metal catalyst reconstruction are discussed. Various types of reconstruction phenomena are reviewed, including sintering and dispersion, reshaping, composition evolution, surface reconstruction of metal oxides, and strong metal-support interactions. Moreover, recent studies of the structure-property relationship of metal catalysts are also reviewed. Finally, we highlight current challenges and provide the perspectives for future research of this topic.

In an effort to capitalize on recent progress in the development of functional enzyme mimics for the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds, we developed cross-linked microgels with embedded binuclear copper(II) complexes that are shown here to hydrolyze 1.4 over 1.6 glycosidic bonds under mildly alkaline conditions at elevated temperatures. The microgel catalysts show an unusual preference for the hydrolysis of 1 -> 4 beta- over 1 -> 4 alpha-glycosidic bonds yielding up to 25 mu g L-1 of glucose from cellobiose over 72 h and about half of that during the hydrolysis of maltose after correction for background effects. The experimental results are supported by computational analyses of the interactions between the embedded catalyst and the nonactivated disaccharide in putative transition state structures of the assembly during hydrolysis of the nonactivated glycosidic bond to rationalize this observation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500011

This is often approached through the development of dynamic catalyst (or initiator) systems that use external stimuli to elicit discrete, site-specific transformations that impact the polymerization. Herein we highlight developments in polymerizations that are modulated by external stimuli, with particular focus on those systems that enable notable changes in kinetics, monomer selectivity, polymer architecture, or tacticity. Examples of external stimuli include chemical oxidants or reductants, light, applied voltage, and mechanical force.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500012

Alkali metals as promoters are generally crucial for Cu-Fe-based catalysts, but their critical role in higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) is still far from clear. Here, we report the regulating effect of a potassium (K) promoter from a reactant activation perspective on Cu-Fe-based catalysts for HAS from CO2 hydrogenation using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and chemisorption methods. The optimized catalyst denoted as 4.6K-CMZF with a moderate K content exhibits the highest HA space time yield (STY) in a fixed-bed reactor. It is found that the K can promote reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and tailor the ratio of nondissociated CO to dissociated CO by strengthening linear CO adsorption and weakening bridging CO adsorption. A proper amount of K can balance the nondissociated and dissociated activation of CO, thus providing an adequate *CHx and *CO species to take part in *CHx-*CO coupling reaction. The K promoter can also suppress H-2 activation, thereby inhibiting alkylation reaction. The promoting effect of K can be attributed to the balance of surface *CHx, *CO, and *H species by regulating CO activation and H-2 activation, thus favoring HA synthesis via *CHx-*CO coupling and hydrogenation reactions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500013

A major issue, however, is the stability of these materials in acidic environments and at potentials experienced in situ in PEFC cathodes and rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments. Density functional theory (DFT)-based approaches have been valuable to understand how atomic scale structures couple to ORR activity. Little has been reported, however, on quantification of active site structure stability. This work proposes a set of DFT-accessible descriptors for M dissolution (demetalation) that directly address this need. Through the application of this approach to a specific Fe-N-4 bilayer graphene-hosted active site structure, the roles of the environment (pH and potential), ORR intermediates, and graphene underlayers are explored. Ranges of stability are reported and hypotheses explaining previously reported experimental behavior based on these findings are proposed. In particular, proposed are model implications for experimental trends in stability with respect to alkaline and acidic conditions; experimental trends for dissolution to occur below a given potential; and observed discrepancies in stability for materials in O-2-bearing vs O-2-purged environments. Based on these findings, suggestions for improving active site resistance to metal dissolution are provided.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500014

To allow the knowledge-driven development of improved catalysts, it is necessary to deeply understand the fundamental aspects of the FAOR, which can be ideally achieved by investigating highly active model catalysts. Here, we studied SnO2-decorated Pd nanocubes (NCs) exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance for formic acid oxidation in acidic medium with a SnO2 promotion that boosts the catalytic activity by a factor of 5.8, compared to pure Pd NCs, exhibiting values of 2.46 A mg(-1) Pd for SnO2@Pd NCs versus 0.42 A mg(-1) Pd for the Pd NCs and a 100 mV lower peak potential. By using ex situ, quasi in situ, and operando spectroscopic and microscopic methods (namely, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy), we identified that the initially well-defined SnO2-decorated Pd nanocubes maintain their structure and composition throughout FAOR. In situ Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy revealed a weaker CO adsorption site in the case of the SnO2-decorated Pd NCs, compared to the monometallic Pd NCs, enabling a bifunctional reaction mechanism. Therein, SnO2 provides oxygen species to the Pd surface at low overpotentials, promoting the oxidation of the poisoning CO intermediate and, thus, improving the catalytic performance of Pd. Our SnOx-decorated Pd nanocubes allowed deeper insight into the mechanism of FAOR and hold promise for possible applications in direct formic acid fuel cells.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500015	33362944

The catalytic activity for aromatic C-H borylation was significantly affected by (i) the linker length of the Ir-bipyridine complex, (ii) the coimmobilized organic functionality, and (iii) the substituents on the aromatic substrate compounds. The fine-tuned supported catalyst showed higher activity than the homogeneous Ir-bipyridine complex when using a specific substrate such as benzonitrile. We elucidated this property by conducting solid-state NMR, FT-IR, XAFS, and in situ FT-IR analysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500016

Herein, we reported a metal-free CeO2 nanorods (rCeO(2)) catalyst for gas-phase transformation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol with the highest selectivity of 93.2% at 323 K. Compared to CeO2 nanocubes and nanopolydra, r-CeO2 shows a much higher crotyl alcohol production rate, comparable turnover frequency to those of noble-metalbased catalysts, and very high crotyl alcohol selectivity. This can be associated with a relatively high density of surface oxygen vacancies on rCeO(2), which constructs the solid frustrated Lewis pair sites with enhanced heterolytic H-2 dissociation and preferred crotonaldehyde adsorption via the C=O bond. However, a further reduction of r-CeO2 by H-2 was observed to be unfavorable with regard to both catalytic activity and selectivity, because of the emergence of crotonaldehyde adsorption via the C=C bond. These findings provide a potential approach to fabricate high-performance and low-cost catalysts for selective hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols using bare CeO2 with a rigid surface structure design.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500017

The intrinsically highly active Pt/Pd/C catalyst with an ORR mass activity of ca. 1000 A g(-1)-Pt at 0.9 V versus RHE was synthesized by a direct displacement reaction method, and the activity was activated to ca. 1500 A g(-1)-Pt via a high activation protocol (HAP) (a rectangular potential cycling of 0.05-1.0 V vs an RHE conducted in 0.1 mol dm(-3) HClO4 under an Ar atmosphere at 80 degrees C). The ORR activities of the Pt/Pd/C catalysts were further increased by surface decoration with melamine or tBuTAP, and the mass activity of ORR of the catalyst activated by an HAP was enhanced to 3625 A g(-1)-Pt at 0.9 V versus RHE via the melamine decoration, which is about 11-fold that of a reference Pt/C catalyst (320 A g(-1)-Pt). Cyclic voltammograms, linear sweep voltammograms, and CO stripping voltammograms indicated that the surface decoration further destabilized the OH species (OHad) adsorbed on the Pt shell and suppressed the formation of oxide on the Pt shell, which could explain the extraordinary enhancement of ORR activity. We present guidelines for creating Pt-based catalysts with extraordinarily high activity for the ORR by the synergistic combination of the intrinsically active Pt-based catalyst [improvement from the inside of Pt nanoparticles (NPs)] and surface decoration (improvement from the outside of Pt NPs).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500018

A supported nickel-based catalyst is the most promising candidate for the CO2 methanation reaction. Additionally, understanding the role of the support is essential for the rational design of nickel-based CO2 methanation catalysts. Herein, we elaborated on the effect of the support on the catalyst structure, CO2 adsorption, CO2 activation, methanation mechanism, and deactivation process. Future directions are suggested to elucidate the fundamental aspects of this catalytic system, including the formation mechanism of preferentially exposed facets, the nature of strong metal-support interactions, the balance between support reducibility and basicity, and the CO2 methanation pathways over nickel-based catalysts with various supports.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500019

The efficient electrosynthesis of NH3 is challenging because of the lower activation of N-2 and higher activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we propose theory-guided activity descriptors to identify an efficient N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) catalyst, followed by its implementation in a flow-through gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to quantify the effects of pH, cation identity, H2O saturation, and N-2 concentration on the kinetics of the NRR. The identified Cu catalyst with dominant (111) facets electrodeposited on a carbon paper provides optimal active sites to obtain maximum NH3 faradaic efficiency (FE) of 18 +/- 3% at-0.3 V vs RHE and the maximum NH3 current density of 0.25 +/- 0.03 mA cm(-2) (0.86 nmol.cm(-2).s(-1)) at-0.5 V vs RHE in alkaline medium. The electrolyte pH mostly affects the HER by pH-induced binding of *H and reorganization of H2O, which favor the NRR at an optimal pH of 13.5. Increasing the size of monovalent cations stabilizes NRR intermediates and increases the NH3 current density from Li+ to K+. However, increasing the size of the cation from K+ to Rb+ reduces the FE of NRR, which is due to a direct reduction of H2O in the solvation shell of larger cations to produce H-2. Another strategy to improve NH3 FE is to reduce the H2O saturation on the catalyst, which can be achieved by sparging the reactant gas directly through the GDE. Increasing the N-2(g) flow rate not only increases the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient but also reduces the H2O saturation in the pores of the GDE, which primarily suppresses the HER. The fixed potential DFT calculations reveal an associative distal mechanism for the NRR over Cu(111), where the hydrogenation of *N-2 is the rate-limiting step. This finding also corroborates with the measured reaction order with respect to N-2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500020

However, the powder form of nanocarbons limits their industrial applications because of the large pressure drop in a fixed-bed reactor and the big difficulties in handling loose powder in a fluidized-bed reactor. To address these issues, herein, we report a general poly(imidazolium-methylene)-assisted grinding strategy for synthesizing mechanically robust nanocarbon-embedded network monoliths by grinding a mixture composed of nanocarbons and the as-formed poly(imidazolium-methylene) chloride (PImM) with a subsequent pyrolysis process. The as-prepared nanocarbon-based network monoliths feature nanocarbons to be well-dispersed within a N-doped carbon (NC) network. The monolith is adequately hard and high density and can be cracked and sieved into granule nanocarbon catalysts. Taking nanodiamonds (NDs) as an example, in the grinding procedure, PImM can penetrate into ND aggregates to disperse NDs and can adhere the deagglomerated NDs because there is a strong interaction between NDs and PImM through strong cation-p interactions, pi-pi interactions, and electrostatic interactions since many nanocarbons including NDs have negative charges on their surface. The designed PImM plays three roles in the preparation of ND-embedded network monolith including the adhering agent, isolating agent, and a precursor of the NC network. The resulting granule ND@NC carbocatalyst from its corresponding ND@NC network monolith shows 6.39 mmol g(-1) h(-1) of steady-state styrene rate (9.26 and 2.24 times higher compared to that of NC and ND, respectively) with 99.0% of styrene selectivity for ethylbenzene direct dehydrogenation (EDH) to styrene, a commercially important reaction. The granule ND@NC carbocatalyst also shows high catalytic stability for EDH reaction. The strategy has been extended to carbon nanofiber-embedded monoliths. This work not only creates a granule carbocatalyst for styrene production via EDH reaction but also paves an avenue to overcome the bottleneck problems regarding the applications of the powders of diverse nanocarbons in heterogeneous catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500021

CeO2 support was superior to other conventional supports in view of the activity of supported iron catalysts. The effect of iron loading amount on CeO2 supports showed a linear relationship with an iron loading amount up to 3 wt %, which corresponded to "monolayer" coverage, and then it was almost constant with a further increase of the iron content. The Fe/CeO2 catalyst with 3 wt % iron loading (Fe(3)/CeO2) had higher stability than the catalysts with higher iron loadings. The optimal Fe(3)/CeO2 catalyst showed a 56% phenol yield and an 87% sum yield of phenol and methylated phenols at 673 K under guaiacol/N-2/H-2 = 1/45/135 flow with W/F = 1.0 g.h.mol(total)(-1). The X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DRUV-vis), Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterizations confirmed that the FeOx species were finely dispersed on the Fe/CeO2 catalyst with <= 3 wt % iron, and higher iron loadings led to formation of Fe2O3 particles in calcined catalysts. Although other supported iron catalysts with 3 wt % iron loading also contained dispersed FeOx species, the reducibility of Fe/CeO2 was higher than that of other supported iron catalysts, which might be related to the higher activity. The XAS characterization of spent catalysts showed that the stable Fe(3)/CeO2 catalyst contained only Fe3+ and Fe2+ species during the reaction, while in the Fe(10)/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of iron proceeded to a greater extent and Fe3C crystals grew during the reaction. The structure of this monolayer Fe(3)/CeO2 was further characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Rather than a two-dimensional Fe oxide sheet, a structure composed of dispersed Fe4O6 clusters is suggested for monolayer coverage. The coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS) in the interface between FeOx and reducible CeO2 is suggested to be the active site.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500023

In this work, two Ir0.5Ni0.5Ox mixed oxide catalysts with layered and solid solution morphologies were prepared by modifying a facile hydrothermal methodology. The catalytic OER activity and stability of the Ir-Ni catalyst with a homogeneous distribution (IrNi-HD) was seriously compromised compared to pure IrOx due to the high concentration of surface nickel prone to corrosion under reaction conditions. However, the design of layered IrOx-Ni(OH)(x) (IrNi-LY) with Ir at the exposed surface allowed a 50% reduction in the molar concentration of the precious metal on the electrode compared to IrOx without impairing the catalytic activity or stability. As a result, IrNi-LY outperformed IrOx in activity when normalized to the Ir mass.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500024

One of the reasons for the low OER performance is related to the existence of different types of surface states at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface: recombining surface states (r-SS) and surface states due to intermediate species (i-SS). Since the impact of surface states on OER is still under debate, we investigate how different types of surface states affect PEC water oxidation and how they impact experimental measurements. In a new computational approach, we combine a microkinetic model of the OER on the semiconductor surface with the charge carrier dynamics within the semiconductor. The impact of r-SS and i-SS on the current-voltage curves, hole flux, surface state capacitance, Mott-Schottky plots, and chopped light measurements is systematically investigated. It is found that (a) r-SS results in a capacitance peak below the OER onset potential, while i-SS results in a capacitance peak around the onset potential; (b) r-SS leads to an increase in the OER onset potential and a decrease in the saturation current density; (c) r-SS leads to Fermi-level pinning before the onset potential, while i-SS does not result in Fermi-level pinning; and (d) a smaller capacitance peak of i-SS can be an indication of the lower catalytic performance of the semiconductor surface. Our approach in combination with experimental comparison allows distinguishing the impact of r-SS and i-SS in PEC experiments.

The present study concerns the effect of Co and Ni substituents in the ferrite (Fe3O4) structure used as a catalyst precursor for medium-temperature Fischer-Tropsch (MTFT) synthesis, in anticipation of enhanced oxygenate selectivities. The ferrites were synthesized by co-precipitation and characterized in detail before and after exposure to MTFT conditions, employing both conventional ex situ and state of the art in situ techniques. The complex product spectrum from the MTFT was analyzed by combining off-line one-dimensional and on-line two-dimensional gas chromatography. The latter was used specifically to investigate the formation of minority species, such as oxygenates, which are often disregarded in literature. In situ XRD and magnetometry showed no notable change in the reduction behavior of the ferrites with a cobalt substituent, but substituting with Ni decreased the reduction temperature drastically from 315 to 250 degrees C, most likely due to the increased hydrogen dissociation activity of Ni. The activity, CO conversion, in MTFT increased in the order Fe << CoFe < NiFe < CoNiFe. Incorporation of Co and Ni in the catalysts makes them less prone to deposition of inactive carbon. The addition of Ni specifically, also results in a significant shift in selectivity toward a shorter average chain length, lower olefinicity and higher water-gas shift activity. Interestingly, these shifts are paralleled by a 76% or 170% increase in C2+ oxygenates selectivity or yield, respectively. The increase in hydrogenation activity of substituted (i.e., Co and/or Ni) Fe-based catalysts, plays a critical role in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis activity and selectivity to the different product classes (i.e., paraffins, olefins, and oxygenates) and the findings reported here provide valuable insights of key importance for further development and optimization of FT catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500026

Here, the pure TiO2 nanoparticles, obtained through in situ reduction, exhibit excellent catalytic PDH performance. At 600 degrees C, the initial propane conversion could reach 67%, and the one-pass yield of propylene was 45%. The propane conversion was 21% at 550 degrees C, and propene selectivity could reach as high as 94%. According to ex/in situ characterization results and Quantum chemical calculations, the dynamic formation and reaction mechanism of active sites were detailedly investigated. The reductive propane and its derivatives can react with surface lattice oxygen of nanosized anatase TiO2 to form oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti cations (Ti-cus), which can catalyze PDH with high propene selectivity; the rate of C3H6 formation is in line with the surface oxygen vacancy concentration. Notably, the Ostwald ripening of nanosized TiO2 with high surface energy is crucial to the formation of oxygen vacancies. The agglomeration of nanosized TiO2 at high temperature makes the lattice oxygen atoms mobile and active, which are consumed abruptly and then form oxygen vacancies and Ti-cus more easily. It is denoted as "mutation reduction". The surface oxygen vacancy concentration is also influenced by the oxygen migration rate from bulk to surface driven by thermal energy and potential energy (the differences of concentration).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500027

However, their catalytic performance highly depends on supports, and the real evolution of Cu species is still covered by active components. Herein, we supply a Cu/SiO2 catalyst prepared by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), showing catalytic performance comparable to that of the active Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for methanol synthesis from CO2. It reaches 79% selectivity at a CO2 conversion of 5.2%, which is an outstanding selectivity among previously reported Cu/SiO2 catalysts, considering they are generally treated as nearly inert catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis shows that 5 times more Cu+ species in the FSP-Cu/SiO2 are stabilized in comparison to those in the traditional ammonia evaporation (AE) made catalyst even after reduction at 350 degrees C. A unique shattuckite-like precursor with a slightly distorted Cu-O-Si texture structure formed in the FSP-made catalyst is responsible for the enriched Cu+ species. Variations of intermediate formation and methanol production are found to have a good relationship with the amount of Cu+ species. According to the results of high-pressure in situ DRIFTS, we attribute this to the promotional effect of Cu+ on the stabilization of CO* intermediates, which inhibits CO desorption and facilitates further hydrogenation to CH3OH via the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathway. These results bring insights into the Cu reduction behavior and the function of Cu+ species during methanol production on Cu-based catalysts without the assistance of active supports.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500028

However, it is challenging to enhance the HMF yield due to side reactions. In this study, a systematic approach combining theory and experiment was performed to investigate the influence of Lewis acids and organic solvents on the HMF yield. For the Lewis acid effect, a relationship between chemical hardness and experimental HMF yields was found in the rate-limiting step of glucose-to-fructose isomerization for six metal chlorides; HMF production was promoted when the metal chloride and a substrate had a similar chemical hardness. To study the organic solvent effect, a multivariate model was developed based on the insights gained from the mechanistic study of fructose dehydration, to predict HMF yields in a given water-organic cosolvent system. It showed a reliable accuracy in evaluating HMF yields with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.0% with respect to experimental HMF yields for 13 solvents, and also predicted HMF yields with a MAE of 10.7% for four new solvents. Chemical interpretation of the model revealed that it is desirable to use a solvent capable of stabilizing the carbocation intermediates with low proton transfer activity and high hydrogen bond basicity, to maximize the HMF yield. This multivariate model informs experimentalists about rational selection of solvents with very low computational costs needed to calculate only six variables for each solvent. It can be expanded to other catalytic systems such as heterogeneous Bronsted-Lewis bifunctional catalysts and enables optimization of reaction conditions to obtain other useful platform molecules through biomass conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500029

The hypothesis here is that the metal ions in metal oxide clusters on a Co(0001) support enhance the adsorption of CO and weaken the C-O bond strength, which can then facilitate the dissociation of the CO reactant. To test this hypothesis, we developed three computational models of Ti4O8/Co(0001), Zr4O8/Co(0001), and (Mn8O8Co)-Co-/(0001). We quantify the CO adsorption behavior at the interface sites between an oxide cluster and a Co(0001) support as well as the corresponding IR spectra. We correlate the computed CO stretch frequencies with their CO adsorption energies, as well as the CO stretch frequency with the C-O bond length, and relate these findings to the changes in the chemical bonding in the bound CO. The interface is the most favorable site for CO adsorption. Adsorption results in an increase of the C-O bond length and a decrease in its vibrational frequency. From a chemical bonding analysis, the bond order in CO at this site drops from 3 (in the gas phase) to 1. This decrease in bond order is a necessary precursor stage for CO dissociation. The experimental measurements of the corresponding Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra support this point. The favorability of CO adsorption at the interface sites is due to an electron transfer from the metal ion in the metal oxide cluster to the O atom in CO. We establish a linear relationship between the C-O bond length and CO frequency, and this relationship is found to be independent of the support, type of metal oxide cluster, or the adsorption site.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500030		
J	Kopac, Drejc; Jurkovic, Damjan Lasic; Likozar, Blaz; Hus, Matej								First-Principles-Based Multiscale Modelling of Nonoxidative Butane Dehydrogenation on Cr2O3(0001)								ACS CATALYSIS				10	24			14732	14746		10.1021/acscatal.0c03197				DEC 18 2020	2020	Propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10) are short straight-chain alkane molecules that are difficult to convert catalytically. Analogous to propane, butane can be dehydrogenated to butenes (also known as butylenes) or butadiene, which are used industrially as raw materials when synthesizing various chemicals (plastics, rubbers, etc.). In this study, we present results of detailed first-principles-based multiscale modelling of butane dehydrogenation, consisting of three size- and time-scales. The reaction is modelled over Cr2O3(0001) chromium oxide, which is commonly used in the industrial setting. A complete 108-step reaction pathway of butane (C4H10) dehydrogenation was studied, yielding 1-butene (CH2CHCH2CH3) and 2-butene (CH3CHCHCH3), 1-butyne (CHCCH2CH3) and 2-butyne (CH3CCCH3), butadiene (CH2CHCHCH2), butenyne (CH2CHCCH), and ultimately butadiyne (CHCCCH). We include cracking and coking reactions (yielding C-1, C-2, and C-3 hydrocarbons) in the model to provide a thorough description of catalyst deactivation as a function of the temperature and time. Density functional theory calculations with the Hubbard U model were used to study the reaction on the atomistic scale, resulting in the complete energetics and first-principles kinetic parameters for the dehydrogenation reaction. They were cast in a kinetic model using mean-field microkinetics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The former was used to obtain gas equilibrium conditions in the steady-state regime, which were fed in the latter to provide accurate surface kinetics. A full reactor simulation was used to account for the macroscopic properties of the catalytic particles: their loading, specific surface area, and density and reactor parameters: size, design, and feed gas flow. With this approach, we obtained first-principles estimates of the catalytic conversion, selectivity to products, and time dependence of the catalyst activity, which can be paralleled to experimental data. We show that 2-butene is the most abundant product of dehydrogenation, with selectivity above 90% and turn-over frequency above 10(-3) s(-1) at T = 900 K. Butane conversion is below 5% at such low temperature, but rises above 40% at T > 1100 K. Activity starts to drop after similar to 6 h because of surface poisoning with carbon. We conclude that the dehydrogenation of butane is a viable alternative to conventional olefin production processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500031	33362945

This longstanding puzzle exposes gaps in the fundamental understanding of electrocatalysis by showing that singular adsorption descriptors (e.g., the hydrogen binding energy) cannot describe kinetic effects across electrolytes. In this Perspective, we discuss the strengths and shortcomings of binding energies as HER/HOR activity descriptors across different electrolytes and catalyst surfaces, with a special emphasis on the bifunctional mechanism, and identify several "beyond adsorption" descriptors for chemical dynamics in the double layer, including the potential of zero (free/total) charge, the binding energy of coadsorbed spectator species, transition state barrier heights, and the solvation strength of electrolyte cations. Recent evidence for and against the importance of these phenomena is assessed in the context of hydrogen electrocatalysis to determine their feasibility to accurately predict catalyst behavior. Finally, we propose paths forward for improving the mechanistic understanding of how specific interactions between the surface and species in solution affect macroscopic rates, which include combining single-crystal voltammetry, electroanalytical chemistry, in-operando spectroscopy, atomic-scale DFT calculations, and molecular "double-layer dopants".									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500032

Plasma activation can potentially circumvent the limitations of conventional thermocatalytic ammonia synthesis; however, the contribution of different reaction mechanisms to the production of ammonia at the catalyst surface remains unclear. Here, we identify the reaction intermediates adsorbed on gamma-Al2O3-supported Ni and Fe catalysts during plasma-activated ammonia synthesis under various temperatures and reactor configurations using FTIR spectroscopy, steady-state flow reactor experiments, and computational kinetic modeling. Ammonia yield can be influenced by plasma-derived intermediates and their interactions with catalyst surfaces, which lead to different reaction pathways: Ni/gamma-Al2O3 enhances plasma-promoted NH3 production and favors surface-adsorbed NHx species, while Fe/gamma-Al2O3 shows the presence of N2Hy and a lower overall concentration of N-containing adsorbates. Plasma-catalyst interactions are probed to reveal that elevated temperature and plasma irradiation of the surfaces promote NH3 desorption. The direct evidence of catalytic surface reactions occurring during a plasma-activated process provides mechanistic insight into plasma-activated ammonia synthesis.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500033

The pK(a) of the amido ligand moiety in this catalytic system is highly sensitive to the species adsorbed on the metal center, resulting in a substantial variation in the ligand pK(a) along the catalytic cycle. Since the ligand pK(a) is an important characteristic that determines the exact role of the ligand during aqueous methanol dehydrogenation, it has important implications for metal-ligand cooperative pathways.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500034

In situ NMR at 50 degrees C is used to track the selective transformation of methane to CH3OSO3H and CH3SO3H at high conversions. Integrating a set of kinetic and computational studies, the mechanism of methane monofunctionalization by Pd-2(III) is examined. Experimental rate laws and common kinetic isotope effects for CH3OSO3H and CH3SO3H formation suggest that both transformations proceed via a common rate-limiting C-H activation step. Introduction of O-2 or Pd-2(II,III) suppresses CH3SO3H generation, indicating a radical chain sequence. Although the metal-metal bonded Pd-2(III) complex is a net two-electron oxidant, our aggregate kinetic data point to a mechanistic model that features rate-limiting H atom abstraction by the Pd-2(III) complex to generate a methyl radical intermediate. The CH3 center dot intermediate then recombines with Pd-2(II,III) to furnish a CH3Pd2III intermediate that reductively eliminates CH3OSO3H. Alternatively, the CH3 center dot intermediate can enter a chain reaction with SO3 to generate CH3SO3H. DFT computations support the radical-based C-H activation by Pd-2(III) and delineate H atom abstraction pathways with computed reaction barriers and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) that are consistent with experimental data. These mechanistic investigations challenge the paradigm of electrophilic C-H activation and highlight H atom abstraction as a potent pathway for selective methane C-H oxidative functionalization at high reaction rates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500035

In this work, a lead-halide perovskite ( MAPbBr(3), MA = methylammonium) is utilized as a photocatalyst for selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) using atmospheric O-2 upon visible-light irradiation. Under minimally optimized conditions, the photocatalytic conversion of HMF in acetonitrile solvent reaches 100% with a DFF selectivity of over 90%, achieving an overall furanic carbon yield of over 96%. A detailed catalytic mechanism was proposed based on various spectroscopic and experimental results, revealing that the atmospheric O-2, photogenerated electrons (e(-)), holes (h(+)), O-center dot(2)-, and O-1(2) species together play crucial roles in the effective and selective photo-oxidation of HMF to DFF. In addition, our present photocatalytic system is also applicable for photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol with approximately 100% conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity, providing insights for future exploration of the present catalytic system.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500036

However, understanding the interplay between the molecular processes and the local catalyst properties at the scale of individual particles requires the correlation of information obtained from different microscopy techniques. In this contribution, we directly reveal the nontrivial nanoscale correlation between the acid site distribution and the local catalytic performance of dealuminated mordenite zeolite particles by sequentially applying advanced Raman microspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. In addition to the intra- and interparticle heterogeneities, the nonstraightforward correlation between acidity and activity at the pixel-to-pixel level highlights the complex impact of postsynthetic treatments on zeolites.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500037

The activity of 1 and product yields outperform the currently available non-transition-metal catalysts used for this catalysis. Mechanistic studies show that the silicon(II) center in complex 1 catalyzes the C-N bond formation via a different pathway in comparison with non-transition-metal catalysts.

We use this Au+TiO2 series to correlate mechanisms that influence catalytic activity including hot electron injection and production, electron-hole pair formation, oxygen vacancy content, and electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) stemming from photoinduced charge transfer from TiO2 to Au. The Au weight loading varies from 1 and 8 wt %, and Au NPs are either entrained within the oxide network of the aerogel during sol-gel synthesis (Au-IN-TiO2) or deposited on as-formed TiO2 aerogel (Au-ON/TiO2). Electron tomography reveals that Au-IN-TiO2 exhibits greater metal parallel to metal-oxide intimacy than Au-ON/TiO2 at the same weight loading, while increasing Au content (especially with Au-ON/TiO2) yields broader size distributions, larger Au NPs, and lower Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy. Comparing broadband photoactivity to dark activity reveals that high Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy and monodisperse small (similar to 5 nm) Au NPs diminishes catalytic activity under broadband illumination, while Au+TiO2 composites with high weight loading, some large (>50 nm) Au NPs, and decreased Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy enhance activity under broadband illumination.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500040

After analyzing the distribution of 35 structural and dynamic observables, we uncovered that increased enzyme surface hydration of substituted sites is the predominant factor to drive the improved resistance in OS. The iterative recombination of four surface substitutions revealed that the extent of hydration in BSLA variants correlates strongly with its OS resistance (R-2 = 0.91). Remarkably, the substitutions recombination led to a highly resistant BSLA variant (I12R/M137H/N166E) with a 7.8-fold improved resistance in 12% (v/v) TFE, while retaining comparable catalytic activity (similar to 92%) compared to the wild-type enzyme. Our findings prove that strengthening protein surface hydration via surface charge engineering is an effective and efficient rational strategy for tailoring enzyme stability in OSs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500041

Nevertheless, manganese oxides suffer from low reusability while carbon materials face the problem of limited catalytic efficiency. For the purpose of making full use of the advantages of the two materials as well as avoiding their shortcomings, carbon-coated Mn3O4 composites (Mn3O4/C) with a regular nanocube structure were designed to activate PS for the removal of organics, and the catalytic processes were deeply investigated. The catalyst prepared at 400 degrees C with a precursor ratio (glucose/KMnO4) of 0.5 exhibited the best catalytic performance along with satisfactory reusability owing to the protection of the outer carbon layer. According to experimental results and density functional theory calculation, there were van der Waals interaction and a part of the strong attraction between the interface of PS and Mn3O4/C, which could be enhanced by inner Mn3O4 and thus promoted the electron transfer between PS and carbon shell, and the defective edges of the carbon layer with hydroxyl (C-OH) groups could act as active sites for PS activation. Radical (SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot) and nonradical (O-1(2)) oxidation processes both participated in the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol, in which (OH)-O-center dot was dominating. This study not only proposed a promising catalyst for the degradation of pollutants but also expanded research ideas for future PS activation mechanism studies by integrating the experiment and simulation.									11	0	0	0	6	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500042

In-situ spectroscopy is employed to determine the trend of interfacial CO2 concentration with different alkali metal cations. Contradictory to the cation buffering hypothesis, the interfacial CO2 concentration decreases with increasing size of alkali metal cations at CO2RR conditions on Au. The interfacial CO2 concentration is largely dependent on the rate of CO2 depletion by reduction or reaction with OH- generated at the electrode, and not on the proposed buffering effect.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500043

Here, we evaluate the ceria catalyst for CO oxidation as a model reaction to rationally design an ultrastable catalyst with high activity. The goal was achieved by co-doping with rare-earth (RE) and transition metals (TM) simultaneously. The RE dopant stabilized the catalyst by inhibiting sintering that could lead to catalyst deactivation. The TM dopant increased the activity by facilitating formation of surface defects. Consequently, ceria co-doped with RE (=La, Sm) and TM (=Cu) had increased catalytic activity as well as superior resistance to deactivation during 10 cycle measurement (1 cycle: 900 degrees C, 24 h -> cooling at room temperature -> target degrees C, 24 h) of similar to 700 h, which is harsher than any other reported conditions. This approach will shed light on the design of ultrastable oxide materials for a wide range of catalytic reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500044

Using a microkinetic analysis in combination with results from density functional theory calculations, we show that although propane dehydrogenation (PDH) occurs by two successive dehydrogenation steps on terraces, an unexpected non-reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism accounts for more than half the propylene production at the under-coordinated active sites that dominate the kinetics of PDH. The main reaction is composed of three dehydrogenation steps that have two beta-H atoms and one alpha-H atom removed from propane, followed by the hydrogenation of CH3CCH2; starting from this species, the formation of propylene and byproducts proceed by way of two parallel competing reactions. The proposed mechanism has been verified by exploring several key and general aspects of the kinetic behavior observed in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and it is found that only when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are taken into consideration can the experimentally determined kinetics be properly reproduced. Increasing the H-2 partial pressure from low values favors an increase in the coverage of free sites due to the gasification of adsorbed coke precursors, which in turn gives rise to lowered energy barriers for C-H bond breaking, thereby achieving an increased propane consumption rate. As the H-2/C3H8 ratio increases, the rate of propylene production first goes up and then declines, and a maximum is observed at a H-2/C3H8 ratio of 1.33, which occurs when the negative effect of the increased free 4-fold hollow sites that bring about deep dehydrogenation begins to dominate the positive effect of the increased free step sites that are responsible for activating propane. The mechanism formulated here proves to be valid even if the temperature, pressure, or the H-2/C3H8 ratio is varied and hence provides a foundation for the rational design of metal and alloy catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500045

Herein, the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) is systematically studied on the NiCu alloy-loaded carbon nitride nanosheets (NixCuy/CNS). The TOF of AB hydrolysis for NiCu/CNS catalyst under visible light irradiation was nearly 3.5 times higher than that in the dark. Photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that the improved photocatalytic activities originate from a combination of alloying effect, Mott-Schottky junction at the metal-semiconductor interface as well as the localized surface plasmon resonance induced under the visible light irradiation, which synergistically increase the local electron density at the active Ni sites. More importantly, the infrared spectra and isotope labeling-mass spectrometry methods were used to establish the source of hydrogen and unravel the reaction mechanism. It is suggested that the cleavages of B-H and O-H bonds are the initial steps of AB hydrolysis, which lead to the formation of intermediates M-H- (metal and electronegative H- from -BH3) and M-H+ (metal and electropositive H+ from H2O), respectively. The H-2 molecule could form through three main paths as (1) two H atoms from -BH3, (2) two H atoms from H2O, and (3) one H atom from -BH3 and another from H2O. Results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations are consistent with the formation of electron-rich Ni sites in the NiCu, and the activation of H2O is a rate-limiting step (RLS). Redistribution of electrons in NiCu significantly enhances the adsorption of AB, the activation of H2O molecules, and the associative desorption of H adatoms as well, which effectively promote the cleavage of B-H and O-H bonds and release of H-2. This work gives a systematic mechanistic study on photocatalytic AB hydrolysis involving multichannel electron-transfer pathways, which will provide a powerful guidance for the rational design of active catalysts for AB hydrolysis through multipronged effects.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500046

Here, Co nanoparticles were utilized for the electrochemical activation of CO2 hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure conditions. A range of transient kinetic experiments in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and imaging techniques were employed to correlate the observed catalytic activity with the electronic and morphological characteristics of the cobalt catalyst surface. Our results show that migrating ions from the solid electrolyte to the catalyst surface has a dual effect, which has an impact on the observed catalytic behavior. First, they lead to an electrochemically formed double layer on the catalyst surface, which effectively modifies the catalyst work function and consequently alters the observed catalytic rate. Second, they have a profound effect on the oxidation state of cobalt and therefore on the structure of the cobalt oxide particles formed. The presence of Co oxide phases upon anodic polarization shows up to a 5-fold increase in the catalytic rate of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The enhancement of the catalytic activity observed in this work, with a relatively inexpensive cobalt oxide film, is comparable to that obtained with noble metal catalysts in classical EPOC studies. The present study also demonstrates that the formation of different oxide phases can be controlled accurately by electrochemical means and used to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity of cobalt. The reported results could guide the design and operation of more selective and active catalytic processes for the RWGS reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500047

However, most electrocatalysts are confronted with the predicament of a low yield rate for ammonia production. In this study, we report the chlorine-doped reduced graphene oxide that can efficiently electroreduce nitrogen to ammonia. At an applied potential of -0.3 V (vs RHE), the chlorine-doped reduced graphene oxide attains a high NH3 yield of 70.9 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) (2.84 mu g h(-1) cm(-2)) with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 5.97%, which shows a considerable ammonia yield in terms of the metal-free carbonaceous material electrocatalysts. Experimental results indicate that the chlorine doping can be propitious to remarkably strengthen the nitrogen adsorption in the defect structure. Density functional theory calculations verify this result and further reveal that the adsorbed nitrogen is reduced through the associative distal pathway. These results come down to the appropriate electronegativity of chlorine, which can induce the electron redistribution of the adjacent carbon atoms, favoring the electroreduction of N-2. Our work expands a new member for the application of nonmetallic carbonaceous materials in nitrogen electroreduction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500048

Reconstruction of the enzymatic active sites in the artificial systems, to produce active and robust biocatalysts, has been a significant but challenging subject. Biomolecular self-assembly, typically with de novo designed peptide or DNA as the building blocks, provides an effective avenue to orient and confine reactive groups into a catalytically active configuration to mimic and even rival the catalytic performance of native enzymes. In this Review, we discuss the chemical and structural properties of DNA and peptide selfassemblies, and principles and strategies of designing active sites that show hydrolase-, peroxidase-, oxidase-, or aldolase-like activities. We focus on the relationship between and control over the structures of the artificial active sites and catalytic performances. We also highlight the synergies between the components in the formation of the active sites, as well as the applications of the artificial enzymes. In the end, we provide an outlook on the obstacles, possible solutions, and future directions, in the aspect of structural modeling, improving catalytic performances, and upgrading complexity of the active sites.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500050

In contrast to traditional zirconia-based heterogeneous catalysts, the community has assumed that Zr-MOFs are inert catalyst supports that do not participate directly in hydrocarbon transformations, such as olefin hydrogenation and isomerization. Here, we report that the Zr-MOF NU-1000 is capable of catalyzing olefin hydrogenation and isomerization, without any postsynthetic modifications, under a hydrogen atmosphere. We probe H-2 activation over the nodes of NU-1000 via spectroscopic and computational techniques revealing that H-2 dissociation can occur heterolytically across coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites and proximal hydroxide and mu(3)-oxo ligands. These results, along with catalytic experiments, suggest that H-2 activation results in node-supported zirconium hydrides capable of the hydrogenation and isomerization of 1-butene. When examining rate dependence on the partial pressure of H-2, we observe first-order dependence for hydrogenation and half-order dependence for isomerization. Half-order H-2 rate dependence is consistent with a mechanism where both fragments of cleaved H-2 are active for 1-butene isomerization, suggesting that heterolytic cleavage generates acidic protons resulting in parallel, acid-, and hydride-catalyzed isomerization pathways. This work shows that Zr-MOFs have more diverse reactivity than the current literature may suggest and opens possibilities for ways in which Zr-MOFs can be used as heterogeneous catalysts and supports.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500051

Use in the Catalytic Desymmetrization of 3,3-Disubstituted Oxetanes								ACS CATALYSIS				10	24			14971	14983		10.1021/acscatal.0c04497				DEC 18 2020	2020	A family of C-2-symmetrical 1,1'-spirobiindane-7,7'-diol (SPINOL) derivatives containing polymerizable styryl units has been prepared through a highly convergent approach. Radical copolymerization of these monomers with styrene has allowed the synthesis of a family of immobilized SPINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acids (SPAs) where the combination of the restricted axial flexibility of the SPINOL units and the existence of extended and adaptable chiral walls adjacent to them leads to enhanced stereocontrol in catalytic processes. The optimal immobilized species (Cat f) brings about the catalytic desymmetrization of 3,3-disubstituted oxetanes in up to 90% yield with up to >99% enantioselectivity, exhibiting a very high recyclability (no decrease in conversion or enantioselectivity after 16, 16-h runs). To exploit these characteristics, a continuous flow process has been implemented and operated for the sequential preparation of 17 diverse enantioenriched products. The suitability of the flow setup for gram scale preparations (20 mmol scale), the stability of Cat f for long periods of time with intermittent use in flow, and its deactivation/reactivation by treatment with pyridine/hydrochloric acid in dioxane have been demonstrated. Density functional theory has been employed to provide a rational justification of the deep effect on enantioselectivity arising from the presence of sterically bulky substituents at the 6,6'-positions of the SPINOL unit. The main structural features of Cat f have subsequently been incorporated to the design of a simplified homogeneous analog available in a straightforward manner (Cat g) that performs the benchmark desymmetrization reaction with similar yields and enantioselectivities as Cat f, providing a convenient alternative for cases when single use in solution is sought.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500052

Catalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals has been put forward as a viable strategy. While thermocatalytic routes of producing CO, methanol, methane, and higher hydrocarbons from CO2 have been the focus of considerable research efforts, photocatalytic conversion is an emerging approach. Photoactivation of CO2 has potential as a greener process because it could be carried out at lower temperatures and pressures, decreasing the energy consumption. The recent advent of available computational power and tools has made it possible to study the reaction in silico for catalyst prediction and mechanism elucidation. In this Review, we thus focus on ab initio research of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and comparison with experiments. The most commonly used materials are variously doped TiO2, g-C3N4, and perovskites, which have favorable optical properties on their own. Their efficiency is mostly governed by the band gap, charge separation, and charge transfer. Their characteristics can be improved, and the catalysts can be tailored for a specific use by doping, introduction of defects (such as oxygen vacancies or geometric effects), cocatalysts, or using Z-scheme catalysts. Most theoretical studies focus on the calculations of conduction and valence bands, band gap, and adsorption energies. Some studies try to describe the reaction mechanism. Few studies go beyond the hybrid-functional DFT approach and try to explicitly model the effect of electron excitation. While a theoretical description of the excited states is possible with post-DFT methods, it has yet to be applied to the problem of CO2 photoreduction on a larger scale. We conclude the Review with an outlook on how the current state-of-the-art can be used for improving the existing catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500053

Broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance were observed under the reaction conditions. Computational studies suggest that ligands containing phenyl substituents provide greater activity through more favorable aniline binding in the catalytic cycle in comparison to alkyl-substituted phosphorinanes. A general and high-yielding procedure for the synthesis of biaryl phosphorinanes by phospha-Michael addition of primary biarylphosphines to 1,4-dien-3-ones in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), under relatively mild conditions (23-110 degrees C), is also described. HFIP as the solvent significantly accelerates the phospha-Michael addition, allowing the preparation of previously inaccessible ligands and higher yields overall.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500054

Despite its application in asymmetric reduction, which prompted several engineering attempts of this enzyme, the order of chemical events in the active site, their contributions to limit the reaction rate, and interactions between the enzyme and non-native 3-oxocarboxylates have not been explored. Here, a combination of kinetic isotope effects, protein crystallography, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations were employed to dissect the HBDH mechanism. Initial velocity patterns and primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects establish a steady-state ordered kinetic mechanism for acetoacetate reduction by a psychrophilic and a mesophilic HBDH, where hydride transfer is not rate limiting. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on the reduction of 3-oxovalerate indicate that hydride transfer becomes more rate limiting with this non-native substrate. Solvent and multiple deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggest hydride and proton transfers occur in the same transition state. Crystal structures were solved for both enzymes complexed to NAD(+):acetoacetate and NAD+:3-oxovalerate, illustrating the structural basis for the stereochemistry of the 3-hydroxycarboxylate products. QM/MM calculations using the crystal structures as a starting point predicted a higher activation energy for 3-oxovalerate reduction catalyzed by the mesophilic HBDH, in agreement with the higher reaction rate observed experimentally for the psychrophilic orthologue. Both transition states show concerted, albeit not synchronous, proton and hydride transfers to 3-oxovalerate. Setting the MM partial charges to zero results in identical reaction activation energies with both orthologues, suggesting the difference in activation energy between the reactions catalyzed by cold- and warm-adapted HBDHs arises from differential electrostatic stabilization of the transition state. Mutagenesis and phylogenetic analysis reveal the catalytic importance of His150 and Asn145 in the respective orthologues.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500055	33391858

Bioinspired complexes that form high-valent metal-oxo intermediates capable of hydrogen abstraction and rebound hydroxylation are promising candidates. This promise has made them a target for computational high-throughput screening, typically simplified through the use of linear free energy relationships (LFERs). However, their mid-row transition-metal centers have numerous accessible spin and oxidation states that increase the combinatorial scale of design efforts. Here, we carry out a computational design screen of over 2500 mid-row 3d transition-metal complexes with four metals in numerous spin and oxidation states. We demonstrate the importance of spin/oxidation state in dictating design principles, limiting the generalization of strategies derived for widely studied high-spin Fe(II) catalysts to other metals or spin/oxidation states. Combined assessment of the effect of ligand-field tuning on reaction step energetics and on the identity of the ground state allows us to propose refined design strategies for spin-allowed methane-to-methanol catalysis. We observe weak coupling of energetics and design principles between reaction steps (e.g., oxo formation vs methanol release), meaning that LFERs do not generalize across our larger catalyst set. To rationalize relative reactivity in known catalysts, we instead compute independent reaction energies and propose strategies for further improvements in catalyst design.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500056

Specifically, in the presence of C2H2/C2H4/H-2 reaction mixtures, a permeable amorphous hydrocarbon overlayer is formed with simultaneous insertion of carbon atoms into the Pd lattice that drives the formation of low-coordinated Pd-carbide, thus providing more reactive Pd-C-sub@C-layer sites (C-sub: subsurface carbon; C-layer: carbon layer on the surface). The combination of these surface and subsurface effects hinders Pd-hydride, weakens ethylene adsorption confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, and thus improves catalytic behavior for selective hydrogenation of acetylene (93% ethylene selectivity at 100% conversion) with long-term stability. In the absence of hydrogen, a denser more crystalline overlayer is formed with severely restricted permeability, resulting in significantly lower activity. Moreover, by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), it is demonstrated that different active sites dominate this catalytic reaction depending on the choice of adsorbate and exposure temperature. This work represents an alternative and arguably a simpler manner to design more reactive catalytic sites with the characteristics of long-term stability and facile preparation, which would enable promising industrial applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500057

Here, a 5-methylidene-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-one- dependent aminomutase from Taxus canadensis (TcPAM) was repurposed to transfer the amino group irreversibly from ( 2S)-styryl-alpha-alanine to exogenously supplied trans-3-phenylglycidate enantiomers, producing anti-phenylserines stereoselectively. TcPAM catalysis inverted the intrinsic regioselective chemistry from amination at C-beta to C-alpha of enantioenriched trans-3-phenylglycidates to make phenylserine predominantly (97%) over phenylisoserine (similar to 3% relative abundance). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the chiral auxiliary derivatives of the biocatalyzed products confirmed that the amine transfer was stereoselective for each glycidate enantiomer. TcPAM converted (2S,3R)-3-phenylglycidate to (2S)-anti-phenylserine predominantly (89%) and (2R,3S)-3-phenylglycidate to (2R)-anti-phenylserine (88%) over their antipodes, with inversion of the configuration at C-alpha in each case. Both glycidate enantiomers formed a small amount (similar to 10%) of syn-phenylserine by retaining the configuration at C-alpha. The minor syn-isomer likely came from a beta-hydroxy oxiranone intermediate formed by intramolecular ring opening of the oxirane ring by the carboxylate before amine transfer. TcPAM had a slight preference toward (2S,3R)-3-phenylglycidate, which was turned over (k(cat) = 0.3 min(-1)) 1.5 times faster than the (2R,3S)-glycidate (k(cat) = 0.2 min(-1)). The catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)(app)/K-M(app) approximate to 20 M(-1)s(-1)) of TcPAM for the antipodes were similar. The kinetic data supported a two-substrate ping-pong mechanism for the amination of the phenylglycidates, with competitive inhibition at higher glycidate substrate concentrations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500060

Combining nonprecious cocatalysts with semiconductors is vital for optimizing these processes. Herein, a step-by-step route is reported for the in situ growth of island-shaped graphene on TaON particles (TaON@G) with controllable distribution, targeting a superior photocatalyst for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction. The TaON@G photocatalyst possesses the snug contact interface with suitable interfacial energy levels for accelerating the charge separation, the island-shaped graphene with a hollow nanoarchitecture for facilitating the adsorption of CO2, and the hierarchical structure with spatially separated active sites for activating CO2 and promoting proton release. The optimized TaON@G achieves a visible-light-driven CO2-to-CH4 yield of 1.61 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is nearly 13-fold higher compared with that of pristine TaON and outperforms most Ta-based (oxy)nitride catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further elucidate the enhanced activity, suggesting that TaON interacts with graphene strongly with the charge transfer from TaON to graphene, inducing electron-rich graphene with a significant upshift of the graphene Fermi level, leading to a high filling fraction of the antibonding orbitals, thereby weakening the C=O bond of the adsorbed CO2 for breaking. Our study highlights the importance of rational design of well-defined hierarchical photocatalysis to synergistically integrate the structural and functional advantages for maximizing catalytic performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500061

Iron complexes of thio-imino-quinoline (TIQ) ligands, upon activation by modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), were found to catalyze the oligomerization of alpha,omega-dienes (1,7-octadiene, 1,8-nonadiene, and 1,9-decadiene) and the copolymerization of such dienes with ethylene. The reactions furnish highly linear structures with internal double bonds, indicating the incorporation of both vinyl groups of alpha,omega-dienes into the polymer chain in a linear insertion fashion. Iron complexes with large substituents (e.g., iPr, Cy) on the S atom and small substituents (e.g., Et, Me) at the ortho positions of the N-aryl ring in the TIQ ligand afforded superior catalytic activity, high linear selectivity, and high alpha alpha,omega-diene content in the ethylene-alpha,omega-diene copolymers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the diene enchainment involves 2,1-insertion of the first vinyl group into a Fe-C bond and beta-H elimination, followed by 1,2-insertion of the second vinyl group into a Fe-H bond. The linear enchainment can be attributed to the low activation barriers for the beta-H elimination and subsequent 1,2-insertion. The formation of internal double bonds in the ethylene-alpha,omega-diene copolymer chain allows for facile postpolymerization functionalization, which was demonstrated by olefin hydrosilylation to access Si-functionalized materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500062

Such developments often require catalysts with particular morphologies because many chemical reactions are sensitive to the catalyst structure. However, it can be challenging to synthesize and stabilize shape-controlled catalysts. It would therefore be desirable to tailor the morphology of an existing electrocatalyst to exhibit favorable catalytic properties. In this work, such morphological alteration is explored using cathodic corrosion: an electrochemical etching process that can generate geometrical shapes on metallic surfaces. Specifically, cathodic corrosion is utilized to tailor a well-defined Pt(111) electrode for oxygen reduction and glycerol oxidation catalysis. Both the oxygen reduction activity and the glycerol oxidation selectivity can be tailored by controlling the cathodic corrosion conditions. These results demonstrate the specific potential of cathodic corrosion for tailoring catalyst activity and selectivity.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500063

Nickel sulfides offer significant potential as electrocatalysts for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, the active phase governing the electrochemical conversion is still under debate. We show that mesoporous thin-film NiS2 synthesized by a novel soft-templating method without post-sulfurization exhibits superior HER activity in alkaline media after a preconditioning step that results in sulfur leaching, amorphization of the surface, and collapse of the mesoporous structure. A comparative analysis with crystalline NiS2 reveals that partial hydroxylation of the under-coordinated Ni sites is responsible for the superior HER activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500064

Since biocatalysis has become crucial for chemical synthesis, we mainly focus on Reetz's contributions in this area. Some personal reflections from some of his former co-workers are also included, which reveal the stimulating atmosphere in the Reetz group in terms of science, career advice, and the importance of ethical considerations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500065

Here, we report that the Li additive restructures MgO to enhance the surface density of the fourfold-coordinated Mg2+ site (Mg-4c(2+)) of MgO{110} facets, eventually leading to Li-MgO catalysts exclusively exposing the Mg-4c(2+) site. Such Li-MgO catalysts were observed to efficiently catalyze the OCM reaction by activating methane into a methyl radical intermediate with minimized further dissociations and consequent combustion reactions. These results demonstrate the presence of efficient single-site catalysis involving Mg-4c(2+) of MgO{110} facets in Li-MgO catalysts with high Li contents for the OCM reaction, which might provide some insights in developing industrially viable OCM catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500067

Silicotungstic acid (SiW) is found to be the most active and selective among other HPA. At low SiW loadings, catalysts have low selectivity due to the formation of a butanal by-product, while at high loadings (>= 40 wt %), selective butadiene formation and stable performance are achieved. Strong Bronsted acid sites associated with intrinsic SiW protons are shown to be more active in butadiene synthesis as compared with Si-OH2+ sites formed by the interaction of HPA protons with a silica support. The kinetic study and product cofeeding experiments suggest that propene activation or C-C bond formation is the rate-determining step and that both butadiene and butanal are formed over strong acid sites starting from a common intermediate. Over weaker acid sites, condensation of butanal with formaldehyde leads to 2-ethylacrolein. Besides that, the reaction is complicated by butadiene interaction with formaldehyde leading to 2,3-dihydropyran, propene oligomerization and cracking, formaldehyde decomposition toward CO and H-2, and extensive coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation. However, the optimization of reaction temperature, SiW loadings, and the content of water in reaction media allows us to achieve a butadiene selectivity up to 64% and stable catalyst performance with time on stream.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500068

In this work, we conducted a combined theoretical and experimental approach to contribute to this discussion. For such, detailed electronic structure density functional theory calculations (aiming at probing density of states, infrared spectra, geometric parameters, charge densities, and reaction energetics) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy experiments were carried out revealing the relevance of an appropriate combination of reactive surface sites to support the formation of several intermediates that are formed in the C-C coupling over MgO. The roles of Mg and O sites were also studied under an electronic perspective and different geometrical arrangements. We found that a kink configuration was the most adequate for ethanol to 1-butanol upgrading. Our calculations also gave us arguments to propose distinct reaction routes, whose mutual predominance would depend upon reaction temperature. At temperatures up to 573 K, the so-called beta-route, which goes through scission of a C-beta-H bond and formation of an oxametallacycle-like intermediate, would dominate the coupling, whereas at higher temperatures, up to 673 K, a more usual Guerbet mechanism, via an aldol coupling step and then consecutive hydrogenations, would be expected. The theoretical conclusions were followed by a careful experimental strategy using sequential experimental planning techniques in order to estimate accurate parameters with the lowest possible experimental load. Information from these different sources was coupled to develop a mathematical model for the rate of the ethanol upgrading reaction, using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson approach. The developed and statistically validated model adequately described the experimental data at 673 K and 1.1 bar total pressure for ethanol partial pressures in the range from 0 to 20 kPa.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500069

Heterogeneous photocatalysts recently have gained growing attention to build such catalytic system for controllable reaction kinetics and enhanced activity. Incorporating a metal catalyst into the framework of the photocatalyst could endow unique metallaphotoredox platforms. Herein, we assemble carbon nitride and nickel (C3N4-Ni) via direct coordination of Ni2+ to C3N4 nitrogen, for visible-light-driven carbon-oxygen cross-coupling. By operating with an imidazole auxiliary ligand, C3N4-Ni efficiently catalyzed etherification of a variety of aryl bromides with alcohols or hydroxylation with water, exhibiting turnover numbers of >500. Ni maintained as isolated single site without aggregation after photoreaction and the recovered catalyst demonstrate sustained activity without additional Ni loading. Our work signifies the potential of uniting dual catalysis in well-designed sensitizer-metal architecture for complex organic transformations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500070

However, the formation of highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles is challenging because they are easily sintered. Here, we studied Cu nanoparticle formation by a simple deposition-reduction technique using Cu-doped MgAl2O4 (Mg1-xCuxAl2O4). Mg(1-)xCu(x)Al(2)O(4) possessed the following three types of Cu2+ species: short O-Cu octahedrally coordinated [CuO6](s), elongated O-Cu octahedrally coordinated [CuO6](el), and tetrahedrally coordinated [CuO4](t). The former two are found in the inverse-spinel-type Mg1-xCuxAl2O4, while the other is found in the normal-spinel-type Mg1-xCuxAl2O4. Additionally, by focusing on the difference in the reducibility of the Cu2+ species, we clarified that their fraction is related to Cu loading. For low Cu loading (x < 0.3), Mg1-xCuxAl2O4 mainly contained the [CuO6](s) species. On the other hand, for high Cu loading (x = 0.3), the fraction of the [CuO6](el) and [CuO4](t) species increased. Notably, among the prepared catalysts, H-2-reduced Mg0.8Cu0.2Al2O4 (x = 0.2) had the largest number of exposed metallic Cu sites, resulting in its good catalytic performance. Hence, the H-2 reduction of [CuO6](s) is essential for forming metallic Cu nanoparticles on metal oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500071

Its conversion to valuable products is extremely attractive but especially challenging without additional hydrogen sources. Herein we report a hydrogen-free production of 4-alkylphenols directly from native lignin via self-reforming-driven depolymerization and hydrogenolysis over Pt/NiAl2O4. This is the first example of acquiring 4-alkylphenols from native lignin. Using this strategy, high yields of 4-alkylphenols, 17.3 wt %, were obtained from birch lignin. Reaction pathway and mechanism studies revealed that this strategy initiates from the reforming of aliphatic hydroxys, followed by the cleavage of C-O linkages, and ends via demethoxylation over Pt/NiAl2O4. Moreover, the subsequent aqueous phase reforming of the as-formed methanol accelerates the whole process. This strategy realizes the one-pot production of 4-alkylphenols from lignin by fully utilizing the structural hydrogen in lignin and H2O, providing a low-cost and safe method of lignin valorization.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500074

Herein, a new class of ternary (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic is developed with excellent performance toward alkaline HOR. Specifically, the Pd-substitution facilitates the formation of L1(2)-Pt3Fe intermetallic at a lower annealing temperature. Electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations indicate that the in-situ formed interstitial alloying PdHx during the electrochemical cycle widens the d-band structure of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe and shifts downward the d-band center toward the Fermi level. The optimized ligand effect from PdHx gives rise to the encouraging activity for alkaline HOR. Meanwhile, a stepby-step monitoring technique and ex situ CO-stripping voltammetry jointly demonstrate that ordered atoms' arrangement of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic contributes to stabilize the local coordination environment and enables the maintenance of the ligand effect from the in situ formed Fe/Fe(OH)(x) heterostructure. Negligible decay in electrochemical surface areas of (Pt0.9Pd0.1)(3)Fe intermetallic after a given accelerated durability test confirms the significant advantage in stability over Pt3Fe alloy. This work sheds light on the significance of ligand effects optimization and real-time tracing of the catalytic process to the structure-activity relationship establishment and subsequent catalyst designs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500075

However, it remains a great challenge to design a competitive HDO catalyst for selectively converting glycerol into 1,3-PDO owing to the higher thermodynamic stability of 1,2-PDO. In this work, theoretical analysis and first principles calculations were adopted for the design and development of an efficient HDO catalyst. The designed Pt/W/beta catalyst has low Pt and W loadings, and exhibits high performance in the HDO reaction with glycerol conversion (84.2%), 1,3-PDO selectivity (46.1%), and total C-3 alcohol selectivity (>90%) under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, experimental structure-performance relationship of the HDO catalyst was found to be consistent with our first principles prediction, confirming the important role of the interfacial structure in the HDO reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500076

Control of aromatic distribution and enhancement of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) selectivity are still a big challenge. Decoupling the complex reaction network, the relative activity of aromatization and alkylation on ZSM-5 determines the aromatic distribution. Herein, the STA reaction was studied over Cr2O3/ZSM-5 to reveal the influence of the zeolite morphology parameters on aromatic distribution. Using the "substitution ratio of aromatic ring" SC9+/A to reflect the relative rate of alkylation to aromatization, the linear dependence of SC9+/A on the morphology parameter (1/b) of ZSM5 was revealed. The methodology for control of aromatic distribution by altering the crystal size of ZSM-5 along the b-axis is then proposed. By further enhancing the aromatization activity via ion exchange of Zn to ZSM-5, a bifunctional catalyst showing a high BTX space time yield of 2.47 mmol g(-1) h(-1) (on carbon base) with 49.1% BTX fraction is developed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500077

Heteroatom-doped and/or -derived Cu as oxide-derived Cu has been investigated in context of development of a stable catalyst with high selectivity, whereas the role of heteroatoms is not yet well understood. It is not known whether heteroatoms act as a moiety of the catalyst or simply induce reconstruction of the catalyst. This work is an investigation of the role of the heteroatom in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a Cu electrode modified with methanethiol monolayers (MT-Cu), which is able to distinguish the presence of heteroatom contamination originating from electrolyte or air. Controlled potential electrolysis of CO2 using an MT-Cu electrode at -1.8 V at Ag/AgCl exhibits greater selectivity for C-2 products than an unmodified polycrystalline Cu electrode (bare Cu). On the other hand, a sulfur-modified Cu (S-Cu) electrode predominantly generates formate as a CO2 reduction product. In an investigation of the mechanism, an in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy instrument is used as a powerful surface analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy, grazing-incidence wideangle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) are also employed in the investigation. The spectroscopic data show that reconstruction and formation of Cu+ on the Cu surface occur at negative potential greater than -1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl by electrochemical reduction of methanethiol monolayers. DFT calculations are also performed under conditions close to the experimental conditions of electrical bias and aqueous electrolyte. The results indicate that a roughened surface is favorable for generating C-2 products. In addition, the Cu+ moiety promotes generation of C-2 products, demonstrating that the doped heteroatom plays a crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500078

Here, time- and temperature-dependent NMR spectroscopic studies reveal alkene complexes that were missed when lower substrate-tocatalyst ratios were used. To aid in rigorous comparison of the experiment with theory, but-1-ene and isomers were used as the simplest isomerizable alkenes, and both the fast reaction of but-1-ene to form (E)-but-2-ene and the very slow reaction of (Z)-but-2-ene were performed. Temperature-dependent rate constants were obtained from fits to the time-dependent concentration profiles. The resulting Arrhenius activation energies allow comparison to a computational model. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the butene isomerization mechanism considered several pathways. Binding of the butene to the catalyst in an exo-orientation is predicted to be the initial step of the preferred pathway for forming but-2-ene, with the E isomer favored over the Z by virtue of lower steric interactions while bound to the catalyst. Experimental observation of the butene-catalyst complex establishes that the rate-determining step precedes formation of the but-2ene-catalyst complex, and DFT calculations identify breaking of the Ru-N bond with formation of a weaker agostic interaction of an allylic C-H and torsion about the Ru-P bond in a key allylic intermediate as close competitors for the rate-determining step. Experimental values for selected thermodynamic parameters of the but-1-ene isomerization were also obtained.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000608850500079

ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			13932	13945		10.1021/acscatal.0c03764				DEC 4 2020	2020	The structural and energetic features of phosphate and phosphonate hydrolysis in protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and water are studied using quantum mechanical (QM) cluster models. The calculations are able to reproduce observed kinetic isotope effects and capture several key trends in the experimental Brmnsted plots: the (beta)lg values are rather different for phosphate and phosphonate ester hydrolysis in solution but are similar in PP1. Detailed analyses of the structures, charge distributions, and bond orders of computed transition states support the general conclusion from experimental study that phosphoryl transfer transition states are different for the two classes of substrates in solution but similar in PP1. On the other hand, the microscopic models also highlight notable differences between the phosphate and phosphonate transition states, which are manifested in not only structure but also kinetic isotope effects. Overall, we find that while beta(lg)/beta(EQ,lg) generally correlates with the partial charge on leaving group oxygen and the fractional bond order of the breaking P-O-lg bond, the precise mapping between beta(lg)/beta(EQ,lg) and P-O-lg bond order in the transition state is difficult due largely to the crosstalk between breaking and forming P-O bonds. Therefore, in further support of previous analyses of the limitations of free energy relations, our results suggest that while the free energy relation is a valuable tool for probing the nature of the transition state, a quantitative mapping of beta(lg) and beta(lg)/beta(EQ,lg )values to structure or charge in the transition state should be conducted with great care.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200017	34567831

Previous catalytic measurements and molecular characterization of boron-based catalysts by B-11 solid-state NMR spectroscopy and other techniques suggest that oxidized/hydrolyzed boron clusters are the catalytically active sites for ODH. However, B-11 solid-state NMR spectroscopy often suffers from limited resolution because boron-11 is an I = 3/2 half-integer quadrupolar nucleus. Here, ultrahigh magnetic field (B-0 = 35.2 T) is used to enhance the resolution of B-11 solid-state NMR spectra and unambiguously determine the local structure and connectivity of boron species in h-BN nanotubes used as an ODH catalyst (spent h-BNNT), boron-substituted MCM-22 zeolite (B-MWW), and silica-supported boron oxide (B/SiO2) before and after use as an ODH catalyst. One-dimensional direct excitation B-11 NMR spectra recorded at B-0 = 35.2 T are near isotropic in nature, allowing for the easy identification of all boron species. Two-dimensional (2D) H-1-B-11 heteronuclear correlation NMR spectra aid in the identification of boron species with B-OH functionality. Most importantly, 2D B-11 dipolar double-quantum single-quantum homonuclear correlation NMR experiments were used to unambiguously probe boron-boron connectivity within all heterogeneous catalysts. These experiments are practically infeasible at lower, more conventional magnetic fields due to a lack of resolution and reduced NMR sensitivity. The detailed molecular structures determined for the amorphous oxidized/hydrolyzed boron layers on these heterogeneous catalysts will aid in the future development of next-generation ODH catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200009	34413990

However, the construction of medium-sized fluoro-functionalized heterocycles remains unexplored. Their synthesis represents a formidable challenge due to the unfavorable entropic and enthalpic factors that arise from medium-sized rings and the unexpected properties induced by fluorinated groups. Here, we describe an efficient method for the preparation of highly functionalized gem-difluoromethylene N-heterocyclic lactones with 9- to 11-membered rings in a sequential CN-bond-cleaving ring-expansion process using difluoro-oxindoles, various zwitterion precursors, and a Pd catalyst. This sequential CN-cleaving expansion process was extended to synthesize nonfluorinated, medium-sized heterocycles with an a-keto-lactone moiety using isatin derivatives. Additionally, monofluorinated and nonfluorinated oxindoles were transformed into the corresponding medium-sized heterocyclic lactones using this protocol. The key for this transformation is the cleavage of the unreactive amide CN bond, which is smartly activated by the incorporation of two neighboring electron-withdrawing groups assisted with the nucleophilic attack of a Pd- coordinated zwitterion. The site-selective functionalization of a series of heterocyclic products was demonstrated to show their synthetic utility. Mechanistic details of the sequential cleavage/expansion process were proposed based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200032

The challenge is especially difficult because the catalyst needs to distinguish the inversion of a single hydroxyl and the alpha or beta glycosidic bonds that join monosaccharide building blocks. Here, we report synthetic glycosidase prepared through molecular imprinting within a cross-linked micelle. The nanoparticle catalyst resembles natural enzymes in dimension, water solubility, and a hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface-core topology. Its boronic acid functionalized active site binds its targeted glycoside substrate and an acid cofactor simultaneously, with the acidic group in close proximity to the exocyclic glycosidic oxygen. The hydrophobically anchored acid cofactor is tunable in acidity and causes selective cleavage of the targeted glycoside in mildly acidic water. Selectivity for both the glycan and the alpha/beta glycosidic bond can be rationally designed through the molecular imprinting process.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200004	34123483

Although the impact of the electrolyte alkalinity on the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO2RR and CORR, respectively) has been extensively investigated on Cu surfaces, systematic investigation of the pH dependence of the surface Cu speciation has been lacking. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the pH dependence of Cu surface speciation and CO adsorption configuration in weakly to strongly alkaline electrolytes using in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Oxygen-containing species, e.g., CuOx/(OH)(y), are absent in near-neutral electrolyte of KHCO3 (pH = 8.9), and their onset potential becomes more positive with increasing the alkalinity of electrolytes. Concurrently, adsorbed CO transitions from atop-bonded (COatop) to bridge-bonded configuration (CObridge) as the pH of the electrolyte increases. CO is proposed to adsorb in the atop configuration only on Cu sites without neighboring oxygen-containing species, while the appearance of the CObridge band correlates with the presence of the oxygen-containing species. Surface speciation on Cu microparticles (Cu MPs) and oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) are similar in all the electrolytes investigated, while the CO adsorption bands show subtle differences on these two surfaces, reflecting variations in the microenvironment of CO adsorbed in the same configuration. Selectivity for C2+ products in the CORR on Cu MPs increases with the electrolyte alkalinity at -0.4 V-RHE, which correlates with the presence of the oxygen-containing Cu species. However, the presence of the oxygen-containing Cu species alone is shown to be an unreliable predictor of the CORR performance on Cu MPs and OD-Cu, which could be attributed to the difference in the microenvironment of the surface Cu sites. Results reported in this work highlight that the assumption that the surface Cu speciation under reducing potentials is independent of the electrolyte pH must be treated with caution.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200001

However, the full potential of the strategy cannot be realized unless the activated C-H bonds are stereochemically controlled. The enantioselective C-H bond functionalization could provide an imperative tool for a sustainable way of synthesizing chiral complex molecular scaffolds. Despite the intrinsic challenges in achieving stereocontrol, the synthetic community has developed different tools in order to achieve stereoselective C-H bond functionalization.

It is traditionally produced by acid hydrolysis/enzymolysis of chitin but suffers from possible individual allergenic risk, serious environmental pollution, and low production yield. A recent rising approach for glucosamine production is microbial fermentation using engineered microorganisms to manufacture N-acetylglucosamine, followed by acid hydrolysis of N-acetylglucosamine to glucosamine. However, this approach does not produce glucosamine in one-pot, and suffers from environmental issues caused by the acid hydrolysis process. To produce cost-competitive glucosamine with environmental sustainability, we demonstrated an artificial in vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystem comprised of five cascade enzymes for biomanufacturing glucosamine from maltodextrin and inorganic ammonia in one-pot. This nonshellfish-derived, phosphate-balanced, and coenzyme-free synthetic enzymatic biosystem was optimized in terms of pH value, enzyme composition, phosphate concentration, and ammonia concentration. The optimized enzyme cocktail converted 10 g/L maltodextrin to 7.9 g/L glucosamine with a conversion efficiency of 75.8% mol/mol glucose equivalent of maltodextrin. Moreover, a simple scaling-up for this nonfermentative biomanufacturing biosystem was performed to investigate its industrial potential, giving out 23.7 g/L glucosamine from 50 g/L maltodextrin.

Whereas such alkynylations typically utilize pyridinium, quinolinium, and isoquinolinium intermediates, this method enables use of cyclic iminium ions unstabilized by resonance. With the use of a Lewis acid and copper catalyst, these iminium ions are generated in situ from readily available hemiaminal methyl ethers and transformed into highly enantioenriched alpha-alkynylated cyclic amines. A variety of terminal al es can be incorporated in high yields and enantiomeric excesses.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200006

They often operate through high substrate specificity for catalysis. How such specificity is achieved is unclear. Here, we dealt with this question by investigating all-alpha dimeric deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolases (dUTPases). Typically, these dUTPases hydrolyze either dUTP or deoxyuridine diphosphate (dUDP) substrates. However, the dUTPase enzyme DR2231 from Deinococcus radiodurans selectively hydrolyzes dUTP only, and not dUDP. By means of extended classical molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations, we show that DR2231 achieves this specificity for dUTP via second-shell basic residues that, together with the two catalytic magnesium ions, contribute to properly orienting the gamma-phosphate of dUTP in a prereactive state. This allows a nucleophilic water to be correctly placed and activated in order to perform substrate hydrolysis. We show that this enzymatic mechanism is not viable when dUDP is bound to DR2231. Importantly, in several other dUTPases capable of hydrolyzing either dUTP or dUDP, we detected that active site second-shell basic residues are more in number, anchoring the beta-phosphate of the nucleotide substrate too, in contrast to what is observed in DR2231. Thus, strategically located basic second-shell residues mediate precise reactant positioning at the catalytic site, determining substrate specificity in dUTPases and possibly in other structurally similar nucleotide-processing metalloenzymes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200007

Here, we explain from first-principles calculations the HER activity of an industrial material known for its superior physical properties and chemical inertness. We find that, compared to bulk termination, a major surface reconstruction takes place, leading to the off-stoichiometric B-rich surface termination that contains the active sites. The hydrogen adsorbate configurations are further investigated under various adsorbate coverages. Many competing configurations appear to be accessible in reaction conditions, and thus, a grand canonical ensemble is established to describe the catalytic system. A phase diagram of adsorbate coverages is constructed as a function of pH and the applied potential. A complex reaction network is presented based on the ensemble-averaged reaction rates, and the electrocatalytic activities are evaluated under different overpotentials. The major contributors to the activity are found to be a few metastable surface states with a distinct electronic structure that are only accessible at high adsorbate coverages in reaction conditions. In addition, while the activity of the dominant active site is nearly the same as that on the unreconstructed WB, the B-rich formations play an important role of isolating the active sites and preventing the passivation of the surface with H-2 bubble formation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200010

Oxygen transfer from AgOx to Pd and the surface reactivity toward CO were investigated as a function of the Pd coverage using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results show that all of the oxygen from the AgO, layer (similar to 0.375 monolayer) migrates to the surface of Pd during formation of a nearly complete Pd bilayer at 300 K and that the oxygen coverages generated on Pd increase as the Pd cluster size decreases, reaching values that exceed the oxygen concentration in the AgOx layer by as much as a factor of 2. Experimental measurements and DFT calculations show that preferential binding of oxygen on the edges of the Pd clusters enhances the oxygen coverage on Pd clusters of decreasing size and produces a heterogeneous spatial distribution of oxygen. CO adsorbs in high coverages at 100 K by binding on both the terraces and O-rich edges of the Pd clusters. During subsequent heating, oxidation of the adsorbed CO consumes nearly all of the oxygen that transferred from AgOx to the Pd domains; in contrast, the pure AgOx layer exhibits limited reactivity toward CO adsorbed at 100 K. These results demonstrate that differences in oxophilicity drive facile oxygen transfer from Ag to the edges of Pd nanoclusters and thereby give rise to an efficient pathway for CO oxidation on bimetallic PdAg surfaces. The cooperation between the Pd and Ag domains results in near-interfacial chemistry that may be broadly important in catalysis by bimetallic alloys.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200011

There have been detailed investigations on the selective production of DHA and GA through the platinum-catalyzed electrochemical oxidation of glycerol, which is a surplus byproduct from biodiesel. However, less attention has been paid to the electrochemical behavior of DHA and GA themselves. Her; we report the electrochemical reduction of DHA and GA at different pH on platinum and palladium electrodes. Palladium exhibits a superior activity toward both the dehydroxylation and hydrogenation of DHA and GA. Using online high-performance liquid chromatography, we show that both DHA and GA display a two-step reduction. In particular, DHA is reduced first to acetol and then sequentially to acetone, while GA is first reduced to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), followed by hydrogenation to 1,3-propanediol. The reduction of both molecules is accompanied by a poisoning of the catalyst surface. In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements suggest adsorbed carbon monoxide as the poisoning species, resulting from the dissociative adsorption of DHA and GA. Mechanistic reaction pathways for both DHA and GA reduction are proposed and discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200013

The structure of ionic liquid-type (IL) molecular modifiers was systematically varied regarding spacer, side chain, and anion to assess the influence on the NP synthesis and their catalytic properties. Well-dispersed Rh NPs with diameters in the range of 0.6-2.0 nm were formed on all SILP materials, whereby the actual size was dependent significantly on the IL structure. The resulting variations in catalytic activity for hydrogenation of the C=O moiety in furfuralacetone allowed control of the product selectivity to obtain either the saturated alcohol or the ketone in high yield. Experiments conducted under batch and continuous flow conditions demonstrated that Rh NPs immobilized on SILPs with suitable IL structures are more active and much more stable than Rh@SiO2 catalyst synthesized on unmodified silica.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200014	33343998

L-Glutamate is an ideal material for the production of L-ABA through gamma-decarboxylation; however, enzyme-mediated gamma-decarboxylation of L-glutamate has not yet been reported. Here, this goal was achieved through isomerization of L-glutamate to (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartate by glutamate mutase (GM) and beta-decarboxylation of 3-methylaspartate by L-aspartate-beta-decarboxylase (Asd). Although the activity of wild-type Asd toward 3-methylaspartate could not be detected, a mutant Asd exhibiting high activity was isolated on the basis of enzyme engineering. The conversion of L-glutamate to L-ABA achieved 98.9%, which provided a more cost-effective process for L-ABA industrial production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200015

The vanadium cluster structures are based on experimental NMR measurements. The first step is Lewis acid-base addition of NH3 to a vanadium site for the neutral and formation of an "NH4+" site on the protonated surface. Different proton transfer pathways, which depend on the initial neutral or protonated sites coupled with addition of NO lead to the formation of NH2NO surface species. The mechanisms can be complicated involving many different pathways for the proton transfers, especially for the initial protonated surface. The addition of the doublet NO leading to the formation of NH2NO leads to a reduction of a vanadium and transfer of the spin to this site. NH2NO desorbs and then undergoes gas-phase rearrangements to form the final products N-2 + H2O. The barrier heights for the gas-phase rearrangement process leading to final product formation are comparable in a number of cases to the barrier heights on the catalyst and may represent the rate-determining step. The reaction on the cluster model with a reduced vanadium(+4) proceeds by different paths with addition of NO leading to a second reduced vanadium site. The predicted pathways are consistent with the available experimental data and show that the complete SCR mechanism is very complicated as additional H2O molecules will be removed from the surface by the addition of O-2 to fully regenerate the catalyst and oxidize V back to the formal +5 state.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200016

However, the wild-type enzyme cannot effectively catalyze the C4 hydroxylation of L-Iysine to form the product. To overcome this bottleneck we modified the t-lysine hydroxylase from Niastella koreensis (NkLH4), using the semirational combinatorial active-site saturation test (CAST). We obtained a highly active mutant MT3 (Q161N/T162A/F178Y/E260D) with a 24.97-fold increase of k(cat)/K-m, compared with the wild-type enzyme (791.33 mM(-1) s(-1) vs 31.69 rnM(-1) s(-1)). Further analysis of the structure-activity relationship via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that MT3 had a more flexible conformation, as well as an enlarged substrate-binding pocket with decreased steric hindrance and increased binding energy in substrate recognition. Our study provides a highly active NkLH4 mutant for potential commercial use in the production of enantiomerically pure (2S,4R)-4-hydroxylysine.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200018

An increase in PDH yield via added catalyst activity, lifetime, or selectivity represents significant energy and economic savings. Using Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudate supports as a commercially relevant model system, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats, used to tailor metal-active sites, can increase PDH yield and selectivity. We investigate the interplay of Pt loading, ALD overcoat thickness, and Al2O3 support surface area on PDH activity, selectivity, and catalyst stability to show that applying a 6-8 A thick layer of Al2O3 on low-surface area Al2O3 supports of similar to 90 m(2)/g surface area yields the optimal combination of stability and activity, while increasing propylene selectivity from 91 to 96%. Increased stability upon steaming deactivation occurs because the Al2O3 overcoat prevents the Pt nanoparticles from sintering. We speculate that the ALD overcoat selectively binds to the undercoordinated sites on the Pt nanoparticles, while leaving the more selective terrace sites available for dehydrogenation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200019

A prospective route for directly obtaining H2O2 is aqueous reduction of O-2 using carbon monoxide (CO) as a reducing agent. However, homogeneous catalysts reported in the literature typically lack the required level of performance in mild ligand-and additive-free conditions. Here, we demonstrate that gold nano-particles supported on titania (Au/TiO2), which is a well-known catalyst for CO oxidation at subambient temperature, can catalyze the formation of H2O2 from the reaction of CO and O-2 in aqueous solution at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. We show that, benefiting from the intrinsic CO/H2O-induced Au-H formation capability of the Au-TiO2 interface, this hitherto unappreciated system can deliver up to 9097 mmol(H2O2) g(Au)(-1) h(-1) efficiency for direct and stable H2O2 production. In addition to the high productivity, a more relevant performance was demonstrated in the vacuum distillative processing of the diluted H2O2-containing streams to furnish a range of pure H2O2 solutions up to 32 wt %. The practical and straightforward application of this H2O2-generating system provides an expedient and efficient entry to establish a sequential tandem process where CO is initially converted to H2O2 and H2O2 subsequently serves as a benign oxidant for selective oxyfunctionalization of aromatic hydrocarbons.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200023

Unlike the mature narrations of the mechanism on the metal catalyst, the mechanism of ODH on the nanocarbon catalyst is still disputable and inconclusive. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and microkinetic modeling (MKM) are combined to provide unique insights into the mechanism. Four possible mechanisms were studied, which are Eley-Rideal (ER), Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH), and Mars-van Krevelen (MvK), together with the reactions between weakly adsorbed species and radicals. The simulation clearly identified the mechanism of the reaction that the ER pathway is more likely than both LH and MvK pathways under various conditions. Carbonyl groups are the main active sites for the first hydrogen abstraction of ethylbenzene. On the other hand, the hydrogen abstraction from intermediate hydrocarbons (such as C6H5CHCH3 center dot) by O-2* and HO2 center dot yields a significant contribution to the total reaction rate under certain conditions. The reaction is first-order in ethylbenzene and zero-order in O-2 when the ratio of reactants nears stoichiometry. Moreover, the defective site does not affect the intrinsic catalytic performance. The defective site is subsequently transformed into the carbonyl group at the steady state and thus increases the number of active sites. This study provides a decisive description of the mechanism of ODH on nanocarbon catalysts under various reaction conditions and sheds light on design of the catalyst and optimization of reaction conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200024

This strategy utilizes abundant saline water as an electrolyte and source of oxygen atoms for functionalization. We present a mechanistic study of ethylene oxidation in saline water using cobalt oxide nanoparticle catalysts. Electrochemical kinetic analysis and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggest that the resting state of the catalyst and the rate-determining step differ for the chlorine evolution reaction in the presence and absence of ethylene. In 0.6 M NaCl pH 8 electrolyte, which resembles seawater, the average current density was similar to 60 mA/cm(2) with a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 41% toward ethylene functionalization. The use of synthetic and natural seawater achieved Faradaic efficiencies above 70%, while the partial current toward the product remained invariant. Further conversion of the initial product 2-chloroethanol into ethylene glycol was also demonstrated. We present a broader vision of harnessing saline water in electrochemical functionalization of organic molecules and coproduction of hydrogen.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200025

Frustrated Lewis Pairs have conceptually revolutionized the activation of inert chemical bonds. Far less developed are hybrid systems containing at least one transition metal as part of the electron-donating/accepting composition. These cooperative transition metal architectures present advantages over traditional systems. For instance, they incorporate, to the concept of FLPs, the movement of electron pairs as typically encountered in the elementary steps of organometallic catalysis. This Perspective presents arguably the most relevant and recent progress of a vivid field of research that aspires to implement cooperative designs in polarized transition metal systems. Moreover, it provides tools for future developments and shows that molecular control over bond-making and -breaking processes can be achieved.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200026

This imposed a requirement that the catalyst return to its original state at the end of each experiment-a complete reversibility requirement. For real catalysts, fulfilling the reversibility requirement is often impossible-catalysts under reaction conditions may change their chemical composition and structure as they become activated or while they are being poisoned through use. It is therefore desirable to develop high-speed methods where transient rates can be quickly measured while catalysts are changing. In this work, we present velocity-resolved kinetics using high-repetition-rate pulsed laser ionization and high-speed ion imaging detection. The reaction is initiated by a single molecular beam pulse incident at the surface, and the product formation rate is observed by a sequence of pulses produced by a high-repetition-rate laser. Ion imaging provides the desorbing product flux (reaction rate) as a function of reaction time for each laser pulse. We demonstrate the principle of this approach by rate measurements on two simple reactions: CO desorption from and CO oxidation on the 332 facet of Pd. This approach overcomes the time-consuming scanning of the delay between CO and laser pulses needed in past experiments and delivers a data acquisition rate that is 10-1000 times higher. We are able to record kinetic traces of CO2 formation while a CO beam titrates oxygen atoms from an O-saturated surface. This approach also allows measurements of reaction rates under diffusion-controlled conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200027	33343999

A Computational Study								ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			14067	14079		10.1021/acscatal.0c03490				DEC 4 2020	2020	Vanadium haloperoxidases are one of the few enzymes in nature that utilize a vanadium center and catalyze the halogenation of substrates through the biosynthesis of hypohalite. Vanadium chloroperoxidases (VCPOs) bind and activate hydrogen peroxide and in a reaction with chloride convert it into hypochlorite as a precursor for a substrate chlorination reaction. Despite the fact that these enzymes have been studied extensively, surprisingly little is known on their catalytic cycle and particularly on the function of the vanadium atom in the reaction mechanism. In order to gain insight into the intricate details of the catalytic cycle of VCPOs, we performed an extensive computational study using large cluster model complexes, where we tested many possible pathways and active-site protonation states. Our work establishes that the biosynthesis of hypochlorite proceeds in two steps: H2O2 activation on the vanadium center to form an end-on V(V)-hydroperoxo complex, followed by OH* transfer from hydroperoxo to chloride on the vanadium center to form hypochlorite. We show that the initial reaction starts with a proton transfer from H2O2 to the equatorial OH group of the V-V(O)(2)(OH)(2)(-) active site, followed by hydroperoxo binding and water release to form the highly stable vanadium-hydroperoxo-dioxo-hydroxo complex. A further proton transfer from an active-site His or Lys residue can lead to the vanadium-peroxo-hydroxo-oxo complex, which we assign as a dead-end complex unable to react further to hypochlorite products. The mechanisms were considered under various protonation state, and it is shown to be the most effective with His(404) singly protonated. The work shows that vanadium is a spectator ion that does not change its oxidation state during the reaction mechanism but holds and positions the H2O2 substrate and guides its proton-relay steps through its oxo and hydroxo ligands. The effect of the protonation state of first- and second-coordination sphere residues and ligands was tested and shows that the reaction is highly sensitive to local changes in the protonation state. Finally, the computations show that the oxygen atom of HOCl exclusively derives from H2O2.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200028

Gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs), composed of solid electrocatalysts on porous supports positioned near the interface of a conducting electrolyte and CO2 gas, have been able to demonstrate the substantial current densities needed for future commercialization. These higher reaction rates have often been ascribed to the presence of a three-phase interface, where solid, liquid, and gas provide electrons, water, and CO2, respectively. Conversely, mechanistic work on electrochemical reactions implicates a fully two-phase reaction interface, where gas molecules reach the electrocatalyst's surface by dissolution and diffusion through the electrolyte. Because the discrepancy between an atomistic three-phase versus two-phase reaction has substantial implications for the design of catalysts, gas-diffusion layers, and cell architectures, the nuances of nomenclatures and governing phenomena surrounding the three-phase-region require clarification. Here we outline the macro, micro, and atomistic phenomena occurring within a gas-diffusion electrode to provide a focused discussion on the architecture of the often-discussed three-phase region for CO2 electrolysis. From this information, we comment on the outlook for the broader CO2 electroreduction GDE cell architecture.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200030

Herein, beta-ketamine/iron complexes, combining a strategy employing in situ generated iodine as a regulator, have been developed for improving the efficiency and robustness of iron-catalyzed ATRP. The catalyst system realizes low catalyst loading, ultrahigh molecular weight, robustness over polar groups, efficient polymerization of acrylate, and forthrightly synthesizing block copolymers, which are challengeable for common iron catalysts. A mechanism was proposed based on experimental results, which mainly involves the ATRP activation process by Fe(II) and the I-2-mediated deactivation process.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200033

The nature of these Sn species was systematically investigated by several approaches, including DRIFT, XPS, UV-vis, and solid-state Sn-119 MAS NMR spectroscopy. The subtle distinctions of the Lewis acidic features between the framework and extraframework Sn sites were identified via acetone-2-C-13, TMPO, and NH3 adsorption, studied via C-13, P-31, and H-1 MAS NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Two types of Lewis acid sites (LAS) have been observed and attributed to (i) framework Sn sites and (ii) extraframework SnOx clusters confined inside the pores or cages of [Si]Beta zeolite, both exhibiting Lewis acid properties. The Lewis acidic characteristics of the extraframework Sn sites were found to depend on the cluster sizes. The confined SnOx clusters with sizes of 0.5-2 nm possess Lewis acidic characteristics similar to those of the framework Sn species and also exhibit a comparable catalytic activity in the Baeyer-Villiger (B-V) oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene oxide hydration. With an increase in size of the SnOx clusters to over 2 nm, the Lewis acidic characteristics of the extraframework Sn species gradually weaken or even disappear.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200034

This win-win situation addresses the ever-increasing problems associated with excessive CO2 emission as well as renewable energy supply. In this contribution, a thorough study is realized on 10 MR zeolites with one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to gasoline (C-5-C-11), with a high fraction of multibranched isoparaffins. Emphasis is placed on identifying the factors that favor isomerization and increase the number of branches on the isomers. Zeolites SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 were configured with Na/Fe3O4 (NaFe) in single-, dual-, and various triple-bed arrangements for this investigation. A dual-bed reaction with SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 coupled individually with the NaFe catalyst showed relatively higher selectivity for low-branched isoparaffins and aromatics, respectively. In the event of combining both the zeolites with NaFe as a physical mix and triple-bed systems, isoparaffins selectivity increased with improved multibranched isomers and reduced aromatics at the same time. Among these different tactics, the triple-bed system comprising the NaFe catalyst followed sequentially with SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 maximizes the selectivity for isoparaffins with the enhanced formation of multibranched isomers. The selectivity of gasoline reached 71.7% in hydrocarbons (HCs) with a maximum of 38.2% isoparaffins possessing a RON value of 91.7 at CO2 conversion of 31.2%. Multibranched isomers accounted for 28.3% in all C5+ isoparaffins, much higher than that of the single zeolite. Purposefully, hypothetical knowledge obtained from the prior model reactions on the zeolites served as a strong foundation to support and give insight into the results from the CO2 hydrogenation reactions.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200036

ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			14195	14200		10.1021/acscatal.0c03059				DEC 4 2020	2020	It is well-known that energy-rich radiation induces water splitting, eventually yielding hydrogen peroxide. Synthetic applications, however, are scarce and to the best of our knowledge, the combination of radioactivity with enzyme-catalysis has not been considered yet. Peroxygenases utilize H2O2 as an oxidant to promote highly selective oxyfunctionalization reactions but are also irreversibly inactivated in the presence of too high H2O2 concentrations. Therefore, there is a need for efficient in situ H2O2 generation methods. Here, we show that radiolytic water splitting can be used to promote specific biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization reactions. Parameters influencing the efficiency of the reaction and current limitations are shown. Particularly, oxidative inactivation of the biocatalyst by hydroxyl radicals influences the robustness of the overall reaction. Radical scavengers can alleviate this issue, but eventually, physical separation of the enzymes from the ionizing radiation will be necessary to achieve robust reaction schemes. We demonstrate that nuclear waste can also be used to drive selective, peroxygenase-catalyzed oxyfunctionalization reactions, challenging our view on nuclear waste in terms of sustainability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200037	33312749

Though their structure and reactivity are of great interest for the design of therapeutics, mechanistic details remain elusive. We reveal within a stereoelectronic link between "the most obscure of all the proteases" and the oxyanion hole of serine proteases-the vivid illustration of nature's catalytic strategy of transition state stabilization. Specifically, rate-limiting breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate is facilitated by n -> pi* donation from the forming C-terminus into an active-site glycine. Cooperative H-bonds strengthen this rare, if not unreported, mode of enzyme catalysis in a fashion resembling that found in serine proteases. Exploiting this interaction provides a strategy for the design of next-generation inhibitors.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200038

The activity of corresponding catalytic coatings strongly depends on material properties such as film thickness, crystallinity, electrical conductivity, and chemical surface speciation. Measuring these properties with high accuracy in vacuum-free and non-destructive methods facilitates the elucidation of structure-activity relationships in realistic environments. Here, we report a novel approach to analyze the optical and electrical properties of highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Using a series of differently calcined, mesoporous, templated iridium oxide films as an example, we assess the film thickness, porosity, electrical resistivity, electron concentration, electron mobility, and interband and intraband transition energies by modeling of the optical spectra. Independently performed analyses using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, ellipsometric porosimetry, X-ray reflectometry, and absorption spectroscopy indicate a high accuracy of the deduced material properties. A comparison of the derived analytical data from SE, resonant photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with activity measurements of the OER suggests that the intrinsic activity of iridium oxides scales with a shift of the Ir 5d t(2g) sub-level and an increase of p-d interband transition energies caused by a transition of mu(1)-OH to p mu(3)-O species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200039

C-13 Solid-State NMR Investigation of n-But-1-ene Transformation on Zn-Modified Zeolite								ACS CATALYSIS				10	23			14224	14233		10.1021/acscatal.0c03647				DEC 4 2020	2020	The analysis of n-but-1-ene transformation on Zn-modified zeolite H-BEA, containing zinc exclusively in the form of either Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA sample) or small clusters of ZnO (ZnO/H-BEA sample), has been performed with C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at 296-673 K. The number of intermediates, including pi-complex of n-but-2-ene, methylallylzinc, and delocalized carbanionic species formed by the interaction of oligomeric polyenes with Zn sites, have been identified for both zeolite samples. Methyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cation and cyclohexadienyl cation are additionally identified for the reaction on ZnO/H-BEA. It is inferred that the aromatization of the olefin occurs basically with the involvement of Zn2+ sites on Zn2+/H-BEA. For ZnO/H-BEA, besides aromatization with the assistance of ZnO species, conjunct polymerization process with the involvement of Bronsted acid sites (BAS) contributes notably to the olefin aromatization. The latter process affords also some quantity of C-1-C-4 alkanes. It is concluded that the stronger interaction of the olefin (confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations) and oligomeric polyenes with Zn2+ cations than with ZnO species and different quantities of BAS for two zeolite samples provide peculiar performances of Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites for the olefin aromatization. Based on careful analysis of the obtained spectroscopic results, it is suggested that Zn-modified zeolite containing Zn2+ cationic species and some quantity of BAS should exhibit higher efficiency as the catalyst for small olefin and alkane aromatization compared to the zeolite with ZnO species and high concentration of BAS.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200040

The developed method tolerates coupling partners with disparate electronic properties and substitution patterns. Di- and trisubstituted alkenes as well as alkenes distal from the directing group are all accommodated. Control experiments are consistent with a N-Ni coordination mode of the directing group, which stands in contrast to a previous report on amide-directed 1,2-diarylation, which involves carbonyl coordination. The synthetic utility of the method arises from the dual function of the sulfonamide as both a directing group and a masked amine nucleophile. This is highlighted by various product diversifications where complex amine compounds are synthesized in a two-step sequence of N-functionalization and deprotection of the sulfonyl group.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200041

We used operando time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and time-resolved isotope labeling experiments coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to elucidate the reaction mechanism and study the active sites and intermediates over a Cu/ZnO catalyst during carbon dioxide conversion into methanol. No reduction of the zinc oxide or formation of a copper-zinc alloy was observed even under highly reducing conditions (IS bar of hydrogen, 260 degrees C), which leads to the conclusion that a copper- zinc alloy phase is not required for high methanol yields and selectivity to be obtained. We attribute the reactive superiority of the copper-zinc-based system to the interplay between copper and zinc oxide phases. Our synthesis protocol provides a way to produce this copper-zinc oxide interface, without having to go through an alloy phase.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200042

The catalytic performance of these catalysts was compared to physical mixtures of zeolite and Pt/gamma-Al2O3 powders, which provide a "microscale" distance between sites. Several beneficial effects on catalytic activity and selectivity for n-heptane hydroisomerization were observed when Pt nanoparticles are located on the gamma-Al2O3 binder in nanoscale proximity with zeolite acid sites, as opposed to Pt nanoparticles located inside zeolite crystals. On ZSM-5-based catalysts, mostly monobranched isomers were produced, and the isomer selectivity of these catalysts was almost unaffected with an intimacy ranging from closest to microscale, which can be attributed to the high diffusional barriers of branched isomers within ZSM-5 micropores. For composite catalysts based on large-pore zeolites (zeolite Beta and zeolite Y), the activity and selectivity benefitted from the nanoscale intimacy with Pt, compared to both the closest and microscale intimacies. Intracrystalline gradients of heptenes as reaction intermediates are likely contributors to differences in activity and selectivity. This paper aims to provide insights into the influence of the metal-acid intimacy in bifunctional catalysts based on zeolites with different framework topologies.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200043	33312750

Designing robust catalysts for the production of olefins is a challenge due to the current lack of clarity on the complex CO2 hydrogenation mechanism. This review aims to elucidate the production of olefins from CO2 with an emphasis on material design and existing mechanistic evidence. The major focus is on catalyst design and structure-activity relationships that can mold future progress in this area with significant relevance to industrial implementation. The mechanisms used in these catalytic routes are discussed at length with appropriate examples. Furthermore, practical reactor design, efficient process engineering, and the importance of life cycle analysis are discussed in depth. These are relevant parameters that need to be integrated with catalyst design to overcome scientific and technological challenges to reach the commercial viability of this technology.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200044

Herein, we report on a transition metal-free supramolecular catalyst composed of V-shaped aromatic amphiphiles and a phenoxazine photoredox catalyst. A nanosized molecular capsule can efficiently uptake an organic photoredox catalyst in water, and the supramolecular catalysis can be tuned by choice of the host-guest combination. This system allows for the effective reduction of organic molecules under visible light irradiation and generates various carbon-centered radicals, such as ketyl radicals, aryl radicals, and trifluoromethyl radicals, for organic reactions in water. In particular, the present supramolecular catalysis turns out to be effective for pinacol couplings compared to the photoredox catalysis in organic solvents, and furthermore, it enables recycling of the catalyst and substrate-selective reactions, which are difficult to be achieved by the conventional photoredox catalysis in organic solvents.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200045

The emerging chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs offers a promising approach along this line as demonstrated by recent achievements. However, the stereocontrol elements in these reactions are not clearly recognized thus far. Herein, we analyze the origin of stereoinduction in direct hydrogenation of imines catalyzed by a set of chiral boranes. We use the tools of computational chemistry to describe the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle, and we pay special attention to the stereoselectivity-determining hydride transfer process. The enantioselectivities predicted by the applied computational approach are in very good agreement with previous experimental observations. We find that the stereoselectivity is governed by a thermodynamically less favored conformer of the borohydride intermediate and not by the experimentally observed form. The most favored hydride transfer transition states are stabilized by specific aryl-aryl and alkyl-aryl noncovalent interactions, which play an important role in stereoinduction. This computational insight is exploited in proposing additional borane variants to improve the enantioselectivity, which could be demonstrated experimentally									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200046

Here, we report that TiO2 loaded with dual cocatalysts, that is, nanometals and cobalt oxide (CoOx) nanoclusters, is capable of selectively catalyzing CH4 to CH3OH at room temperature under photoexcitation using abundant and inexpensive O-2 as an oxidant. The best activity for the formation of the primary products, CH3OOH and CH3OH, is up to 50.8 pmol for 2 h with 95% selectivity. Mechanistic studies elucidate that the superior activity and selectivity result from the synergistic effect of nanometals and CoOx. Nanometals enhance CH4 conversion by promoting the separation of the photoexcited electron and the reduction of O-2. The CoOx mediates a mild CH4 oxidation process by suppressing the formation of highly oxidative (OH)-O-center dot radicals that can further oxidize CH3OH to HCHO and CO2, thereby preserving a high selectivity toward oxygenated products. This work provides a prototype in designing efficient photocatalysts for selective oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH with O-2 under mild conditions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200050

Here, we report the efficient merging catalysis of photoredox-driven dehydrogenative C-C coupling of benzyl alcohol (BA) into hydrobenzoin (HB) and H-2 evolution over the SiO2-supported semiconductor CdS quantum dots (QDs) at ambient temperature and pressure. In this system, we utilize the judicious interfacial engineering approach to rationally assemble OH CdS QDs onto the spherical SiO2 support by which CdS QDs can recycle the scattered light in the near field of SiO2 and achieve the significantly enhanced light-harvesting capability and more efficient generation of charge carriers. Consequently, as compared to bare CdS QDs and Pt/SiO2, the SiO2-supported CdS QDs (CdS/SiO2) exhibits distinctly boosted photoredox-catalyzed activity and stability for C-C coupling of BA into HB and H-2 evolution. The underlying origin toward an efficient C-C coupling reaction over CdS/SiO2 is analyzed accordingly. This work would open a conceptual vista of utilizing a near-field scattering-promoted optical absorption model and nanoscale interfacial assembly method to maneuver the light-capturing property of semiconductor QDs without size alteration for solar fuel production and organic synthesis of fine chemicals.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200051

This approach was effective for a broad scope of amino, alkyl, sulfonyl, and phosphinoyl radical precursors as well as various conjugated beta,gamma-unsaturated carboxylic acids. These reactions also feature high regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance, and simple operation procedure.

These insights present a modular and powerful strategy to access versatilely functionalized allyl-containing skeletons from readily available and stable carboxylic acids.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900004	34367721

Designing selective catalysts for any reaction requires an efficient strategy for discovering predictive structure-activity relationships. Herein, we describe the use of iterative supervised principal component analysis (ISPCA) in de novo catalyst design. The regioselective synthesis of 2,5-dimethyl-1,3,4-triphenyl-1H-pyrrole (C) via a Ti-catalyzed formal [2 + 2 + 1] cycloaddition of phenylpropyne and azobenzene was targeted as a proof of principle. The initial reaction conditions led to an unselective mixture of all possible pyrrole regioisomers. ISPCA was conducted on a training set of catalysts, and their performance was regressed against the scores from the top three principal components. Component loadings from this PCA space and k-means clustering were used to inform the design of new test catalysts. The selectivity of a prospective test set was predicted in silico using the ISPCA model, and optimal candidates were synthesized and tested experimentally. This data-driven predictive-modeling workflow was iterated, and after only three generations the catalytic selectivity was improved from 0.5 (statistical mixture of products) to over 11 (>90% C) by incorporating 2,6-dimethyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pyridine as a ligand. The origin of catalyst selectivity was probed by examining ISPCA variable loadings in combination with DFT modeling, revealing that ligand lability plays an important role in selectivity. A parallel catalyst search using multivariate linear regression (MLR), a popular approach in catalysis informatics, was also conducted in order to compare these strategies in a hypothetical catalyst scouting campaign. ISPCA appears to be more robust and predictive than MLR when sparse training sets are used that are representative of the data available during the early search for an optimal catalyst. The successful development of a highly selective catalyst without resorting to long, stochastic screening processes demonstrates the inherent power of ISPCA in de novo catalyst design and should motivate the general use of ISPCA in reaction development.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900034	34327040

Catalyst [Cp*RhI(C,C')-Triaz] shows a superior catalytic performance in terms of activity and has been applied to the hydrosilylation of a range of linear 1-alkynes and phenylacetylene derivatives with diverse hydrosilanes, including HSiMePh2, HSiMe2Ph, HSiEt3, and the bulkier heptamethylhydrotrisiloxane (HMTS), to afford the corresponding beta-(Z)-vinylsilanes in quantitative yields. The graphene-based hybrid material TRGO-Triaz-Rh(III), featuring cyclometalated [Cp*RhI(C,C')-Triaz] (Triaz = 1,4-diphenyl-3-methyl-1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene) rhodium(III) complexes covalently immobilized through the triazolylidene linker, has been prepared by metalation of the trimethylsilyl-protected 3-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3-triazolium iodide functionalized graphene oxide material, TRGO-Triaz, with [Cp*RhCl2](2) using sodium tert-butoxide as base. The coordination sphere of the supported rhodium(III) complexes has been determined by means of XPS and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, showing the replacement of the iodido ligand by O-functionalities on the carbon wall. In sharp contrast with the homogeneous catalyst, the heterogeneous hybrid catalyst TRGO-Triaz-Rh(III) is not active at room temperature although it shows an excellent catalytic performance at 60 degrees C. In addition, the hybrid catalyst TRGO-Triaz-Rh(III) has shown an excellent recyclability, allowing at least six catalytic runs in the hydrosilylation of oct-1-yne with HSiMePh2 in acetone with complete selectivity to the beta-(Z)-vinylsilane product. The reaction mechanism for the molecular catalyst [Cp*RhI(C,C')-Triaz] has been explored by means of DFT calculations, pointing to a metal-ligand bifunctional mechanism involving reversible cyclometalation that is competitive with a noncooperative pathway. The proposed mechanism entails the Rh-C-Ar assisted hydrosilane activation to afford a reactive Rh-silyl intermediate that leads to a (E)-silylvinylene intermediate after alkyne insertion and a metallacyclopropene-driven isomerization. The release of the beta-(Z)-vinylsilane product can occur by a reversible cyclometalation mechanism involving sigma-CAM with the C-Ar-H bond or, alternatively, the Si-H bond of an external hydrosilane. The energy barrier for the latter is 1.2 kcal.mol(-1) lower than that of the C-Ar-H bond, which results in a small energy span difference that makes both pathways competitive under catalytic conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900021

Due to their high selectivity, enzymes have become an essential tool for C-H bond activation and offer complementary reactivity to small-molecule catalysts. Hemoproteins, particularly cytochromes P450, have proven to be effective for selective oxidation of unactivated C-H bonds. Previously, we reported the in vitro characterization of an oxidative tailoring cascade in which TamI, a multifunctional P450, functions co-dependently with the TamL flavoprotein to catalyze regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation and epoxidation to yield tirandamycin A and tirandamycin B. TamI follows a defined order including (1) C10 hydroxylation, (2) C11/C12 epoxidation, and (3) C18 hydroxylation. Here, we present a structural, biochemical, and computational investigation of TamI to understand the molecular basis of its substrate binding, diverse reactivity, and specific reaction sequence. The crystal structure of TamI in complex with tirandamycin C, together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and targeted mutagenesis, suggests that hydrophobic interactions with the polyene chain of its natural substrate are critical for molecular recognition. Quantum mechanics calculations and MD simulations of TamI with variant substrates provided detailed information on the molecular basis of sequential reactivity and pattern of regio- and stereoselectivity in catalyzing the three-step oxidative cascade.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900029	33569241

This revolutionary tool is promising to treat a myriad of human genetic diseases. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of DNA cleavage, which is a fundamental step for genome editing, has not been established. Here, quantum-classical molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy methods are used to disclose the two-metal-dependent mechanism of phosphodiester bond cleavage in CRISPR-Cas9. Ab initio MD reveals a conformational rearrangement of the Mg2+-bound RuvC active site, which entails the relocation of H983 to act as a general base. Then, the DNA cleavage proceeds through a concerted associative pathway fundamentally assisted by the joint dynamics of the two Mg2+ ions. This clarifies previous controversial experimental evidence, which could not fully establish the catalytic role of the conserved H983 and the metal cluster conformation. The comparison with other two-metal-dependent enzymes supports the identified mechanism and suggests a common catalytic strategy for genome editing and recombination. Overall, the non-target DNA cleavage catalysis described here resolves a fundamental open question in the CRISPR-Cas9 biology and provides valuable insights for improving the catalytic efficiency and the metal-dependent function of the Cas9 enzyme, which are at the basis of the development of genome editing tools.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900043	33520346

The mechanism of the multistepped reaction, especially four-electron oxidation to O-2, has not yet been understood. Although some intermediate states have been detected in transient spectroscopy, O-2 evolution kinetics remain unknown at the end of consecutive reaction steps. We apply operando O-2 detection with a microelectrode to determine the absolute evolution rate on a highly efficient SrTiO3 photocatalyst film casted on a glass plate. The evolution rate was determined with a time resolution of 0.1 s, which was improved by 1000 times compared with that in widely used gas-chromatographic detection. The observed rate did not respond instantaneously to excitation light irradiation. When light was turned on, the photocatalyst film was inactive for evolution and light-activated in seconds. It was proposed that the first absorbed photons were consumed to fill trap states on SrTiO3 surface and then the latter photons drove steady O-2 evolution. When excitation light stopped, the O-2 evolution rate exponentially decayed in seconds. The microelectrode method demonstrated herein will be useful for understanding many other reaction kinetics at liquid-solid interfaces.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900001

Here we show a versatile nanoconfined ionic liquids (ILs) design to tune the interactions between CO2 and single-Ni-site, meanwhile create a solid/liquid interface with high CO2 concentration for efficient CO2 electrocatalysis. The Ni-N catalyst confined with ILs can be directly used with aqueous electrolytes to mitigate the mass transport and conductivity issues typically associated with viscous bulk ILs electrolytes. Density functional theory studies reveal that the d-band center of Ni atoms is positively shifted to the Fermi level in the presence of IL, and consequently the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step of CO2 reduction, CO2(g) -> COOH*, drops significantly from 1.49 to 0.80 eV. The nanoconfined ILs intensify CO2 conversion by showing a high CO Faradaic efficiency of above 98%, enhanced current densities up to 66.1 mA cm(-2), and robust stability over 50 h.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900003

For this, we calculate acidity constants at surface sites through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and a Grand Canonical formulation of adsorbates. The resulting pH values at the point of zero charge show excellent agreement with experiment and thereby support the validity of our approach. By combining information concerning the surface coverage with the alignment of the band edges with respect to the relevant redox levels, we scrutinize the potential of the considered semiconductors as photocatalysts and identify the corresponding optimal pH ranges for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. More specifically, our results indicate that GaN stands out among these semiconductors as the most promising candidate for the overall water splitting, with the potential of further improvement through alloying. With the surface coverage, our computational analysis brings a new descriptor that is currently beyond experimental reach.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900005

They are traditionally prepared through nucleophilic addition to imines. These methods often require highly reactive organometallic reagents and proceed under rigorous air- and moisture-free conditions. Here we describe an alternative approach that involves a C-alkylation of amines with alkyl bromides. Mechanistically, the reaction likely involves photocatalytic generation of an alpha-amino radical and a stabilized carbon-centered radical (allyl, benzyl, alpha-carbonyl) followed by radical recombination. This approach offers a mild, atom-economical, redox neutral synthesis of alpha-branched amines that shows broad scope and avoids premetalated reagents.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900006

Nevertheless, the detailed mechanism of this reaction, proceeding via either the Pd(II)-carbenoid or the pi-allyl-Pd(II) intermediate, still remains debatable. Herein, computational studies were performed to provide mechanistic insights into the reactions, and substituent-dependent mechanistic pathways were revealed. Computational results suggest that the substituents, R-1-R-3 attached to 1,2-allenyl ketones and R-4 attached to the aryl moiety of aryl halides, could play significant roles in the variation of the mechanistic pathway. It would be favorable to form the Pd(II)-carbenoid intermediate when R-1 is an aryl/alkyl group or steric hindrance is present between R-2 and R-3. For the substrate of aryl halide, the aryl moiety bearing electron-donating group (R-4) at the para position is more ready to undergo migratory insertion to form the pi-allyl-Pd(II) intermediate than that with electron-withdrawing group. The factors responsible for the formation of both Pd(II)-carbenoid and pi-allyl-Pd(II) intermediates are discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900007

Machine learning (ML) as a starring tool in data science brings new opportunities for chemists to interpret, simulate, and predict complex reactions in heterogeneous catalysis. Here we review the current status of ML methods and applications in heterogeneous catalysis by following two main streams: the top-down approach by learning experiment data and the bottom-up approach for making predictions from first-principles, which differ in the data source. We focus more on the latter, where ML interacts intimately with first-principles calculations for predicting the key properties (e.g., molecular adsorption energy) and evaluating potential energy surface (PES) to expedite the atomic simulation. The ML-based PES exploration represents the top gear that can largely replace the traditional roles of first-principles calculations for structure determination and activity evaluation but requires efficient methods for data set generation, sensitive structure descriptors to discriminate structures, and iterative self-learning to refine the ML potential. We illustrate these key ingredients of ML-based atomic simulation using the SSW-NN method developed by our group as the example. Three cases of SSW-NN application are presented to elaborate how ML can expedite the material and reaction simulation and lead to new findings on catalyst structure and reaction channels. The future directions of ML-based applications in heterogeneous catalysis are also discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900008

Herein, the strong interaction between metal oxide and carbon supports is discovered to significantly boost the performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A molecular engineering strategy is designed to develop undoped, N-doped, S-doped, and N,S-codoped porous carbon supports with similar physical properties (denoted as C, NC, SC, and NSC, respectively). These supports can host high-density SnO2 nanoparticles (over 60 wt. %) in a small size of similar to 3.5 nm and good distribution, providing an excellent platform to understand the strong metal oxide-support interaction (SMOSI) and their influence on electrocatalytic performance. Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations discover the SMOSI between SnO2 nanoparticles and carbon supports in an order of SnO2/NSC > SnO2/NC > SnO2/SC > SnO2/C. Such SMOSI enables the effective electron transfer from carbon support to SnO2 nanoparticles, strengthening the adsorption of key reaction intermediate of CO2 center dot- and thus promoting CO2RR. With the strongest SMOSI, SnO2/NSC exhibits significantly enhanced selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high faradaic efficiency of 94.4% and an extraordinary partial current density of 56.0 mA.cm(-2) in an H-cell, outperforming the majority of Sn-based catalysts. Notably, SMOSI can simultaneously secure the active sites and thus remarkably enhance their catalytic durability, making it a promising strategy for exploring efficient and stable catalysts for diverse applications.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900009

To this end, we have developed a reaction monitoring platform capable of automated sampling and online HPLC analysis to generate temporal profiles for reactions performed from within a glovebox. The device allows for facile reaction progress analysis to aid in mechanistic studies of air-sensitive chemical transformations. The platform has demonstrated high reproducibility regarding sample mixing, dilution, delivery, and analysis. We employed the sampling platform to acquire temporal profiles for a series of Buchwald-Hartwig aminations. Parallel coupling reactions using iodobenzene and bromobenzene both exhibit complex kinetics. A competition reaction including both aryl halides demonstrated high selectivity for iodobenzene indicative of catalyst monopoly. The temporal profile for the difunctionalized substrate 1,4-iodobromobenzene was unexpected based on our parallel and competition studies and is indicative of a distinct underlying mechanism. We attribute this unanticipated reactivity to intramolecular catalyst transfer through the p system as seen in "living" polymerization transfer catalyst systems. The use of this automated sampling platform has greatly increased mechanistic understanding despite performing only a small number of experiments.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900010

The fundamental mechanisms, however, remain unclear. In this work, via multistate QM/MM theory, we report our discovery that the SAM activation mechanism in the radical SAM enzymes Dph2 and PFL-AE is controlled by the binding structure of SAM to a [4Fe-4S] cluster cofactor. Two distinguishing types of SAM binding structures, different in the orientation of the C-S bond to be cleaved in SAM relative to the SAM-binding iron, led separately to a concerted and a stepwise pathway to form the Omega-type species, a key type of bio-organometallic intermediates captured experimentally for these two enzymes. This theoretically deciphered determinant from Dph2 and PFL-AE for the mechanistic dichotomy enables a prediction of the SAM activation pathway adopted in many other radical SAM enzymes, which opens up an avenue for understanding the SAM activation in the radical SAM enzymes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900011

Such reactions are often diffusion controlled and require multiple catalyst interactions at high dilution. We developed a confined dual-catalytic polymer nanoreactor that enforces catalyst colocalization to enhance reactivity in a fully homogeneous system. The photoredox-catalyzed dimerization of substituted styrenes is disclosed using confined-single-chain polymers bearing triarylpyrylium-based pendants, with pyrene as an electron relay catalyst. Enhanced reactivity with low catalyst loadings was observed compared to monocatalytic polymers with small-molecule additives and analogous small molecules. Our approach realizes a dual-catalytic single-chain polymer that provides enhanced reactivity under confinement, presenting a further approach for diffusion-limited-photoredox catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900012

The activity of all Pt catalysts examined here decreased by water molecules formed during stoichiometric oxidation of ethylene and became stable steadily. A mesoporous silica-supported Pt catalyst improved its steady-state activity after calcination of the support in air at 800 degrees C, whereas no such effect was observed for a nonporous silica support. CO-pulse titration, H2O adsorption measurements, Si-29 MAS NMR, and in situ FTIR along with catalytic activity studies revealed that the activity of the mesoporous silica-supported Pt catalyst is higher than that of nonporous silica-supported ones, despite showing similar hydrophobicity and low Pt dispersion. In situ characterization using CO as a molecular probe indicates that a part of the Pt surface inside hydrophobic mesopores is not involved in the hydrogenbonding network among physisorbed water molecules and surface SiOH groups even after full hydration of the catalyst surface, and bare Pt sites are expected to work more effectively for ethylene oxidation. Such a "hydrophobic Pt surface" can only be formed on a hydrophobic mesoporous silica support, which is probably because of Pt nanoparticles surrounded by a hydrophobic siloxane network entirely. A unique environment derived from the condensed siloxane network and restricted mesopores contributes largely to the high activity of Pt nanoparticles for low-temperature oxidation of trace ethylene.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900013

These protocols rely on a few photocatalysts that can only convert a small portion of visible light (<500 nm) into chemical energy. The high-energy photons that excite the photocatalyst can result in unwanted side reactions. Dyes that absorb a much broader spectrum of light are not applicable because of their short-lived singlet excited states. Here, we describe a self-assembling catalyst system that overcomes this limitation. Immobilization of a nickel catalyst on dye-sensitized titanium dioxide results in a material that catalyzes carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bond formations. The modular approach of dye-sensitized metallaphotocatalysts accesses the entire visible light spectrum and allows tackling selectivity issues resulting from low wavelengths strategically. The concept overcomes current limitations of metallaphotocatalysis by unlocking the potential of dyes that were previously unsuitable.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900014

Although In2O3/Pd have been employed as efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, the electronic effects by strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pd and In2O3 are poorly understood, which is greatly affected by the morphology of In2O3. Herein, we use MIL-68(In) nanorod as a morphological template for the synthesis of hollow In2O3 nanotubes (h-In2O3) and the preparation of supported Pd catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Interestingly, loading Pd on h-In2O3 showed a much higher performance than In2O3 with other morphologies, which exhibited almost unchanged CO2 conversion of 10.5%, methanol selectively of 72.4%, and methanol space-time yield of 0.53 g(MeOH) h(-1) g(cat)(-1) over 100 h on stream at 3 MPa and 295 degrees C. After in-depth characterizations, we found that the different electronic properties of Pd species on In2O3 can be finely tuned by diverse synthetic conditions, which were responsible for high activity and stability. The molar fraction of Pd2+ species in the h-In2O3/Pd catalyst reached 67.6%, 3.2 times that of the In2O3@Pd catalyst (21.3%), due to the different surface chemistry of In2O3. Density function theory results indicated that the Pd donated more electrons to the curved In2O3 (222) surface than the pristine surface, and Pd2+ was critical to facilitate H-2 adsorption and formation of the surface oxygen vacancy. This work demonstrates that controlling the morphology of In2O3 can modify both the Pd electronic property and SMSI between Pd and In2O3, which are the origins of the high catalytic performance.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900015

Further analysis revealed that RGO provided multifunctional contributions to H-2 production from IBS, that is, sufficient area for IBS supporting, efficient photoelectron collection from Cu2O, and effective electron distribution into the cells.

A rhodium catalyst generally used in nitrene chemistry gave amide C-N insertion products and/or the corresponding ketones, whereas a silver catalyst with an achiral bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand provided C-H insertion products.

However, it has been synthetically challenging to create strong interactions between the MoSx catalyst layer and the metallic support material while maintaining high surface area and solution dispersibility for the composite catalyst. In this work, we utilize colloidal ligand-exchange methods to adsorb a single layer of tetrathiometallate complex (MoS42-, WS42-) onto colloidal Au nanoparticles and characterize the influence of the Au support on the electronic and geometric properties of the surface MSx monolayer. Utilizing spectroscopic and computational methods, we show that the Au surface templates cross-linked oligomers of MoSx to generate highly active bridging disulfide moieties and tunes the hydrogen atom binding energies through strong covalent Au-S interactions. These Au@MoS4 nanoparticles are easily incorporated into high surface area electrodes and are able to achieve 100 mA/cm(2) of hydrogen evolution current density at 171 mV of overpotential.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900018

Here, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics and free energy (potential of mean force, PMF) simulations are performed to understand structural and dynamic properties of the reactive state of the SETD3-substrate complex for the methylation process and study the catalytic mechanism of the SETD3 methyltransferase. It is demonstrated that the reactive state for methylation in which His73 adopts the N-delta 1-H pi tautomeric form is stable and His73 is well positioned at the SETD3 active site for accepting the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Moreover, the imidazole ring of His73 in the reactive state has a similar orientation to methylated His73 (His73Me) in the product complex. The results suggest that the imidazole ring of His73 does not undergo rotation during the methyl transfer, and this suggestion is further supported by the results of the PMF simulations for the rotation around the C beta-C-gamma bond in the reactive state as well as classical MD simulations. The free energy simulations are also performed for the methyl transfer from SAM to N-epsilon 2 of the N-delta 1-H pi tautomer of His73 in wild-type SETD3 as well as in Asn255Ala and Tyr312Phe mutants. It is shown that the free energy barrier increases by approximately 2-4 kcal mol(-1) as a result of these mutations, consistent with the experimental observations. The implication for the existence of the stable reactive state for methylation with well-positioned His73 in the SETD3-substrate complex is discussed, and the origin of the increase of the free energy barrier as a result of the mutations is proposed.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900019

Here, we design an efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, coating of WN nanowire core with a Ni(OH)(2) shell supported on a carbon fiber paper (WN-Ni(OH)(2)). In a 1 M KOH solution, the hierarchical electrocatalyst affords a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 170 mV and 100 mA cm(-2) at 245 mV. The enhanced performance of WN-Ni(OH)(2) in the HER is attributed to the synergy between WN and Ni(OH)(2): during water dissociation, hydroxyl groups are preferentially adsorbed on WN and hydrogen on Ni(OH)(2); meanwhile, Ni(OH)(2) could promote hydroxyl group desorption from WN. Thus, the full-surface Volmer reaction kinetics could be enhanced. As a consequence, the WN-Ni(OH)(2) has a reduced activation energy of the HER and enhanced intrinsic activity performance. Meanwhile, the hybrid can reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 339 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and an overpotential of 510 mV for the full water-splitting reaction. This interfacial cooperation offers a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst, as well as a hopeful strategy for fabricating efficient nitride-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900020

In this context, the well-established methods of strong electrostatic adsorption and electroless deposition (ED) have been used to synthesize highly dispersed Ag/Ir on different alumina supports (delta,theta-Al2O3 and gamma-Al2O3). The surface free energy (SFE) of Ag (1302 erg/cm(2)) is much lower than that of Ir (3231 erg/cm(2)); surface thermodynamics dictate the Ir-Ag system should arrange to give the lowest free energy of an Ag layer localized on the Ir surface to minimize the high SFE of Ir. The catalysts remained dispersed at high-temperature annealing treatments (400, 600, and 800 degrees C). For all Ag-Ir/delta,theta-Al2O3 samples, H-2 chemisorption values were higher after annealing at 400 and 600 degrees C than at 200 degrees C and were considerably higher than for the corresponding 1.0 wt % Ir/delta,theta-Al2O3 used as the base catalyst. X-ray diffraction data and scanning transmission electron microscopy images indicate that both monometallic catalysts sintered, but deposition of an Ag shell by ED prevented the sintering of both Ag and Ir. Temperature-programmed desorption of H2 measurements corroborates the high H-2 uptake chemisorption experiments and indicated the additional H-2 capacity was because of more weakly bound H. Computational and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results suggest the excess H-2 chemisorption can be accounted for by binding up to four H atoms to single-surface Ir atoms surrounded by Ag in the shell of the bimetallic catalysts that have been pretreated at temperatures >400 degrees C. As a result, H-2 capacity increases from the normal adsorption stoichiometry of H/Ir = 1:1 up to as high as 4:1.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900022

The bda complex prefers the front-to-front geometry, while the pda complex favors the front-to-back geometry in the formation of prereactive geometry. In the bda complex, the hydrophobic oxo will point at another oxo with the bda directed toward water, which favors the I2M mechanism. In the pda complex, the hydrophobic oxo instead is directed toward a more hydrophobic phenanthroline moiety of the pda of another species, which disfavors I2M. The binding free energy of the nonproductive front-to-back of pda is 3 kcal mol(-1) more stable than that of the prereactive dimer. This incorrect orientation leads to an additional rearrangement required before the O-O bond can be formed. Estimation of the rate constant shows 2 orders of magnitude lower reactivity for the I2M mechanism of the pda complex relative to the bda complex, which makes the water nucleophilic attack mechanism competitive.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900023

Conventionally, such catalysts are constructed by directly embedding a catalytically active acid site into the structure of a porous material, linking the acid properties with the properties of the embedding solid. In this work, a holoenzyme mimicking approach was used, in which a self-assembled hexameric resorcinarene capsule (1.4 nm(3) cavity) acts like an apoenzyme that transforms into a catalytically active site by hosting hydrated HCl as a cofactor. This capsule binds the hydronium ion together with cyclohexanol (CyOH) and catalyzes the dehydration to cyclohexene with enhanced rates that are 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the unconstrained environment. Kinetic analysis shows that cyclohexanol dehydration proceeds via an E2 mechanism on hydrated HCl in the unconstrained environment, while the constrained environment of the active capsule induces the stabilization of an ionic intermediate, allowing an E1 mechanism to dominate. By comparison with the reaction in zeolite environments, we show that the direct chemical environment of the capsule or a zeolite wall exerts only a minor direct influence. The volume constraint increases the reaction rate by inducing a larger activation entropy, indicating the stabilization of a later transition state in the E1 mechanism, as well as a higher reaction space of the carbenium ion constituting the transition state.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900024

For instance, not a single defined enzyme has been described for the reduction of the C = N bond of an oxime, only whole organisms. Such an enzymatic reduction of an oxime may give access to (chiral) amines. By serendipity, we found that the oxime moiety adjacent to a ketone as well as an ester group can be reduced by ene-reductases (ERs) to an intermediate amino group. ERs are well-known enzymes for the reduction of activated alkenes, as of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones. For the specific substrate used here, the amine intermediate spontaneously reacts further to tetrasubstituted pyrazines. This reduction reaction represents an unexpected promiscuous activity of ERs expanding the toolkit of transformations using enzymes.									2	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900025	33251037

Functional nanocarbon materials have been extensively exploited as heterogeneous catalysts to drive catalytic ozonation because of the environmental-benign process, easy applicability, and high efficiency. Nevertheless, the bottlenecks in the processes are the economical production of high-performance and robust carbocatalysts and the debatable oxidation regimes. Different active sites have been suggested in engineered nanocarbons, and the corresponding mechanisms of the carbocatalytic ozonation are ambiguous including the evolution of various ROS, occurrence of radical and nonradical reaction pathways, selectivity toward organics, and tunable oxidation capacity. In this Review, we will showcase the roadmap of the development of reaction-oriented carbocatalysts and clarify the arguments in the mechanisms of the intrinsic active sites, identification of ROS, reaction intermediates, and oxidation pathways in carbocatalytic ozonation. We will provide critical comments and innovative strategies on the mechanistic investigations in carbon-based ozonation from the molecular level (electronic structures) to macroscale (kinetics), by deliberate radical screening/capture techniques, advanced characterizations and in situ analysis, and theoretical computations. More importantly, the critical issues and future directions will be proposed in the rational material/system design, mechanistic exploration, and the implementation of this powerful technology in catalytic oxidation and real wastewater treatment.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900026

Propylene epoxidation using molecular oxygen could replace the tedious current synthesis protocols, which use expensive H2O2 or organic peroxides as oxidants. This review focuses on the propylene epoxidation reaction using molecular oxygen in the gas phase over copper- and silver-based catalysts. Silver is a proven and industrially used ethylene epoxidation catalyst. However, it initiates allylic hydrogen stripping (AHS) in propylene epoxidation, shifting the selectivity toward unwanted acrolein and total oxidation. Nevertheless, silver has been extensively studied to determine if AHS could be mitigated by targeted active site design and various doping strategies. Copper-based catalysts have been less extensively studied but have been experimentally proved as well as theoretically confirmed that their PO selectivity is on par with that of silver. In this review, different catalyst modification strategies have been analyzed and the achieved improvements discussed. Theoretical approaches aimed at understanding the mechanism and predicting catalytic performance on the basis of electronic states (density functional theory calculations) are also reviewed. We conclude with a future outlook on how the current state of the art knowledge of active site modification and reaction engineering approaches could leverage the PO selectivity toward industrial requirements, thus enabling a breakthrough in gas-phase propylene epoxidation using O-2.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900027

This study demonstrates the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity of a Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite (A(n+1)BnO(3n+1), n = 3) as a bifunctional material [i.e., RPLaSr3(Co0.5Fe0.5)(3)O10-delta] for oxygen electrocatalysis via an optimal doping strategy. The improved performance mainly benefits from the enhanced oxygen vacancies, the facile oxygen release and incorporation abilities, the synergistic interplay of Co and Fe together with the increased amounts of adsorbed OH-/O-2, and the highly oxidative O-2(2-)/O-. The more positive onset potential (Eonset) and the highest half wave potential (E-1/2) of RP-LaSr3(Co0.5Fe0.5)(3)O10-delta imply a better ORR activity relative to those of the benchmark Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O2.59 (BSCF) and the widely referred cubic perovskite (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (CP-LSCF). Furthermore, this material enables the electrochemical reduction of O-2 by 4e(-) to OH- with an impressive stability. More importantly, RP-LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-delta shows a largely narrowed potential gap (.E) and achieves its minimum value of 0.91 V, remarkably smaller than those of CP-LSCF (1.01 V), BSCF (1.04 V), and most of the state-of-the-art bifunctional materials. This study paves an attractive way to accurately fabricate RP-type perovskites as highly efficient and stable materials for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900028

Initially, we analyzed the reaction mechanism for the observed hydrolysis at the Asn44-Arg45 site in the hen egg-white lysozyme protein (HEWL) by the Zr-substituted Lindqvist anion [W5O18Zr(H2O)(OH)](3-) (ZrL) using cluster models obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, and metadynamics simulations. The mechanism characterization shows that the overall activity is governed by the energy cost to reach the transition state for C-N bond cleavage from the reactants, resulting in a calculated overall free-energy barrier of 121 kJ mol(-1) that is in excellent agreement with the values derived from the experimental rate constants (113-134 kJ mol(-1)). In addition, QM/MM metadynamics simulations on the early stages of the mechanism revealed the formation of an exergonic non-covalent POM center dot center dot center dot protein complex at the protein surface that was stabilized by positively charged amino acids maintained during the Zr coordination to the amide oxygen. For nonreactive related sites containing Arg (Asn113-Arg114, Arg45-Asn46, and Arg21-Gly22,) we found very similar overall barriers within the cluster model approach (124, 124, and 120 kJ mol(-1), respectively); however, their nonbonding POM center dot center dot center dot protein interactions along the simulated coordination of Zr to the amide oxygen were significantly weaker than those for the reactive Asn44-Arg45 site. Thus, for the HEWL protein the selectivity is governed by an enzyme-like recognition of ZrL at the cleavage site that results in an overall acceleration of the reaction rate compared to those at other sites. Conversely for human serum albumin, (HSA) the observed selectivity was not directed by nonbonding POM center dot center dot center dot protein interactions but instead was controlled by the protein secondary structure. Calculations on several Arg-Leu sites placed in positive patches showed that peptide bonds in an alpha-helix structure have higher overall free-energy barriers, while for the active Arg114=Leu115 site in a random coil region the C-N cleavage is facilitated by the extended conformation of the protein chain. All in all, this study has identified and evaluated two complementary factors controlling the selectivity in peptide hydrolysis promoted by transition metal-substituted POMs; hydrolysis is disfavored at alpha-helical regions of the protein, and then specific positively charged patches can trap the POM via electrostatic-type POM center dot center dot center dot protein interactions and accelerate the reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900030

Yet, limited effort was devoted to understand the effect of ligand coverage and postsynthesis treatments on CO2 reduction, especially under industrially applicable conditions, such as at high currents (>100 mA/cm(2)) using gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) and flow reactors. In this work, Cu-Ag core-shell nanoparticles (11 +/- 2 nm) were prepared with three different surface modes: (i) capped with oleylamine, (ii) capped with monoisopropylamine, and (iii) surfactant-free with a reducing borohydride agent; Cu-Ag (OAm), Cu-Ag (MIPA), and Cu-Ag (NaBH4), respectively. The ligand exchange and removal was evidenced by infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis, whereas high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed their effect on the interparticle distance and nanoparticle rearrangement. Later on, we developed a process-on-substrate method to track these effects on CO2R. Cu-Ag (OAm) gave a lower on-set potential for hydrocarbon production, whereas Cu-Ag (MIPA) and Cu-Ag (NaBH4) promoted syngas production. The electrochemical impedance and surface area analysis on the well-controlled electrodes showed gradual increases in the electrical conductivity and active surface area after each surface treatment. We found that the increasing amount of the triple phase boundaries (the meeting point for the electron-electrolyte-CO2 reactant) affect the required electrode potential and eventually the C+2 (e) over bar/C-2 (e) over bar product ratio. This study highlights the importance of the electron transfer to those active sites affected by the capping agents-particularly on larger substrates that are crucial for their industrial application.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900031

Catalytic hydroboration studies routinely investigated the decomposition of HBcat but in the case of HBpin, decomposition is not commonly considered because of its perceived stability. Organoboranes catalyze the hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes; these species can be formed from the facile decomposition of 1,3,2-dioxaborolanes (e.g., HBcat and HBpin) by nucleophiles and Lewis acids. Similarly, the nucleophilic decomposition of 1,3,2-dioxaborolanes to borohydride species can catalyze the reduction of carbonyl derivatives. These motifs are abundant in hydroboration catalysis; therefore, the potential for hidden boron catalysis is high and must be controlled for. This Perspective discusses the current methods for probing 1,3,2-dioxaborolane decomposition, highlights the need to consider this hidden catalysis in the future development of hydroboration catalysis, and proposes a set of protocols for the identification of hidden boron catalysis.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900032

Given the abundance of their components, large surface area and high laboratory-scale activities, MXenes are promising catalysts and supports for several heterogeneous catalytic and electrocatalytic reactions. This Perspective briefly summarizes the most relevant (electro)catalytic processes where MXenes hold promise as competitive alternatives to traditional Pt-group catalysts. We discuss how the interplay of metal elements with carbon, nitrogen, and various surface terminations modulates the catalytic activity of MXenes. In particular, we analyze the connection between experimental and simulated MXene structures and discuss the differences with bulk carbide extended surfaces. The great advances in synthesis routes and upscaling, in combination with realistic computational models, may give MXenes a leading role in the current quest for efficient catalytic processes.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900033

However, the well-known proximity-dependent selectivity observed in several high-profile experiments is yet to be understood. Here, we reveal that such dependence is closely associated with the kinetics involved. Based on reaction-diffusion dynamics together with kinetic Monte Carlo simulation on a coarse-grained model, one famous example, namely, the proximity-dependent selectivity from carbon dioxide to liquid fuels on a bifunctional catalyst composed of HZSM-5 and In2O3, has been systematically examined. It is found that the diffusion kinetics of the intermediate methanol generated on In2O3 plays a decisive role for the selectivity. For different In2O3/HZSM-5 proximities, the local methanol concentration induces a shift of the dominant process for subsequent methanol-to-hydrocarbon reactions inside HZSM-5, resulting in a preferred reaction window to generate favorable liquid fuels with profound high selectivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of kinetic effects in the design of multifunctional catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900035

In this study, we have engineered a functional and stable self-sufficient chimeric peroxygenase-oxidase fusion. The bifunctional biocatalyst carried a laboratory-evolved version of the fungal peroxygenase fused to an evolved fungal aryl-alcohol oxidase that supplies H2O2 in situ. Enzyme fusion libraries with peptide linkers of different sizes and amino acid compositions were designed, while attached leader sequences favored secretion in yeast. The most promising functional enzyme fusions were characterized biochemically and further tested for the synthesis of dextrorphan, a metabolite of the antitussive drug dextromethorphan. This reaction system was optimized to control the aromatic alcohol transformation rate, and therefore the H2O2 supply, to achieve total turnover numbers of 62,000, the highest value reported for the biocatalytic synthesis of dextrorphan to date. Accordingly, our study opens an avenue for the use of peroxygenase-aryl alcohol oxidase fusions in the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900036

Using an illustrative example and supporting theory, we show that: (i) for small variations in the parameters, global sensitivities are similar to local derivatives; (ii) for larger variations in the parameters (i.e., a larger parameter space), the global sensitivities provide a ranking of importance of parameters and impose a rigorous bound on the errors that arise from fixing one or more parameters to nominal values; and (iii) in general, the global sensitivities can be related to the extrema of local derivatives. We argue that the square root of the total global sensitivity of a parameter, computed by summing the global sensitivity of that parameter acting independently and in combination with others, is a "global" degree of rate control for catalytic systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900037		
J	Hao, Hao; Jin, Baofang; Liu, Wei; Wu, Xiaodong; Yin, Fengfu; Liu, Shuang								Robust Pt@TiOx/TiO2 Catalysts for Hydrocarbon Combustion: Effects of Pt-TiOx Interaction and Sulfates								ACS CATALYSIS				10	22			13543	13548		10.1021/acscatal.0c03984				NOV 20 2020	2020	Developing platinum catalysts highly active for hydrocarbon combustion at low temperatures is crucial but yet challenging, since platinum may convert into inert PtOx in oxidizing atmospheres and deactivates during catalytic combustion. In this article, a Pt@TiOx/TiO2 catalyst with platinum nanoparticles decorated by amorphous TiOx overlayers was synthesized via a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)-related strategy. The Pt-TiOx electronic interaction stabilized reactive Pt-0 sites during reactions, resulting in outstanding activities and high stability for C3H8 and C3H6 combustion. The influences of sulfates-common byproducts forming on catalysts applied for automobile exhaust purification-were studied by monitoring the platinum states, the hydrocarbon adsorption behavior, and the catalytic performance of sulfated Pt@TiOx/TiO2 with in situ DRIFTS. It is suggested that the sulfates promoted C3H8 combustion via heterolytic C-H bond activation on Pt delta+-(SO4)(delta-) couples, while C3H6 combustion was disfavored on the sulfated catalyst because of inhibited O-2 activation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900038

Researchers have recently discovered that a class of cationic Co(II) complexes of the formula [Co-II(PP)(acac)](+) (PP = diphosphine, acac = acetylacetonate) can catalyze hydroformylation with activity approaching that of the widely used rhodium catalysts (Hood, D. M. et al. Science 2020, 367, 542-548). This density functional theory (DFT) study reveals the detailed workings of the cationic Co(II) catalyst system. The precatalyst [Co-II(PP)(acac)](+) is initiated by reacting with H-2 and CO to generate active species [HCoII(CO)(2)(PP)](+). In comparison with the 18-electron neutral Co(I) catalytic species HCoI(CO)(3)(PR3), these cationic Co(II) species, with their unique 17-electron and square pyramidal structure, invoke a lower-energy pathway through different elementary steps such as associative alkene uptake and heterolytic H-2 cleavage. The regioselectivity for linear aldehyde products is due to a combination of electronic and steric effects that favor the anti-Markovnikov insertion of a terminal alkene into the Co-H bond. DFT calculations predict that addition of PMe3 would facilitate the precatalyst initiation, thereby decreasing the reaction temperature or shortening the induction period. The insights gained by this theoretical study can be useful for the further development of hydroformylation catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900040

With a well-defined composition, Pd-M bimetallic catalysts are also the ideal platform for the investigation of the reaction mechanism, which provides a bridge for the construction of high-performance catalyst. This Review intends to give an overview of the recent advances on the design principles of bimetallic Pd based catalyst in term of active sites' structure and number, and provide insights into the synergy effects between Pd and M as well as the supports to understand the elementary mechanisms of reactions. The Review starts with how the intrinsic activity and selectivity of different structures (alloy, core-shell, and Pd/metal compound interface) would be controlled by ligand effect, strain effect, ensemble effect, and support effect; followed by a discussion of the structure determined mechanism investigation in reactions of selective hydrogenation, CO oxidation, methane combustion, electrocatalytic energy conversion (HER, ORR, MOR), CO2 reduction, H-2 production, biomass upgrading, and fine chemical synthesis; and then introduces the strategies for how to maximize the active sites' number in a finite metal load. Finally, the operando insight into the active sites' reconstruction under reaction condition will be discussed. On the basis of this Review, the experience and generic rules acquired from the design thoughts, synthetic disciplines, and the functionalities of bimetallic Pd based catalysts in a given reaction could have an important referential significance for revealing catalytic mechanisms at the molecular scales as well as building up other high-efficiency bimetallic catalysts.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900041

To understand the different oxygenation patterns by members of the long-UPO and short-UPO subfamilies, the latter represented by the Marasmius rotula enzyme (MroUPO), fatty-acid diffusion into their heme pockets was simulated with the adaptive PELE software. Computational results shed light on the inability of AaeUPO to epoxidize oleic acid (C18:1), opposed to MroUPO, due to steric hindrances to harbor (with a good interaction energy) the substrate with the Delta 9 C-10 atom at a catalytically relevant distance (<3.5 angstrom) from the oxo group in simulated heme compound-I. However, effective a-linolenic acid epoxidation is anticipated because the Delta 15 C-16 atom would attain such a distance in AaeUPO thanks to its more terminal position. The above hypothesis was verified using an engineered MroUPO variant (I153F/S156F) with a narrowed heme access channel mimicking that of AaeUPO. Experimental oxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids by this variant thus resembles that of AaeUPO, including regioselective (from 95% to >99%) formation of cis,cis-15,16-epoxyoctadeca-9,12-dienoic acid. The nearly complete conversion of alpha-linolenic acid by the two enzymes was transferred to a small preparative scale, the yield of purified product was estimated, its chemical structure analyzed by NMR, and more interestingly, stereoselective production of the 15(R),16(S) enantiomer (80-83% ee) assessed by chiral HPLC. This enzymatic synthesis overcomes the unspecificity of chemical epoxidation where the reaction cannot be restricted to the formation of monoepoxides as found during m-perchlorobenzoic acid oxidation of a-linolenic acid. Moreover, the variant was able to produce the unsaturated dicarboxylic fatty acid, together with subterminal oxygenation products, during partial conversion of oleic acid. These two noteworthy reactions had not been reported for any UPO described to date.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900042

However, the factors affecting an enzyme's processivity are not fully understood, as processivity in a solid-liquid interface can be hardly determined biochemically. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), here we investigated an insect chitinase cocktail containing one exochitinase (OfChi-h) and two endochitinases (OfChtI and OfChtII), the indispensable enzymes for shedding old cuticle. At the single-molecule level, we have revealed endochitinases as a significant factor to elevate the processivity of OfChi-h from 25 to 176 reactions in crystalline chitin hydrolysis, to dramatically increase the number of OfChi-h newly bound onto a chitin surface area unit per chitinase concentration, and to increase the duration time of processive running OfChi-h molecules on the chitin surface (1/k(off)) from 0.48 to 3.13 s. In the presence of endochitinases, OfChi-h molecules were observed to crowd at the ends of chitin fibrils and form clusters that quickly ablate chitin fibrils. The processive initiation including initial OfChi-h-substrate binding and complexation is a factor that affects processive hydrolysis. The time for processive initiation was deduced to be 0.22 +/- 0.07 s according to an aligning behavior of OfChi-h molecules on chitin fibrils. This work improves our knowledge of exo-endo chitinase synergism during the solid-liquid interfacial catalysis of crystalline chitin hydrolysis, highlighting the role of endochitinases in boosting processive hydrolysis.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900044

Herein, a hierarchical echinus-like Cu-MFI-AE catalyst was developed, which exhibited a high yield of acetaldehyde and unprecedented stability. The formation of Cu-O-Si on the interface of Cu and hierarchical MFI avoids the aggregation of Cu nanoparticles and stabilizes the Cu+ species. The Cu+ and Cu-0 species perform a synergetic mechanism, with Cu+ involving into acetaldehyde generation and Cu-0 serving as H-2 liberation sites. The utilization of interfacial interactions is an effective method in stabilizing metal nanoparticles without affecting the active sites for ethanol conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900046

The product is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of various indole alkaloids, many of which are pharmaceutically important. STRs have relatively broad scopes for both the amine and aldehyde substrates, making them attractive biocatalyst candidates for applications in organic synthesis. An interesting feature of STR discovered recently is the switched enantiopreference of the reaction using short-chain aliphatic aldehydes in comparison to the natural secologanin substrate. Herein, we use quantum chemical calculations to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism and the origins of enantioselectivity of STR, considering both natural and non-natural substrates. The calculated overall barrier is in a good agreement with the measured rate constant, and the nature of the rate-determining step is consistent with kinetic isotope effect experiments. Importantly, the enantioselectivity for the reactions of both natural and non-natural substrates are well reproduced. A systematic analysis of energy profiles of the entire reactions and the geometries of the key transition states and intermediates along the pathways leading to the different enantiomers of the products provides a rationalization for the observed inversion of enantioselectivity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900047

The exploitation of Ni-catalyzed direct homocoupling of unprotected 2-haloaniline analogues to produce 2,2'-diaminobiaryls with a readily available and inexpensive bipyridine ligand has been described. This approach was highlighted by its high chemoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and functional group compatibility. The mechanistic and calculation studies indicated that Ni(0), Ni(I), Ni(II), and Ni(III) species might be involved in the catalytic cycle.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900048

Our time-resolved soft X-ray photoemission spectroscopy results provide evidence of ultrafast timescales and, coupled with theoretical calculations, clarify the mechanism of oxygen activation that is crucial to unraveling the underlying processes for a range of photocatalytic reactions relevant to air purification and self-cleaning surfaces. The reaction takes place between 1.2 and 2.8 (+/- 0.2) ps after irradiation with an ultrashort laser pulse leading to the formation of CO2, prior to which no intermediate species were observed on a picosecond time scale. Our theoretical calculations predict that the presence of intragap unoccupied O-2 levels leads to the formation of a charge-transfer complex. This allows the reaction to be initiated following laser illumination at a photon energy of 1.6 eV (770 nm), taking place via a proposed mechanism involving the direct transfer of electrons from TiO2 to physisorbed O-2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900049

The reaction proceeds by Lewis acid (3 mol % Er(OTf)(3))-catalyzed epoxide isomerization and subsequent cobalt-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation using ammonia borane as the hydrogen source. The general applicability of this methodology is highlighted by the synthesis of 43 alcohols from epoxides. A variety of terminal (23 examples) and 1,2-disubstituted internal epoxides (14 examples) bearing different functional groups are converted to the desired anti-Markovnikov alcohols in excellent selectivity and yields of up to 98%. For selected examples, it is shown that the reaction can be performed on a preparative scale up to 50 mmol. Notably, the isomerization step proceeds via the most stable carbocation. Thus, the regiochemistry is controlled by stereoelectronic effects. As a result, in some cases, rearrangement of the carbon framework is observed when tri- and tetra-substituted epoxides (6 examples) are converted. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions even though aldehydes and ketones are also reduced to the respective alcohols under the reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments were used to investigate the role of the Lewis acid in the reaction. Besides acting as the catalyst for the epoxide isomerization, the Lewis acid was found to facilitate the dehydrogenation of the hydrogen donor, which enhances the rate of the transfer hydrogenation step. These experiments additionally indicate the direct transfer of hydrogen from the amine borane in the reduction step.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900050

In particular, the abundant and nontoxic material hydroxyapatite demonstrates high activity at a low cost when its constituent cations are replaced with transition metals, which also enables its catalytic properties to be tailored. Using this method, the facile and scalable synthesis of a copper-substituted hydroxyapatite catalyst is presented, demonstrating its high activity in the reverse water gas shift reaction. Thorough in situ characterization using X-ray absorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic methods provides unrivaled insight into both the structure of the active catalyst and the speciation of reaction intermediates. It is thus shown that this copper-substituted hydroxyapatite catalyst is an exemplary candidate for use in large-scale carbon dioxide reduction systems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900051

Diverse functionalized carbon radicals (R-F center dot), which are generated through copper(I)-initiated selective halogen atom abstraction via a tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced alpha-amino radical process, undergo regiocontrolled addition to carbon-carbon double bonds. The newly formed carbon radicals combine with Y = CN, N-3, or NCS from TMSY in a copper(I)-promoted process to form a broad spectrum of alpha-cyano-, alpha-azido-, and alpha-thiocyano-beta-substituted products with additional functionalities in R-F in high yields. Conversion of the reaction products to functionalized cyclopropane, amide, amine, triazole, thiol, and tetrazole highlights the potential utility of this method.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900052

We present a thin-film composite electrode with a unique morphology and an ultralow loading of iridium that has extraordinary electrocatalytic properties. This is accomplished by the electrochemical growth of a defined, high-surface-area titanium oxide nanotubular film, followed by the nitridation and effective immobilization of iridium nanoparticles. The applicative relevance of this production process is justified by a high oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) activity and high stability. Enhanced OER performance is due to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). The high durability is achieved by self-passivation of the titanium oxynitride (TiON) surface layer with TiO2, which in addition also effectively embeds the Ir nanoparticles while still keeping them electrically wired. An additional contribution to the enhanced durability comes from the nitrogen atoms, which according to our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reduce the tendency of the Ir nanoparticles to grow. Materials are analyzed by advanced electrochemical characterization techniques. Namely, the entire process of the TiON-Ir electrode's preparation and the electrochemical evaluation can be tracked with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at identical locations. In general, the experimental approach allows for the unique morphological, structural, and compositional insights into the preparation and electrocatalytic performance of thin films, making it useful also outside electrocatalysis applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900053

Herein, we reported the selective production of nitrones under ambient conditions (35 degrees C, 1 atm H-2) via catalytic cascade reactions using supported RuPt nanoparticles (NPs) with finely tuned surface geometric and electronic structures. Under optimized conditions, 94% yield of nitrone was obtained with Ru3Pt1 bimetallic core-shell NPs in the reductive coupling of nitrobenzene and benzaldehyde, while Pt NPs were deactivated after nitrone yield approached 42% and no activity was observed for Ru NPs. The microcalorimetric adsorption measurement and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the strong adsorption of nitrones compared to that of H-2 is the main reason for the deactivation of Pt NPs. The combination of Pt with Ru could increase the surface electronic density of Pt as well as induce Pt isolation by Ru, which, in turn, affects the adsorption strength of nitrone and H-2. Ru3Pt, achieved a high nitrone yield in comparison with other RuPt samples, which is possibly related to the strong adsorption and activation ability toward H-2 and weak adsorption toward nitrone. Our findings open an avenue for a rational design of catalysts for complex cascade reactions via precise tuning of the adsorption strength of reactants and products.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900054

Described herein is an efficient approach for C-H silylation and hydroxymethylation of pyridines and related heterocycles by the combination of silanes or methanol with readily available N-methoxypyridinium ions with a low catalyst loading (2 mol %) under blue light irradiation. The synthetic importance of the developed reactions is demonstrated by the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds.

Electrochemical hydrogenation of TL to MCH can achieve energy savings compared with hydrogenation using molecular hydrogen generated separately, and catalyst development to improve the kinetics of electrochemical TL hydrogenation is imperative. Here, we found that using rhodium to modify Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon black (Pt/C) significantly improved the kinetics of electrochemical TL hydro- genation despite rhodium as a single catalyst being less active than platinum. Rhodium was deposited on Pt NPs by reducing Rh3+ ions with molecular hydrogen. By optimizing the CO-stripping conditions, the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of Pt and Rh for Rh-deposited Pt NP-loaded carbon (Rh-x/Pt/C) catalysts were individually determined, and the Rh coverage (theta(Rh)) and the ratio of ECSA of the deposited Rh to the total ECSA (F-Rh) were successfully estimated. theta(Rh) increased with the Rh/Pt mole ratio for Rh-x/Pt/C and then plateaued around 0.20, whereas F-Rh still increased. According to linear sweep voltammograms and Tafel plots, the Rk/Pt/C electrodes exhibited peak hydrogenation activity 2.7 times that of the Pt/C electrode, and addition of H-ads to TL was rate-determining. Increased theta(Rh) facilitated the addition of H-ads generated on Rh to TL adsorbed on Pt at the extended interface between Rh and Pt, leading to increased geometric reduction current density at 0 V vs RHE (j(geo,0)). Plateauing of theta(Rh) was accompanied by plateauing of j(geo,0), attributed to a lack of any further increase in the extent of the interface. In the electrochemical hydrogen pump hydrogenation of 30 vol % TL with the Rh-x/Pt/C electrodes, MCH was the sole TL hydrogenation product. After the conversion of TL to MCH exceeded about 85%, the hydrogen evolution reaction became appreciable, occurring significantly later than with the Pt/C electrode.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900056

Efficiently exploiting various scaling relations, this approach draws its predictive character from reliable adsorption energies, typically calculated with density-functional theory (DFT). In prevalent screening approaches, the concomitant computational costs are kept tractable through the use of reductionist microkinetic models that only resolve a minimalistic amount of active site motifs at the catalyst surface. Her; we scrutinize this common practice by systematically comparing the screening predictions for the CO methanation reaction when using microkinetic models that resolve an increasing amount of sites, up to the full consideration of all high-symmetry sites at stepped transition metal (TM) and binary TM alloy catalysts. Apart from generally overestimating the catalytic activity, the simplified models fail to identify a most promising class of layered bimetallic alloys as their insufficient representation of the catalyst surface does not allow them to correctly capture the rate-determining step. Only the full microkinetic model provides this proper mechanistic basis for the screening. The excessive amount of predictive-quality adsorption energetics required for this model is obtained from a compressed sensing descriptor that once trained readily provides these data for a new material from a single DFT calculation of the clean surface. With the current methodological advances in areas such as compressed sensing and machine learning, and the concurrent availability of cheap adsorption energetics for a wide range of possible catalyst materials, there is thus no reason to continue to use simplistic microkinetic models in computational catalyst screening.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900057

Transient, high-energy diradical species are typically involved in this type of reaction as key intermediates. Herein, we report the visible-light-induced divergent dearomatization of indole-tethered O-methyl oximes, in which the reactions of the open-shelled singlet diradical intermediates toward competitive [2 + 2] cycloaddition or 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer can be achieved with exclusive selectivity. The mechanism has been well supported by a series of experimental and computational investigations. The dearomatization reactions allow the facile synthesis of structurally appealing indoline-fused azetidines and related polycyclic molecules with high efficiency.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900025

In a large number of these cases, this moiety bears stereochemistry with the stereochemical identity having important consequences on numerous molecular properties, such as the potency of the compound. Yet, the majority of stereoselective syntheses of alpha-CF3 amines rely on diastereoselective couplings with chiral reagents. Concurrent with the rapid expansion of fluorine into pharmaceuticals has been the development of catalytic enantioselective means of preparing alpha-trifluoromethyl amines. In this work, we outline the strategies that have been employed for accessing these enantioenriched amines, including normal polarity approaches and several recent developments in imine umpolung transformations.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900015	34306806

Using multiscale simulation methods, we have characterized the interactions established by a peptidic substrate in the active site, and then we have explored the free energy landscape associated with the acylation and deacylation steps of the proteolysis reaction, characterizing the transition states of the process. Our mechanistic proposals can explain most of the experimental observations made on the highly similar ortholog protease of SARS-CoV. We point to some key interactions that may facilitate the acylation process and thus can be crucial in the design of more specific and efficient inhibitors of the main protease activity. In particular, from our results, the P1' residue can be a key factor to improve the thermodynamics and kinetics of the inhibition process.									27	0	0	0	6	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900017	34192089

Even though the cobalt catalyst is able to activate the C(sp(2))-CN bond alone, the use of the AlMe3 Lewis acid enhances the reactivity of benzonitriles and improves the cross-selectivity with barely any influence on the functional group compatibility. X-ray structure determination of an original low-valent cobalt species combined with catalytic and stoichiometric reactions reveals a catalytically active cobalt(I) species toward the aryl halide partner. On the other hand, experimental insights, including cyclic voltammetry experiments, suggest the involvement of a cobalt complex of a lower oxidation state to activate the benzonitrile derivative. Finally, density functional theory calculations support the proposed mechanistic cycle involving two low-valent cobalt species of different oxidation states to perform the reaction.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900041

However, the current access to enantiopure Ugi's amine is quite tedious and relies heavily on optical resolution, which impedes its practical applications, to some extent. Herein, we present a facile asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched Ugi-type amines bearing a long-carbon chain through Ir-catalyzed cascade allylation/2-aza-Cope rearrangement, followed by amino exchange and Pd/C-catalyzed one-pot hydrogenation/reductive amination. The protocol could be readily scaled up, and it has been conducted in 20-g-scale asymmetric synthesis of (S)-Ugi-type amine from commercially available reagents, in >99% ee and >70% overall yield in four steps with one short silica gel-plug purification. (S,R-p)-PPFA-type and (S,R-p)-Josiphos-type ligands, readily prepared from the achieved Ugi-type amine, exhibited higher or comparable asymmetric induction and catalytic efficacy in several Cu(I)-catalyzed asymmetric reactions, which indicated great potential of the applications of the readily accessible Ugi-type amines in ligand/catalyst design.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900052

The use of a Cu(I) catalyst in combination with a modified 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene (dppbz) ligand enables regioselective hydroboration of various trisubstituted benzylidenecyclobutanes and carbo/heterocyclic analogs. The reaction conditions are mild, and the method tolerates a wide range of medicinally relevant heteroarenes. The protocol can be conveniently conducted on a gram scale, and the tertiary boronic ester products undergo facile diversification into valuable targets. Reaction kinetics and computational studies indicate that the migratory insertion step is turnover-limiting and accelerated by electron-withdrawing groups on the dppbz ligand.

Their cross-coupling for the synthesis of useful isolable ketenimines remains an unsolved challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report a general method for the preparation of ketenimines via a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of easily accessible diazo compounds with isocyanides. The reaction benefits from the use of readily available starting materials, a wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and a high yield in products, and the resultant ketenimines are amenable to further functionalization. Experimental findings and DFT calculations unambiguously corroborate the initial formation of a Pd(II)-isocyanide complex as the active catalytic species, which enables the cross-coupling reaction via a migratory insertion of Pd(II)-carbene into isocyanide, with evidence suggesting that the oxidation state of Pd(II) remains unchanged during the reaction.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900046

However, for enhancing catalytic activity, suitably engineering the LCAs in catalysts through rational design remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrated self-supporting NiO/Co3O4 hybrids for advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Contributed to an abundance of heterointerfaces and increased oxygen vacancies at the interfaces, the numerous LCAs were generated in NiO/Co3O4. Consequently, the NiO/Co3O4 heterostructures exhibited an overpotential of only 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1). By employing density functional theory calculations, it was determined that the d electrons were effectively regulated. Moreover, the d-band centers of Co near the interface in NiO/Co3O4 were far from the Fermi level, thereby confirming the reduction of the unfavorable strong adsorption to oxo intermediates during the OER process. This study provides an effective approach for the rational construction of hybrid interfaces.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900005

Mechanistic studies indicate that the Ni catalyst activates the aryl halide, while the Co cocatalyst activates the alkyl halide. This allows the system to be rationally optimized for a variety of substrate classes by simply modifying the loadings of the Ni and Co catalysts based on the reaction product profile. For example, the coupling of aryl bromides and aryl iodides with alkyl bromides, alkyl iodides, and benzyl chlorides is demonstrated using the same Ni and Co catalysts under similar reaction conditions but with different optimal catalyst loadings in each case. Our system is tolerant of numerous functional groups and is capable of coupling heteroaryl halides, di-ortho-substituted aryl halides, pharmaceutically relevant druglike aryl halides, and a diverse range of alkyl halides. Additionally, the dual catalytic platform facilitates a series of selective one-pot three-component cross-electrophile coupling reactions of bromo(iodo)arenes with two distinct alkyl halides. This demonstrates the unique level of control that the platform provides and enables the rapid generation of molecular complexity. The system can be readily utilized for a wide range of applications as all reaction components are commercially available, the reaction is scalable, and toxic amide-based solvents are not required. It is anticipated that this strategy, as well as the underlying mechanistic framework, will be generalizable to other cross-electrophile coupling reactions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900028	33628617

The characterization results revealed that hydrogen spillover existed in NiMo and CoMo catalysts, and decreasing Ni/Mo and Co/Mo ratios could reduce hydrogen spillover. Meanwhile, the naphthalene hydrocracking behaviors over different catalysts were investigated and compared. The higher yield of cyclane for CoMo/AY catalysts demonstrated that hydrogen spillover could deeply hydrogenate naphthalene into cyclane. The combined catalysts Ni/Y@CoMo/A, Ni/Y@NiMo/A, and Ni/Y@Mo/A showed relatively lower conversions of naphthalene but higher yields of valued <C10 aromatics. The combined catalyst Ni/Y@CoMo/A presented the highest yield of light aromatics due to the appropriate reduction of hydrogen spillover and rational utilization of hydroreaction characteristics for different active metals. Moreover, the stability of the CoMo catalyst was higher than that of the NiMo catalyst. The catalysts containing Co and Mo active metals presented a low content of carbon deposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900001

Iridium in complexes bonded to weak and moderate electron-donor supports, SiO2 and gamma-Al2O3, underwent aggregation, forming nanoparticles and clusters, respectively. When the support was a strong electron-donor (MgO), iridium remained site-isolated. Density functional theory calculations confirm the dependence of iridium-support bond strength on the support's electron-donor character.

The speciation of mono- and polymetallic complexes involving alkylaluminum and the cationizing agent has been achieved. Their dormant or active character has been revealed. This speciation shows a thermodynamically favorable transmetalation reaction between the aryl group of [B(C6F5)(4)](-) and the alkyl group of AlR3. The reactivity of [(2-Me-Ind)(Et)M](+) (M = Gd, Sc) toward monomer insertions is detailed. Computed energy profiles demonstrate the preference for cis-1,4 over trans-1,4 insertion. The influence of the counterion on the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst has been investigated. For Gd-based system, the counterion has an impact on the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst and cannot be omitted in the chemical model. Finally, the ability of these cationic complexes to copolymerize ethylene with butadiene is assessed and compared to neutral and efficient Nd-based catalytic systems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900003

However, the mechanism of product selectivity control is far from being understood. Herein, we studied the role of acidity on the product selectivity by taking SAPO-18 as an example and physically mixing it with ZnCrOx because its Si/Al ratio can be varied in a relatively wide range. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of the product selectivity on the Si/Al ratio. Light olefin selectivity reaches as high as 81.6% with CO conversion 35.5% at Si/Al ratio = 0.011. A higher Si/Al ratio gives a stronger acid strength and higher acid density, which leads to a reduced ratio of olefins/paraffins (O/P) and an increased C-3/C-2 ratio in the products. This could be attributed to the enhanced secondary reactions of ethylene under a H-2-rich atmosphere of syngas conversion. Therefore, it is essential to control the acid strength and density of SAPO-18 in order to achieve selective synthesis of light olefins.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900004

The effect of calcination temperature and Cu loading on Cu-CeO2 catalysts was studied by the combination of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy, H-2-temperature program reduction (H-2-TPR), ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Cu atoms were found to incorporate into the ceria lattice in air at below 500 degrees C, leading to the formation of a bulk CuyCe1-yO2-x solid solution. As the calcination temperature was raised to 800 degrees C, the solubility of Cu ions in bulk ceria was reduced sharply. Surface segregation of Cu atoms led to the formation of CuOx and a surface Cu-doped ceria thin layer, resulting in a much enhanced activity for CO oxidation. Moreover, the activities of calcined Cu-CeO2 catalysts did not increase with the Cu loading but exhibited an optimal activity at similar to 2 wt % of Cu loading, where segregated CuOx species gave an average size in the sub-nanometer (sub-nm) range. Larger CuOx nanoparticles (NPs) on the Cu-doped ceria thin layer exhibited a lower activity toward CO oxidation. We believe the enhanced catalytic properties of the thermally aged Cu-CeO2 catalysts are attributed to the formation of an interface between sub-nm CuOx and the Cu-doped ceria thin layer. Our study thus sheds light on the nature of most active sites on Cu/CeO2 catalysts and facilitates the rational design of ceria-supported metal catalysts for oxidation reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900006

To further enhance its efficiency, both random mutagenesis and structure-guided evolution were performed. Variant M4 (D187N/A200N/S207A/R211G) showed a 43-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m = 1135.0 min(-1) mM(-1)) and a 21-fold reduction in K-m value (0.4 mM) compared with WT. Crystal structures of beneficial variants were resolved to clarify the evolutionary changes underlying improvements to catalytic efficiency. Structure alignment with WT indicated that loop 200-207 may play an important role in modulating access to the substrate entrance tunnel. Furthermore, MD simulations of WT-3a and M4-3a interactions illustrated that M4-3a has a better angle for nucleophilic attack and more readily enters a prereaction state. Additional hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were observed in prereaction states of M4-3a compared with that of WT-3a, consistent with its decreased K-m value. In a hydantoinase process, the complete conversion of 160 mM L-indolylmethylhydantoin was achieved by M4 in a 0.5 L reaction, with D-tryptophan yield of 99.3% and productivity of 64.9 g L-1 d(-1). This study reveals a key loop at the substrate tunnel of D-carbamoylase and provides an effective strategy for engineering D-carbamoylase and other carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family enzymes.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900007

The catalyst is a Cu film sputtered onto the surface of a PTFE membrane, through which the products of CO2 reduction are sampled for analysis by differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS). To avoid changes in the catalyst morphology, the cathode potential is set at -0.8 V vs RHE and -1.15 V vs RHE. We find that the faradaic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) minimizes and that for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) maximizes when the durations at each potential are 10 s. Under these conditions, the FE for the HER decreases to 11%, relative to 22% for static electrolysis, at -1.15 V vs RHE, and the FE for the CO2RR increases to 89%, relative to 78% for static electrolysis. Pulsed electrolysis also increases the FE for C2+ products from 68% for static electrolysis to 81%. Temporal analysis of the products by DEMS reveals that while the variation in product concentrations near the cathode begins in synchrony at the start of pulsed electrolysis, the concentration of C2H4 increases and those of CO and H-2 decrease with extended time. We attribute these trends to an increase in the ratio of adsorbed CO to H on the catalyst surface. Simulation of pulsed electrolysis also shows that during the period when the cathode is at -0.8 V vs RHE, the local concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte near the cathode builds up. This inventory then allows electrolysis during the period at -1.15 V vs RHE to occur with a higher CO2 concentration than could be achieved for static electrolysis. The net effect of alternating cathode potentials is to enhance the local concentration of CO2, which favors the progress of the CO2RR relative to the HER and in particular the formation of C2+ products.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900008

Mechanistic studies showed that the role of Sc(OTf)(3) in the reaction is to activate reagent 1 via Lewis acid-Lewis base interaction to form complex [Sc(OTf)(3)center dot 3(1)], which was fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the reduction potential of complex [Sc(OTf)(3)center dot 3(1)] is much higher than that of reagent 1, thus suggesting complex [Sc(OTf)(3)center dot 3(1)] is much easier to accept electron through single-electron-transfer (SET) process, and consequently, much easier to generate trifluoromethyl radical.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900009

It was observed by postcatalysis solid-state NMR that silica-tethered [(equivalent to SiO-(POCOP)-P-tBu4)Ir(C2H4)] (3-C2H4) was converted fully to [(equivalent to SiO-(POCOP)-P-tBu4)Ir(CO)] (3-CO) at 300 degrees C. In this work, the characterization of species under dehydrogenation reaction conditions far from equilibrium between butane and butenes (approach to equilibrium Q/K-eq = 0.3 at 300 degrees C) is performed with operando Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier-Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to show the kinetics of species conversion from 3-C2H4 to 3-CO. It is further found that [( SiO-(POCOP)-P-tBu4)IrHCl] (3-HCl), a species considered to be a precatalyst for alkane dehydrogenation, is also fully converted to 3-CO. A mechanism of decomposition is proposed that implicates surface silanol groups, while carbon monoxide acts as a "stabilizer" for the catalyst by promoting their reductive elimination and maintaining the complex in the I oxidation state.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900010

The heterogeneous catalytic oxidation route using supported Au as a catalyst in this crucial reaction has attracted considerable attention. However, targeted activation of the secondary O-H bond and satisfactory catalytic efficacy remain considerable challenges. This work reports layered double hydroxide (LDH) supported Au catalysts for the targeted activation of the secondary O-H bond and provides deep insights into the active sites and the roles of the LDH support in glycerol selective oxidation. By virtue of the tailorable chemical composition of the LDH brucite-like layer, Zn2Fe-, Co2Al-, Zn2Al-, Zn2Ga-, and Mg2Al-LDHs, displaying varied surface basic densities and hydroxyl vacancies (V-OH), were applied as supports for Au nanoparticles in this work. A glycerol conversion of 72.9 +/- 0.2% and a dihydroxyacetone selectivity of 63.8 +/- 0.2% were achieved on ZnGa-LDH-supported Au. In addition to Au-0, surface Aun+ (Au+ and Au3+) species are abundant in the interfacial M-II-O-Aun(+) linkages. Detailed investigations verify the cooperation between the surface basic sites on the LDH support for the activation of the secondary O-H bonds and the interfacial M-II-O-Au+ sites for the activation of the secondary C-H bonds. Significantly, on Zn-containing LDHs, an additional synergy exists between the surface VOH sites and the interfacial Zn-II-O-Au3+ species to further promote catalytic activity.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900011

However, the theoretical understanding behind this important class of reactions is still quite limited, and how the presence of low-lying high-spin states benefits their reactivities is not well known. In this work, we have performed a detailed density functional theory (DFT) study on a previously reported iron diimine-catalyzed hydrovinylation, which we have found to exhibit an interesting "two-state reactivity." Specifically, we found that despite the fact that the resting state of the reaction was experimentally determined to be a triplet state previously, the rate-determining and product-determining steps are found to preferably proceed at a singlet state. A triplet state is better at stabilizing the intermediates and imposes fewer geometric constraints for the substrate to adjust its conformations. A singlet state allows an extra available metal d orbital for interaction with ligand, which facilitates oxidative coupling of diene with an incoming alkene, beta-hydride transfer, and ligand substitution. Through in-depth analysis of the electronic structures, we found that the two-state reactivity phenomenon is due to the interplay between orbital interactions, exchange interactions, and coordination geometry, a conclusion that would also serve as an important step in the pursuit of understanding in the first-row transition-metal catalysis and benefit the future design of catalysis with earth-abundant metals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900012

In this study, we have investigated the reaction mechanism of DRM on La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3-derived catalysts and shown how it differs from that on La0.9Sr0.1NiO3. By using isotopically labeled reactants and in situ DRIFTS analysis, we observe that lanthanum oxycarbonates are active intermediates for CO2 activation and oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates from methane on the La0.9Sr0.1NiO3 catalyst, whereas the oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates occurs solely through a MvK-type redox mechanism by support lattice oxygen in La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3. The catalysts were thoroughly characterized by XRD, H-2-TPR, XAS, XPS, O-2- and CO2-TPD-MS, H-2 chemisorption, TGA-DTA, and TEM, and the catalyst properties were correlated with the proposed reaction mechanism. It was observed that in contrast to La0.9Sr0.1NiO3, which almost completely decomposed to form Ni/La2O3-xSrO after H-2 reduction pretreatment, La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 could partially retain a perovskite structure after reduction and in the DRM atmosphere. Detailed characterization of the La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 catalyst after reduction and exposure to reactant gases reveals that this perovskite phase is reversibly decomposed into La2O3 and metal (NiFe) upon exposure to CH4 and is reconstructed upon exposure to CO2 or CH4/CO2 mixture. The cyclic decomposition and formation of the perovskite phase is accompanied by the release and capture of oxygen from and into the perovskite lattice and the redox cycling of Fe between Fe0 (in NiFe alloy) and Fe3+/Fe4+ (in perovskite) states. The La0.9Sr0.1NiO3, on the other hand, forms the lanthanum oxycarbonate phase in CO2 atmosphere, with no observable reconstruction of the perovskite phase. We attribute the reversibility of the formation of the stable La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskite phase under DRM conditions and its high oxygen storage/release capacity as the primary reason for the dominance of the redox mechanism and high coke resistance of La0.9Sr0.1Ni0.5Fe0.5O3.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900013

Catalyst selection plays a critical role in the performance of the RCF process, and noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, and Ru) with a high loading of 5 wt % have been extensively used to obtain high-yield phenolic monomers and delignified holocellulose-rich solids. In this study, we demonstrated that the RCF of biomass over extremely low Pd loaded on N-doped carbon (CNx) support catalysts could produce phenolic monomers at approximately theoretical maximum yield and presented high holocellulose-rich solid recovery. When birch wood was converted over the catalyst with 0.25 wt % Pd loaded on CNx (Pd-0.25/CNx) at 250 degrees C and an initial H-2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 3 h, a lignin-derived phenolic monomer carbon yield and highly delignified holocellulose recovery of 52.7 C % and 84.2 wt %, respectively, were achieved. The Pd-0.25/CNx catalyst contained both ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters and single Pd atoms, which were stabilized on the N-functionalized carbon support. The highly activated hydrogenolysis and double-bond saturation that occurred over the Pd-0.25/CNx catalyst dominantly produced 4-n-propyl guaiacol/syringol. In contrast, 4-n-propanol guaiacol/syringol with residual -OH groups was the major species obtained over the typical 5 wt % Pd/activated carbon catalyst. The plausible reaction pathways for the production of different types of phenolic monomers were discussed using density functional theory calculations. The excellent RCF performance of the Pd-0.25/CNx catalyst was demonstrated using other types of biomass, such as oak, pine, and miscanthus. The successful use of extremely low-Pd-loaded catalysts is advantageous for implementing economically viable RCF techniques.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900014

Therefore, we developed a class of highly regioselective sandwich-type catalysts for the carbonylation of isobutylene oxide. These sterically encumbered complexes install carbon monoxide at the substituted epoxide carbon, generating a high level of contrasteric selectivity (up to >99:1). Further catalyst development improved catalyst solubility and reproducibility while maintaining high regioselectivity. In addition, a dibasic ester solvent extended catalyst lifetimes and suppressed side product formation. This contrasteric carbonylation of isobutylene oxide offers a route to sought-after pivalolactone and, therefore, PPVL.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900016

However, their catalytic efficiency is severely limited by the accompanying hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and fast catalyst deactivation. In order to reveal the origin of these undesired transformations, we study potential reaction routes of HER, catalyst deactivation, and nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR) by density functional theory in combination with microkinetic modeling, using a triphosphino-silyl ligated iron complex as model system. Our results show that the most favorable HER cycle is initiated by H-2 molecules originated from the noncatalytic reaction of acid and reductant reagents, which can coordinate to a vacant binding site of an Fe complex. Thus, H-2 coordination competes with the N-2 coordination step of the desired N2RR catalytic cycle, and the resulting Fe-H-2 complex can be protonated at both hydrogen atoms to release two H-2 molecules. The proposed mechanism, called autocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (aHER), explains all experimentally observed results including catalyst deactivation, as aHER intermediates can be easily converted into thermodynamically stable, catalytically inactive monohydrides. Our results suggest that improved efficacy of synthetic Fe nitrogenases can be achieved by several ways: (i) proper ligand modifications hindering the formation of Fe-H-2 complexes, (ii) suppressing the noncatalytic H-2 formation in the catalytic mixture by different reagent choice, and (iii) using flow or semiflow reactor setup instead of batch reactors and keep the proton and electron reagent excess low.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900018

Herein, atomically dispersed Ni sites have been rationally anchored in nitrogen-doped carbon sheets (Ni-N-4/NC), which could act as an integrated, active, and anticoking catalyst for methanol dehydrogenation with a high selectivity toward hydrogen and CO under 15 h(-1) (weight hourly space velocities, WHSV) in a fixed-bed reactor. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the electronic structures of Ni-N-4 sites promote the desorption of deep dehydrogenation product ethylene to release the Ni active centers, simultaneously giving a remarkably high H-2 yield rate (1800 mol H-2 mol(-1) Ni h(-1)) and a high anticoking performance even under critical conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900019

Here, we adopt the laser ablation in liquid technique to produce Ru nanoparticles (NPs) enriched with grain boundaries (GBs). The as-prepared Ru NPs were then applied as an OER catalyst, achieving an overpotential as low as 202 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, the catalyst demonstrated stability for over 10 h, which is much better than commercial RuO2 (305 mV). EXAFS analysis and DFT calculations revealed that both the remarkably enhanced activity and stability originated from the compressive strain caused by the GBs accumulated in the laser-generated Ru NPs.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900020

Redefinition of the Active Species and the Mechanism of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Gold Oxide								ACS CATALYSIS				10	21			12582	12589		10.1021/acscatal.0c03548				NOV 6 2020	2020	Accurately identifying the active species of catalytic materials and understanding how they catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical for the development of energy storage technologies. In this contribution, we identify two pH-dependent active oxides by mapping the reduction behavior of gold oxide and by in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. It was found that alpha-oxide is preferentially formed in an acidic solution, whereas beta-oxide, Au(OH)(3), is preferably formed in an alkaline solution. In line with the presence of two different surface structures on gold, there are two OER mechanisms: one mechanism wherein water splitting occurs via proton-coupled electron-transfer steps mediated by alpha-oxide and the other mechanism wherein electron transfer and proton transfer are decoupled and mediated by a deprotonated form of Au(OH)(3). This identification of pH-dependent oxides offers a different perspective in our understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides in a full pH scale range.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900021

Mechanistic studies are consistent with a two-step activation mechanism, where oxidation of thioethers to their corresponding sulfide radical cations by an acridinium photoredox catalyst is followed with deprotonation by trifluoroacetate to generate alpha-thio alkyl radicals and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experimental studies support the involvement of TFA in all subsequent steps leading to product formation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900022

However, there have been only a few structural motifs known to efficiently catalyze the acyl-transfer reaction. Herein, we introduce a different acyl-transfer catalytic paradigm based on the tropolone framework. We show that tropolonate salts, due to their strong nucleophilicity and photochemical activity, can promote the coupling reaction between alcohols and carboxylic acid anhydrides or chlorides to give products under thermal or blue light photochemical conditions. Kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations suggest interesting mechanistic insights for reactions promoted by this acyl-transfer catalytic system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900023

A Universal Descriptor for the Screening of Electrode Materials for Multiple-Electron Processes: Beyond the Thermodynamic Overpotential								ACS CATALYSIS				10	21			12607	12617		10.1021/acscatal.0c03865				NOV 6 2020	2020	On the way toward a sustainable energy economy, electrode materials that do not contain scarce noble metals need to be developed. Operating at low computational costs, material screening is a powerful tool to assess the performance of potential electrode compositions by categorizing materials into active and inactive. Most commonly, linear scaling relationships are analyzed by the construction of a volcano plot, in which the thermodynamic overpotential, eta(TD), serves as activity descriptor. Even if this descriptor identifies the majority of active electrode materials, it has been reported that eta(TD) lacks thorough sorting of catalysts according to their activity. This failure is mainly related to the fact that eta(TD) is defined by a single free-energy change (thermodynamics), whereas the applied overpotential and kinetics are not factored in the analysis. Based on the discussion of free-energy diagrams and the rate-determining reaction step, this Viewpoint introduces an alternate activity descriptor, G(max)(eta), for multiple-electron processes, thereby including the applied overpotential and kinetic effects in the evaluation. On the example of the oxygen evolution reaction, the application of G(max)(eta) for the screening and optimization of electrode materials is discussed, providing a different perspective compared with the conventional scheme of eta(TD).									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900024

This increasing level of detail can even result detrimental when drawing conclusions from the computed mechanism, as many coexisting reaction pathways can be in close competence. Here, we present a reaction network-based implementation of the energy span model in the form of a computational code, gTOFfee, capable of dealing with any user-specified reaction network. This approach, compared to microkinetic simulations, enables a much easier, simpler, and straightforward analysis of the performance of any catalytic reaction network.

However, unproductive reactivity from fast deactivation of the photoexcited complexes through back electron transfer has slowed the development of EDA complexes in synthetic methodology. Here, we disclose the study of EDA complexes derived from 2-methoxynaphthalene donor and acylated ethyl isonicotinate N-oxide acceptor that undergo a fast N-O bond fragmentation event upon photoexcitation. This reaction design not only overcomes the limitations of back electron transfer but also enables regeneration of the donor species, representing a rare example of EDA photochemistry in a catalytic regime. The synthetic utility is demonstrated through visible light-driven radical trifluoromethylation and Minisci alkylation reactions. The scalability of the EDA complex-promoted reaction is evidenced by the successful multigram-scale trifluoromethylation of methyl N-Boc pyrrole-2-carboxylate in a continuous flow manifold.									13	1	0	0	3	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900027

However, a universal tool for predicting the activities of these materials is still lacking, thus hindering the efficient discovery of nanomaterials as peroxidase mimics. Here, we use density functional theory calculations to reveal the peroxidase-mimetic mechanisms for a series of iron-oxide nanosurfaces, and we derive a volcano-shaped plot of catalytic activity as a function of simple energy-based descriptors. The activity curves and the descriptors can be used to predict peroxidase-like activities for not only iron oxides but also other nanomaterials that share similar catalytic mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the method developed herein can systematically predict the peroxidase-like activities of nanomaterials and thus is expected to be of use for computer-aided design of nanomaterial-based peroxidase mimics.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900029

In this work, dynamic catalysts are defined in the context and history of forced and passive dynamic chemical systems, with the classification of unique catalyst behaviors based on temporally relevant linear scaling parameters. The conditions leading to the catalytic rate and selectivity enhancement are described as modifying the local electronic or steric environment of the active site to independently accelerate sequential elementary steps of an overall catalytic cycle. These concepts are related to physical systems and devices that stimulate a catalyst using light, vibrations, strain, and electronic manipulations including electrocatalysis, back-gating of catalyst surfaces, and introduction of surface electric fields via solid electrolytes and ferroelectrics. These catalytic stimuli are then compared for the capability to improve catalysis across some of the most important chemical challenges for energy, materials, and sustainability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900030

In spite of recent performance achievements through Pt particle downsizing, knowledge of the prototypical Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst operation mechanism, in particular the electronic state and the stability of the Pt phase under reaction conditions, remains limited. We have investigated atomically dispersed Pt/TiO2 catalysts by pre-/postreaction scanning transmission electron microscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy-mass spectrometry under gas-phase ethanol dehydrogenation conditions under ultraviolet-visible light irradiation. The catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method on two types of commercial titania. While the general effect of the reaction on initially fully oxidized (Pt-IV) single-atom catalysts (SACs) is Pt reduction and aggregation, this combined phenomenon can be inhibited in two manners. First, when it is supported on high-surface-area anatase, the Pt SAC retains an intermediate oxidation state, and its clustering is limited to Pt dimers and trimers. Second, with the same support, a mild reducing pretreatment generates, through the formation of Pt-Ti bonds, near-neutral and ultradispersed Pt species (from single atoms to nanometric clusters) with the highest stability and activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900031

Herein, we synthesized nitrogen-containing nanocarbons (NCNs) with a nitrogen content of 27.6 atom % by a photochemical approach. We found that this NCNs structure can act as a catalyst to drive the reduction of CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO). The CO evolution activity over the NCNs reached 34.5 mu mol/30 min (1 mg NCN) with a selectivity of 80.4%. The quantum efficiency over the NCNs was 2.3% at 450 nm irradiation, which is comparable to those of the metal-based catalysts for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The reaction processes of CO2 reduction were investigated by CO2 adsorption, CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Results suggested that the pyridinic nitrogen sites within NCNs were the main active species for CO2 reduction catalysis. Besides, we observed that nanocarbons with oxygen modification can also drive the CO2 reduction reaction. However, the promotion effect of the nitrogen modification on CO2 reduction was better than that of the oxygen modification on CO2 reduction. Additionally, using this photochemical approach, we synthesized different nanocarbons by changing carbon precursors, highlighting the versatility of this approach. This work expands the application of nanocarbon for photosynthetic CO2 conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900032

Operando monitoring and reliable identification of reacting species, however, are challenging tasks because they require surface-molecular sensitive and specific experiments under reaction conditions and sophisticated theoretical calculations. The lack of molecular insight under operating conditions is largely due to the limited availability of operando tools and to date still hinders a quick technological advancement of electrocatalytic devices. Here, we present a combination of advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations considering implicit solvent contributions and time-resolved electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS) to identify short-lived reaction intermediates during the showcase electro-reduction of Au oxide (AuOx) in sulfuric acid over several tens of seconds. The EC-SER spectra provide evidence for temporary Au-OH formation and for the asynchronous adsorption of (bi)sulfate ions at the surface during the reduction process. Spectral intensity fluctuations indicate an OH/(bi)sulfate turnover period of 4 s. As such, the presented EC-SERS potential jump approach combined with implicit solvent DFT simulations allows us to propose a reaction mechanism and prove that short-lived Au-OH intermediates also play an active role during the AuOx electro-reduction in acidic media, implying their potential relevance also for other electrocatalytic systems operating at low pH, like metal corrosion, the oxidation of CO, HCOOH, and other small organic molecules, and the oxygen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900033	33194302

Within this context, C-N bond activation has emerged recently as a powerful strategy for the preparation or utilization of nitrogen-containing compounds, due to the prevalence of C-N bonds in organic compounds. A key challenge in this area is that most C-N bonds are relatively inert, and this makes their activation a difficult task. Since the turn of the millennium the number of published articles regarding C-N bond activation has grown exponentially, providing important improvements in methodologies for such transformations. Indeed, several distinct strategies have been developed to achieve C-N bond activation. The most common have exploited either strain release or quaternization of the nitrogen center, while other state-of-the-art strategies, such as oxidative addition of neutral C-N bonds and the use of directing groups, have also appeared. Despite considerable progress, deeper insight into the mechanisms of activation and improvements in atom economy are still required for the field to advance. In this Perspective we give an overview of key advances in catalytic methodologies where C-N bond activation is achieved by oxidative addition to transition metals.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900035

However, controlling the coupling selectivity (homo- vs cross-coupling) and the chemo- (C-C vs C-O) and regioselectivity in the reaction of two distinct enolizable substrates under aerobic conditions is notoriously challenging. Here, we present a regiodivergent oxidative cross-coupling reaction between catechols and carbonyl compounds (2-oxindoles and benzofuranones). The oxidative cross-coupling proceeds at the C(6) position of 4-substituted catechols under catalyst-free conditions, while the Pd(II)-BINAP-mu-hydroxo catalyst promotes the reaction at the C(5) position. A series of mechanistic control experiments support a homolytic aromatic substitution mechanism for the carbon-carbon bond-forming processes in both the C(6)- and C(5)selective coupling reactions. Furthermore, computational analyses suggest that Pd(II)-catecholate is a key catalytic active species, which serves as a SOMO-phile, to facilitate the endothermic C(5)-selective carbon-carbon bond formation and the exothermic aerobic oxidative aromatization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900037

Further critical parameters are the limited solubility of CO2 in many electrolytes and its hindered mass transport to the electrodes. Herein we report on a series of nanoparticle Cu electrocatalysts on different carbon supports and their potential to perform the electrochemical CO2 reduction under supercritical conditions (scCO(2)). Herein, CO2 serves as the reaction medium and reactant alike. By a detailed comparison to ambient conditions we show that scCO(2) conditions largely suppress the undesirable hydrogen evolution and favor the production of formic acid by the Cu electrodes. Furthermore, we show that scCO(2) conditions significantly prevent Cu nanoparticle agglomeration during electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900038

These factors include competitive adsorption, molecular structure, and electron polarization of the two ketones on the catalyst surface. Kinetic analysis shows that on MgO, self-condensation of both ACE and CPO is limited by the initial unimolecular enolization step. Accordingly, CPO exhibits a higher self-condensation rate than ACE due to the more favorable alpha-C-H abstraction by the basic O site. The thermodynamic parameters derived from the kinetic analysis indicate that under cross-condensation reaction conditions, the MgO surface fraction covered by CPO is significantly higher than that covered by ACE. Therefore, the product distribution is dominated by [CPO]-activated products ([CPO]CPO + [CPO]ACE). Also, for a given enolate (indicated as [CPO] or [ACE]), the higher surface coverage of CPO leads to enhanced C-C coupling with CPO as the electrophile ([CPO]CPO > [CPO]ACE; [ACE]CPO > [ACE]ACE). By contrast, for both acid catalysts investigated, the rate-limiting step is the bimolecular C-C coupling, with aspects of this step depending on the density of acid sites. That is, on the high-acid-density MCM-41-SO3H catalyst, condensation follows a bimolecular dual-site mechanism (Langmuir-Hinshelwood model). On this catalyst surface, the ACE coverage is higher than that of CPO, which causes a higher selectivity for those products in which ACE is the electrophile ([CPO]ACE > [CPO]CPO; [ACE]ACE > [ACE]CPO). Steric hindrance is another factor that affects selectivity in the same way, favoring products in which the electrophile is ACE since it presents a lower steric hindrance to C-C coupling than CPO. Therefore, the same sequence of products is obtained for the low-acid-density MCM-41-SO3H catalyst, which proceeds on a single-acid site with the other molecule in the liquid phase (Eley-Rideal model). In this case, the electrophile coverage is not relevant, but the steric hindrance is, yielding the same trend as above ([CPO]ACE > [CPO]CPO; [ACE]ACE > [ACE]CPO).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900039

The complexing of exchanged metal ions with H2O or NO, is of particular relevance for a number of reactions, including the ubiquitous presence of both gases in pollution remediation technologies. Here, we interrogate the molecular structure of Pd cations in SSZ-13 zeolites and their interaction with H2O and NO using experimental and computational analyses. Density functional theory (DFT) and spectro-scopic characterization establish that Pd cations preferentially populate two Al (2Al) sites in the six-membered ring as PdII. In situ spectroscopic and kinetic analyses follow the Pd coordination environment and reactivity as a function of environmental conditions, and molecular structures are rationalized through ab initio molecular dynamics and first-principles thermodynamic modeling. Experiment and computational modeling together reveal that, at temperatures <573 K, Pd ions are solvated and mobilized by H2O molecules, promoting catalytic CO oxidation, and form molecular complexes akin to their Pd homogeneous analogues. Exposure to NO promotes transformation from 2Al -> 1Al charge-compensated H2O-solvated Pd-nitrosyl complexes, which desorb NO at higher temperatures and inhibit CO adsorption and oxidation. A comparison with Pd-BEA and Pd-ZSM-5 zeolites demonstrates a heterogeneous distribution of Pd-NO complexes under dry conditions that coalesce into homogeneous H2O-solvated Pd-nitrosyl complexes upon exposure to H2O.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900040

Herein, CO poisoning in CO2 hydrogenation over supported ruthenium (Ru) catalysts in a nonthermal plasma (NTP)-catalysis system was investigated by a combined kinetic and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (DRIFTS-MS) study and compared with the thermal catalytic system. The relevant findings suggest the coexistence of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal mechanisms in the NTP-catalysis. Importantly, comparative study of CO poisoning of the Ru catalyst was performed under the thermal and NTP conditions, showing the advantage of the hybrid NTP-catalysis system over the thermal counterpart to mitigate CO poisoning of the catalyst. Specifically, compared with the CO poisoning in thermal catalysis due to strong CO adsorption and associated metal sintering, in situ DRIFTS-MS analysis revealed that the collisions of reactive plasma-derived species in NTP-catalysis could remove the strongly adsorbed carbon species to recover the active sites for CO2 activation. Thus, the NTP-catalysis was capable of preventing CO poisoning of the Ru catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation. Additionally, under the NTP conditions, the NTP-enabled water-gas shift reaction of CO with H2O (which was produced by CO/CO2 hydrogenation) shifted the equilibrium of CO2 hydrogenation toward CH4 production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900042

Via density functional theory calculations and the computational hydrogen electrode model, we systematically examine the prospect of using a single-transition-metal (TM)-atom-doped graphene-like GaN (g-GaN) monolayer as an electrocatalyst for artificial nitrogen reduction. Among 15 TMs investigated, the Mo-doped g-GaN (Mo@g-GaN) monolayer is the only electrocatalyst predicted to be feasible for the NRR. The Mo@g-GaN monolayer satisfies all screening criteria considered for activating the inert N equivalent to N triple bond effectively, including stabilization of the adsorbed (*) NRR intermediate *NNH and destabilization of the *NH2 species. This monolayer also possesses sufficient overall stability. A complete analysis of the likely mechanisms involved in the NRR on this catalyst suggests that the Mo@g-GaN monolayer could exhibit promising NRR catalytic activity. It achieves this via one specific (distal) pathway, which has a very low onset potential of -0.33 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), corresponding to a low overpotential of 0.42 V vs the RHE, defined using the measured equilibrium potential for NRR of 0.09 V vs the RHE. The potential-determining step, conversion of *NH2 to *NH3, also exhibits a surmountable barrier of 0.42 eV, suggesting kinetics will be facile. Finally, the Mo@g-GaN monolayer is predicted to exhibit substantial selectivity (similar to 31%) toward ammonia synthesis over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings may open a potential route for artificial ammonia synthesis using a single-atom catalyst under ambient conditions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900043

Despite its industrial relevance, the kinetic origin of the high catalytic activity remains under debate. The present report discusses a reaction mechanism of HER on Ni-Mo catalysts by combining experimental and theoretical studies. In contrast to a Ni catalyst, a Ni-Mo catalyst is insensitive to CO gas introduced during HER. In situ spectroscopic measurements including Raman spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) show that Mo3+ prevails during HER catalysis. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations corroborate the thermodynamic stability and HER activity of Mo3+-containing centers on Ni(111) at HER potentials. Notably, Ni is demonstrated to play no direct role as a catalytic site but to effectively disperse and activate the oxidized catalytic Mo species. The results illustrate how to improve the electrocatalytic activity for alkaline HER.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900044

In this work, the prospect for electric field toward controlling product selectivity and reaction networks on the Pt(111) surface was evaluated with periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations in concert with machine learning (ML) algorithms. Linear scaling relationships (LSRs) for adsorption energies of surface species in the electric field were shown to (i) be distinct as compared to zero-field LSRs across metals and (ii) linearly correlate with adsorption energies of H* rather than the binding element. The slope of LSRs linearly correlated with the zero-field dipole moment. A random forest ML additive regression algorithm predicted field-dependent adsorption energies with a mean absolute error (0.09 eV) comparable to DFT. LSRs relating activation energies and reaction energies for dissociation reactions were shown to be distinct as compared to corresponding zero-field Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationships capturing periodic trends. The slopes of the field-dependent LSRs were found to be dependent on the zero-field dipole moment and polarizabilities of the initial, transition, and final states for the reaction. Overall, this study identifies the path forward for electric-field-assisted catalysis, specifically toward catalyst poisoning, product selectivity, and control of reaction pathways.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900045

Steam plays a pivotal role in ZnFe2O4-catalyzed 1-butene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). However, the essential effect of steam on this reaction is still unclear. Herein, we describe the structure-performance relationships of ZnFe2O4 in the presence/absence of steam by combined density functional theory and experimental studies. The catalytic performances of ZnFe2O4 under different reaction conditions were investigated. The ZnFe2O4(110) surface properties under reaction conditions and molecular reaction pathways were modeled. Free-energy profiles were calculated. We found that an oxygen-excess ZnFe2O4(110)-O termination, with an extra O atom bridging two Fe cations, is preferred under oxygen-rich conditions. However, both experimental and theoretical approaches indicate that this surface bicoordinated O is not stable at relatively high temperatures in the absence of steam, resulting in the reduction of surface Fe3+ cations to Fe2+ which are inactive in the 1-butene ODH reaction. It was found that steam interacts strongly with the ZnFe2O4(110)-O surface. Steam stabilizes the catalyst surface Fe3+ ions by converting bicoordinated O to more thermally stable hydroxyl groups. Surface hydroxyls are active sites for C-H bond cleavage in the 1-butene ODH reaction in the presence of steam. We propose that the role of steam elucidated here represents a general mode of steam influence in ODH reactions over oxide surfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900047

Despite the indisputable advances, selectivity issues still remain, given the ubiquity of C-H bonds on molecules; thus, several approaches have been developed to tackle this challenge. Among them, the use of a transient directing group has emerged as an effective tool, circumventing the need for extra synthetic steps to install and then cleave a directing group on the molecule. More recently, this strategy has been successfully applied to the even more challenging transition-metal-catalyzed enantioselective C-H bond functionalization. This review will highlight and discuss the main advances made in the use of a chiral transient directing group for the enantioselective functionalization of C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds by transition-metal catalysis.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900048

Pre-exposure temperature-programmed reaction (PE-TPR) experiments were performed in which ethanol was introduced to oxidized or reduced surfaces followed by heating. In particular, sequential PE-TPR experiments were conducted to incrementally and gradually reduce the surface. The products and their ratios were investigated as a function of surface reduction. The data show that acetaldehyde and ethene production is catalyzed with hydrogen abstraction and oxygen abstraction reactions occurring by intermediates in vacancies at various temperatures >400 K. Adsorption of acetaldehyde followed by a temperature-programmed reaction does not produce ethene, indicating that acetaldehyde is not an intermediate to ethene and that the hydrogen and oxygen abstraction from ethanol to ethene are decoupled steps. Further evidence for this mechanistic nuance was obtained using isotopically labeled ethanol (CD3CH2OH), which produces CD3CHO and CD2CH2. The ratio of aldehyde production to alkene production increases with reduction, suggesting that aldehyde is produced from a disproportionation reaction between ethoxy species in adjacent O-vacancies, while ethene is produced from a dehydrogenation reaction with ethoxy species in vacancies without requiring adjacent O-vacancies. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that the more oxygenated product (aldehyde vs ethene) is favored with more vacancies and that the net alcohol conversion is autocatalytic. Density functional theory calculations were able to find the previously unknown disproportionation pathway between ethoxies in adjacent O-vacancies, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations support this interpretation by reproducing experimental selectivities. The activation energies for these pathways are estimated as 132 +/- 10 kJ/mol for the disproportionation reaction (when occurring between ethoxies in adjacent vacancies) and as 148 +/- 11 kJ/mol for the direct dehydrogenation reaction of an ethoxy in a vacancy. Based on these results, a mechanism with operative pathways based on elementary steps in O-vacancies is reported.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900049

Yet it remains elusive for most of the reactions in a full-size range, from a single atom and subnanometer clusters to nanoparticles. Herein, we report complete size dependence of Pt catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability due to coke formation. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the subnanometer-sized clusters and the nanoparticles, respectively. A canyon-shaped size dependence of the propene selectivity was observed with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size. The subnanometer-sized clusters have opposite size dependence of the propene selectivity compared to nanoparticles. Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles possess high propene selectivity. The atomically dispersed platinum centers with a positive charge dramatically enhanced the activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented its deep dehydrogenation. Besides, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions (e.g., C-C cracking), thus improved propylene selectivity and stability. This work demonstrates the promising application of a supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst for highly selective dehydrogenation of propane.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900050

Density functional theory (DFT) predicts that the formation of bulk PdSO4 is unlikely, which explains the lack of X-ray diffraction (XRD) evidence for the PdSO4 phase. Instead, experimental observations support the idea of PdSO4 being formed on PdO as thin films. Our study found PdSO4(110) and PdSO4(111), corresponding to PdO(100) and PdO(101), respectively, to be the most likely surfaces to be found on a poisoned catalyst. On these sulfate surfaces, PdSO4(111) contains coordinatively unsaturated palladium, which enables catalytic activity. The first C-H dissociation of methane on PdSO4(111) was found to be rather accessible with an energy barrier varying between 0.74 and 0.87 eV, values similar to those reported for metallic Pd. However, the presence of hydroxyl groups increases the barrier height. Methane oxidation is also hindered by an exceptionally strong water adsorption of -1.45 eV on the PdSO4(111) surface, which causes site blocking. A significantly strong adsorption energy causes the combination of surface hydroxyl groups to form adsorbed water that is energetically favorable. The results provide a theoretical justification for the observation that SO2-poisoned PdSO4/Al2O3 catalysts produce proper methane conversion under dry conditions but perform poorly under wet feed.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900051

Herein, by varying the metal loadings of Ru from 0.5 to 4 wt % to regulate the size of Ru on support, the catalytic performances of Ru/TiO2 catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) can be further refined. An improved FTS activity is acquired when metal size increases, while long carbon-chain products (C5+ hydrocarbons) prefer to be generated from the small-sized Ru catalyst. With intensive characterizations, it is indicated that the coating of TiOx on Ru greatly depends on the size of Ru, with the TiOx overlayer being enhanced on small Ru metal particles. This size-dependent metal/support interaction on Ru/TiOx therefore leads to a varied reduction degree of Ru, which possesses an alterable capability toward CHx transformation on Ru. As a result, the small-sized Ru/TiOx catalyst shows a preference toward the chain growth in FTS by suppressing the competitive methanation on Ru/TiOx. Our results demonstrate that the size-dependent metal/support interaction plays an important role on determining the catalytic performance of Ru/TiOx in FTS, and it can be used as an effective method to tune the reactivity of metal nanoparticles in catalytic processes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900054

However, although an important cofactor for the activation of redox enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) suffers from the drawbacks of cost and limited stability. Moreover, the design of an effective NADH regeneration system remains a huge challenge. Here, we report a visible light-driven conjugated microporous polymer DBTS-CMP1 for the heterogeneous photocatalytic regeneration of NADH. Thanks to various improved properties, such as extended visible light absorption, adequate fluorescence lifetime, enhanced wettability, and rapid charge separation and transfer, an NADH regeneration efficiency of 84% in 45 min was achieved with DBTS-CMP1. In addition, the small molecule model compound DBTS-Ph2, which shares similar structural motifs, was also designed to further study the photoinduced electron transfer process. The strong coordination interaction between dibenzo-[b,d]thiophene sulfone and the Rh metal center, as reflected in fluorescence quenching, cyclic voltammetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, plays an essential role in electron transfer from the photocatalyst to the Rh complex, thus endowing DBTS-CMP1 with a high reaction conversion and selectivity (100%) for 1,4-NADH regeneration. Finally, a photobiocatalytic system was constructed by incorporating NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase for the reduction of formaldehyde into methanol. A total amount of 2.23 mM methanol with a turnover number of 2.23 mmol g(-1) was obtained after 95 min in the photobiocatalytic system, indicating the high photostability and biocompatibility of our DBTS-CMP1 photocatalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900055

Prior examples for hydrogenative remote C(sp(3))-H functionalization of olefins via a metal walking process featured external reducing agents. Here, we report a strategy for redox-triggered hydrogenative remote C(sp(3))-H acylation of olefins with primary alcohols both as an acylating agent and a reductant, which is validated by the base-free 1,3-diketone synthesis.

A Mechanistic Study of Polyol Hydrodeoxygenation over a Bifunctional Pt-WOx/TiO2 Catalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	21			12996	13007		10.1021/acscatal.0c03475				NOV 6 2020	2020	In recent years, metal-metal oxide catalysts have proven to be robust catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygenated compounds derived from biorenewable feedstocks to value-added products. Herein, the conversion of 1,2,6-hexanetriol (1,2,6-HT) to 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD) in aqueous media over a Pt-WOx/TiO2 catalyst is examined via isotope incorporation in HDO of a model compound, 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PD). Absence of a primary kinetic isotope effect (k(H)/k(D) = 0.84 +/- 0.11) disproves a potential direct C-O bond scission mechanism. The observation of nearly complete deuterium incorporation in both the alpha-C and the beta-C is inconsistent with the reverse Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and suggests an enol formation pathway. Evidence consistent with the intermediacy of an oxocarbenium ion as a minor contributor has also been observed. In drawing the conclusions, it was necessary to characterize the facile isotope exchange between surface activated hydrogen and the water solvent. Hydrogenation of a water-soluble olefin, tetra(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (TEGDA) in H-2/D2O revealed predominant incorporation of deuterium instead of hydrogen in the reduced product, confirming the rapid exchange of surface activated hydrogen. The methods used in this study provide clarification about a reaction mechanism currently under debate, and these findings can be applied to other systems involving HDO of linear polyols over metal-metal oxide catalysts, improving catalyst design and utilization of sustainable feedstocks.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900057

In this study, SiO2 is deposited over the active sites of a macroporous, highly dispersed Ti-SiO2 catalyst, with or without an organic template. SiO2 deposition is shown to impact the local environment around epoxidation active sites without altering the active site or introducing diffusion limitations for the representative bulky alkene limonene. Thus, intrinsic activation enthalpies remain nearly constant (45 +/- 3 kJ/mol) across all materials and controls, but templated SiO2 deposition gives an apparent activation enthalpy (9 kJ/mol) much lower than that of the other materials tested because of its strong limonene adsorption. This demonstrates independent control of the active site, its immediate surroundings, and the extended pore structure, while also serving the practical purpose of creating a material that can outperform relevant benchmark materials. These types of materials may find utility in the selective transformation of larger reactants, including biorenewables such as limonene, or precursors for pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900058

This work explores the impact of cation-tunable hemilability on the speciation of iridium(III) pincer-crown ether catalysts during high-activity olefin isomerization. Under conditions where strong cation-macrocycle interactions are fostered and terminal olefin has been consumed, labilization of the aza-crown ether group leads to an eta(6)-arene complex, wherein the pincer ligand is metallated at a different position. Arene complexes of styrene, naphthalene, and mesitylene were independently synthesized and found to exhibit diminished catalytic activity for allylbenzene isomerization. In response to these findings, a previously unreported catalyst bearing a synthetically modified pincer ligand was designed, resulting in a refined system that maintains high activity even when arene complexes are formed.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900059

In a conventional process to accelerate the water oxidation, oxygen evolution cocatalysts (OECs) are usually used on the surface of a photoanode. As an alternative strategy, we considered employing a composite photoanode made up of a semiconductor and carbon spheres, for it is expected that the photogenerated electrons on the semiconductor particles can be captured by the carbon spheres as electron reservoirs and leave the photogenerated holes on the surface of the semiconductor particles, which promotes the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. More importantly, the holes accumulated in the valence band accelerate the water oxidation reaction rate with the rapid release of electrons stored on the carbon sphere. Therefore, the composite photoanode achieves a higher photocurrent at a lower applied bias. We provide a proof of concept for this strategy by preparing a composite photoanode by combining bismuth vanadium oxide BiVO4 with carbon spheres and find that the resulting photoanode displays a remarkable enhancement in the rate of the photoanode water oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900060

By comparison, only few studies address the degradation mechanism(s) of fuel cell catalysts in alkaline media. In this work, we investigate the stability of four different types of Pt/C fuel cell catalysts upon applying accelerated degradation tests in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setup equipped with an anion exchange membrane. In contrast to previous investigations exposing the catalysts to a liquid electrolyte, the GDE setup provides a realistic three-phase boundary of the reactant gas, catalyst, and ionomer which enables reactant transport rates close to real fuel cells. Therefore, the GDE setup mimics the degradation of the catalyst under more realistic reaction conditions as compared to conventional electrochemical cells. Combining the determination of the loss in the electrochemically active surface area of the Pt/C catalysts via CO stripping measurements with the change in particle size distribution determined by small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, we demonstrate that (i) the degradation mechanism depends on the investigated Pt/C catalyst and might indeed be different from the one observed in conventional electrochemical cells, (ii) degradation is increased in an oxygen gas atmosphere (as compared to an inert atmosphere), and (iii) the observed degradation mechanism depends on the mesoscopic environment of the active phase. The measurements indicate an increased particle growth if small and large particles are immobilized next to each other on the same carbon support flakes as compared to a simple mix of two catalysts with small and large particles, respectively.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900061

We describe a two-step multienzymatic reduction of a series of alpha-halo beta-alkyl tetrasubstituted cyclic enones, affording halohydrins with three contiguous stereogenic centers, in good yield and with a high stereoselectivity. The reduction is catalyzed by a stereospecific ene-reductase (OYE2-3 or NemA) and a highly enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The use of two enantiodivergent ADHs allows the control of the diastereoselectivity. The absolute stereochemical configurations of the products have been determined from the analysis of single-crystal structures (Flack's parameter). The enantiomeric excess (ee) has been determined by derivatization of the products with (R) Mosher's acid. Lastly, we extended our methodology also to a nonhalogenated substrate: the alpha-methyl ketoisophorone was reduced by two distinct enantiodivergent ene-reductases (flavin mononucleotide- and F420-dependent), affording each enantiomer of the saturated ketone with ee > 98%.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900062

Traditional CO2 capture methods employ temperature or pressure swings; however, electrochemical swings, in which an applied potential modulates nucleophilicity, are also possible to mediate the capture and release of CO2. In contrast to the breadth of electrochemical CO2 reduction research, electrochemically mediated CO2 capture and concentration is an emerging field. Although some aspects are reminiscent of those in CO2 reduction, like local pH gradients and (bi)carbonate equilibria, ultimately electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration poses its own unique challenges that will benefit from insights from intercalative batteries, redox flow batteries, and biomimetic/-inspired design, among other fields. After an introduction to carbon capture and current chemical strategies, this Review highlights promising emerging electrochemical methods to enable CO2 capture and concentration; specifically discussed are organic redox, transition metal redox, and pH swings. It closes with an outlook and discussion of future research challenges for electrochemically mediated capture.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900063

Their active site, the H-cluster, is composed of a [4Fe-4S] subcluster ([4Fe-4S](H)) covalently attached to a [2Fe] subcluster ([2Fe](H)). The two subclusters are strongly redox-coupled, and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) within the H-cluster is thought to be essential for catalytic activity. Additionally, proton-coupled reduction of [4Fe-4S](H) has been proposed. Here, we investigated the pH dependence of the redox behavior of [4Fe-4S](H) using infrared (IR) spectroelectrochemistry with two different [FeFe] hydrogenases: CrHydA1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and CpHydA1 from Clostridium pasteurianum. Contrary to previous reports, we find that, under our experimental conditions, the redox potential of [4Fe4S](H) is independent of pH around physiological values for both enzymes. We also found redox anticooperativity behavior between [4Fe-4S](H) and the accessory [4Fe-4S] clusters (F-clusters) in CpHydA1, which tunes catalysis at the active site. Taken together, these results indicate that the catalytic cycle of [FeFe] hydrogenases likely does not involve protonation at or near [4Fe-4S](H), and instead, favors a model in which protonation of [2Fe](H) drives catalysis. Our findings shed new light on the catalytic mechanism of [FeFe] hydrogenases and highlight the importance of the F-clusters in fine-tuning catalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900065

However, the insufficient long-term stability of these technologies precludes their commercial deployment. The structural deterioration of the catalyst material is one possible source of device durability issues. Unfortunately, this issue has been insufficiently studied in systems using actual technical electrodes. Herein, we make use of a morphologically tailored Ag-based model nanocatalyst [Ag nanocubes (NCs)] assembled on a zero-gap GDE electrolyzer to establish correlations between catalyst structures, experimental environments, electrocatalytic performances, and morphological degradation mechanisms in highly alkaline media. The morphological evolution of the Ag-NCs on the GDEs induced by the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR), as well as the direct mechanical contact between the catalyst layer and anion-exchange membrane, is analyzed by identical location and post-electrolysis scanning electron microscopy investigations. We find that at low and mild potentials positive of -1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl, the Ag-NCs undergo no apparent morphological alteration induced by the CO2RR, and the device performance remains stable. At more stringent cathodic conditions, device failure commences within minutes, and catalyst corrosion leads to slightly truncated cube morphologies and the appearance of smaller Ag nanoparticles. However, comparison with complementary CO2RR experiments performed in H-cell configurations in a neutral environment clearly proves that the system failure typically encountered in the gas-fed approaches does not stem solely from the catalyst morphological degradation. Instead, the observed CO2RR performance deterioration is mainly due to the local high alkalinity that inevitably develops at high current densities in the zero-gap approach and leads to the massive precipitation of carbonates which is not observed in the aqueous environment (H-cell configuration).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900066

A series of well-designed experiments including various isotopic experiments revealed that an acid-base pair catalysis was involved, that is, DCM mainly dissociated on Lewis acid sites and then dehydrochlorinated through hydroxyl groups/Bronsted acid sites, while the basicity was intrinsic to the generation of MCM via a hydride transfer reaction between DCM activated on basic sites and DCM dissociated on Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the superior redox ability could suppress the formation of MCM by a rapid catalytic oxidation but prompt the possible formation of Cl-2 and polychlorinated byproducts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900067

Herein, we present an engineered architecture for supported iridium catalysts, which enables decreased precious metal content and improved activity and conductivity. The improvement in performance at lower precious metal loading is realized by the deposition of a conformal layer of platinum nanoparticles on titanium dioxide (TiO2) using a facile photoreduction method to prepare conductive layer coated supports (CCSs). Platinum nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on TiO2, and the conductivity of the subsequent catalysts with 39 wt % precious group metal loadings is significantly higher than the commercial 75 wt % loaded IrO2-TiO2 catalysts. The conformal conductive layer also maintains an enhanced conductivity and electrochemical activity upon thermal annealing when compared to catalysts without the conductive layer and nonconformal heterogeneous conductive layer. The iridium mass activity from half-cell studies shows a 141% improvement for CCS supported catalysts at 42% lower loadings compared to the commercial catalysts. The conductive layer also improves the single cell electrolyzer performance at a similar catalyst loading in comparison to a commercial state-of-the-art catalyst. We correlate the physical properties of the engineered catalysts with their electrochemical performance in electrolyzers to understand structure-activity relationships, and we anticipate further performance improvements upon synthesis and materials optimizations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900068

Synthetic iron porphyrin model complexes mimicking the active site of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) are shown to enhance the rate of ORR and 4H(+)/4e(-) selectivity irrespective of the rate of electron transfer from the electrode relative to unfunctionalized iron porphyrins. In operando spectroscopic analysis over self-assembled monolayer-modified electrodes allows characterization of reactive intermediates involved in ORR. Two key intermediate species of ORR, Fe-III-OOH and Fe-IV=O, are identified using O-18(2) labeling depending on the nature of the pendant residue of these HRP mimics. The results indicate that the nature of the pendant distal moiety in the distal superstructure of iron porphyrin changes the distribution of the intermediate species under steady state relative to simple mononuclear porphyrins. Density functional theory calculations indicate that not only the presence of hydrogen bonding from the pendant groups but also its relative spatial orientation with respect to the proximal and distal oxygen atom of a Fe-III-OOH intermediate species controls the selectivity of ORR.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900069

Hybrid bilayer membranes (HBMs), comprising a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) covered by a lipid membrane, have been developed recently to regulate the performance of HBM-embedded electrocatalysts. A major technological roadblock in HBM development is the inability to facilitate proton transfer under alkaline conditions where nonprecious metal (NPM) catalysts can rival the performance of their precious metal counterparts. Here, we synthesized proton carriers bearing nitrile groups found in protonophores. These bioinspired proton carriers can facilitate transmembrane proton delivery to an HBM-supported Cu oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst under alkaline conditions. Our stimuli-responsive proton regulators can turn on the activity of the ORR catalyst on-demand, thereby opening doors to investigate how proton transfer kinetics govern the performance of electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900070

Nevertheless, general synthetic access remains out of reach. Herein, we describe a simple and robust cis-selective hydrogenation of abundant and cheap fluoropyridines to yield a broad scope of (multi)fluorinated piperidines. This protocol enables the chemoselective reduction of fluoropyridines while tolerating other (hetero)-aromatic systems using a commercially available heterogenous catalyst. Fluorinated derivatives of important drug compounds are prepared, and a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched fluorinated piperidines is disclosed.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200032	33859866

We report herein a copper-catalyzed chemo-, regio-, and enantioselective cyanoborylation of allenes, which afforded a family of valuable enantiopure beta-boryl allyl nitriles. The high enantioselectivity was achieved by installing of appropriate substituents at the C2 and C6 positions of the naphthyl groups in our newly synthesized N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. The reaction mechanism has been clarified by some stoichiometric reactions and computational studies. This work provides an inspiring example of the development of selective catalytic reactions for the synthesis of functional molecules through fine-tuning the ligands in catalysis.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200001

The modularity of our approach is shown by the introduction of several silyl- and alkyl-based protecting groups. To highlight functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity, we demonstrate the functionalization of a variety of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic aldehydes, even in the presence of ketones and esters. Mechanistic studies support a radical mechanism, starting from the single electron oxidation of the enol ether.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200015

This transformation is suitable for various directing groups with H-2 as the only byproduct, which warrants a high atom economy and practical oxidative C-C bond formation under mild conditions.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200002

However, their utility in synthesis has been limited, as their generation required unstable, reactive starting materials and harsh reaction conditions. Visible-light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a platform for the mild production of aminium radical cations from either unfunctionalized or N-functionalized amines. This Perspective covers recent synthetic methods that rely on the photocatalytic generation of aminium radical cations for C-N bond formation, specifically in the context of alkene hydroamination, arene C-H bond amination, and the mesolytic bond cleavage of alkoxyamines.									18	0	0	0	6	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200004	33163257

Herein, transition metal (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) doping was used to introduce oxygen vacancies in CeO2 and promote activity for carbonyl sulfide (COS) hydrolysis. Various techniques were performed to accurately characterize the catalyst structure and state. The transition metals successfully entered the crystal lattice of CeO2 and formed a solid solution structure. The metal-doped CeO2 (M/CeO2) showed improved reduction properties, more Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies in comparison with pure CeO2. The introduction of transition metal greatly enhanced activity of M/CeO2 for COS hydrolysis. Among them, the Co/CeO2 sample displayed the highest activity and H2S selectivity. The roles of metal doping in improving activity were explored on the basis of DFT calculations. The strong interaction between doped metals and CeO2 promotes the spontaneous formation of asymmetric oxygen vacancies in M/CeO2. These asymmetric oxygen vacancies facilitate the activation and dissociation of H2O and generation of active hydroxyls, which contributes to the enhanced activity for COS hydrolysis. This work provides an attractive method for obtaining nonprecious metal catalysts for COS hydrolysis.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200005

Here, we report that the surface electronic structure of ruthenium (Ru) can be effectively modulated through phosphorus (P) doping to produce significantly enhanced catalytic HOR and HER performance in alkaline electrolyte. By controlling the amount of P, the resulted P-Ru/C exhibits outstanding catalytic activity, achieving a normalized exchange current density of 0.72 mA cm(-2) and mass activity of 0.43 mA mu g(-1), approximately 5 and 3.5 times higher than those of Ru/C, respectively, and even 2 times higher than that of Pt/C (commercial 20 wt %) for HOR. Moreover, sixfold enhancement compared with Ru/C in the HER can be achieved from P-Ru/C. Experimental and density functional theory results indicate that electronic manipulation through P-doping is beneficial to the prominent HOR/HER performance and enhanced kinetics.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200006

The catalytic activities of conventional dual-catalytic systems, however, are limited by the low synergistic efficiency between discrete catalytic centers due to their long average distance in solution. Herein we carefully decorated Ir(III) photosensitizers and Ni(II) transition-metal catalyst into flexible polymers to afford two polymer-supported dual catalysts (P1-Ni and P2-Ni). These polyelectrolyte-type metallopolymers assembled into spherical polymer particles in some polar solvents. Their unique molecular and assembled structure contributed to shortening the distance between catalytic centers and increasing the local catalysts' concentration within the catalyst, thereby greatly facilitating their electron, energy, and organic radical transfers during the catalytic cycles. The enhanced energy interaction and matched redox potential between two catalytic centers within the polymer were confirmed by steady- and transient-state luminescent spectra and cyclic voltammetry. These features enable them in catalyzing challenging organic transformations that involve efficiently incorporated photocatalytic and transition-metal catalytic cycles. We demonstrated that these two catalysts were highly effective in catalyzing C-S cross-coupling, C-O functionalized, C-N cross-coupling, and C-C cross-coupling reactions with broad substrate scopes and low catalyst loadings with turnover numbers of similar to 3100, similar to 1500, similar to 1400, and similar to 500, respectively. This work provides a general methodology to merge photosensitizer and transition-metal catalyst in a flexible polymer for significantly boosting the catalytic activity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200007

NiFeOx catalysts were grown on both Au(111) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrodes. DFT predicted Fe edge-site atoms at the NiFeOx/Au(111) interface to be the most thermodynamically favorable reaction center, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data indicated small NiFeOx catalyst particles on Au(111) contained a high population of OER active Fe edge-site atoms. However, restructuring of the Au(111) surface due to repeated oxidation and reduction cycles of the OER CV measurements encapsulated small NiFeOx nanoparticles at catalyst loadings below similar to 1.5 nmolmetal/cm(2), passivated catalyst edges and reduced bulk OER activity of Au-supported NiFeOx compared with HOPG-supported ones. Analysis of intrinsic activity revealed that the Au(111) support strongly benefited electrochemically accessible NiFeOx atoms, and we observed a 2-3 fold activity enhancement compared with HOPG-supported catalysts for loadings above similar to 1 nmolmetal/cm(2). Evaluating bulk vs intrinsic activity and identifying loading/coverage-dependent support effects is important for accurately probing fundamental interfacial chemistry, choosing suitable catalyst loadings and supports, and optimizing system parameters to maximize the performance of electrocatalyst systems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200008

The artificial metalloenzyme could be specialized for one of these catalytic reactions introducing a single mutation in the protein.

Using the crystal structure of human NAAA as a starting point, we investigated the catalytic mechanism of PEA hydrolysis with a multiscale approach based on classic molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations coupled with enhanced sampling and path-collective variables (PCVs). The proton configuration of the catalytic nucleophile, Cys126, and of the surrounding carboxylates was critical to preserve the active site architecture. A stable Michaelis complex was then used to reconstruct the free-energy surfaces of NAAA acylation and deacylation during PEA hydrolysis. Acylation emerged as the critical step, with Cys126 acting both as an acid, to protonate the ethanolamine leaving group, and as a nucleophile, to attack the PEA carbonyl carbon. The ethanol fragment of PEA did not appear to play an indispensable role in acylation, a result further supported by kinetic experiments showing that NAAA hydrolyzes palmitoyl methyl amide (PMA) with high catalytic efficiency. Our multiscale approach identified a distinctive protonation state and catalytic mechanism for NAAA which accounts for pH-dependent activity, mutagenesis data, and mechanism of covalent inhibitors.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200012

We address this inherent complexity by extending computational materials screening over a diverse set of such sites. For the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at molybdenum carbides, extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations for key reaction intermediates at these sites show that differing adsorption modes break many of the scaling relations known to hold across transition metals. Despite the resulting inherently rich reduction chemistry, clear trends emerge. Notably, this includes a product selectivity governed by the metal/carbon ratio of the active site. The trend toward methanol formation for C-containing active sites mirrors thermal heterogeneous CO2 activation and suggests a shift of focus toward more C-rich carbides for CO2RR to methanol.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200013

Significant insight into heterogeneous systems has been gained over the years through the synthesis, characterization, and application of well-defined surface organometallic catalysts, predominantly supported on silica and alumina. Considerable research efforts have focused on the application of homogeneous methods to the synthesis and characterization of these systems. Homogeneous catalysis has thrived on its ability to electronically and sterically tune ligands to yield desired reactivity and selectivity. Efforts in SOMC, however, have only recently turned to harnessing the stereoelectronic diversity of potential inorganic support materials beyond silica and alumina in order to exert similar control on the reactivity of the organometallic active site. The support material is intrinsically linked to electronic structure and reactivity of heterogeneous organometallic systems in the same way that ligands exert control over homogeneous catalyst systems. The ability to tune the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts by changing the support is of great value, and it is anticipated that this will represent an area of significant growth in the field. In this Perspective, the use and future of nontraditional catalyst supports, such as sulfated metal oxides, modified silicas, and redox active supports are discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200014

We report herein a variety of ionic liquid-grafted UiO-66 solid superacids synthesized from quaternization of UiO-66 with 1,3-propane sultone, ion-exchanging with H2SO4 or HSO3CF3. The developed UiO-66 solid superacids are highly efficient in catalyzing biodiesel production toward transesterification, which were better than the ionic liquid and neat H2SO4. The remarkable activities found in the UiO-66 solid superacids benefit from the synergistic effect of high acid concentrations (similar to 3.33 mmol/g), superacidity (determined by P-31 solid-state NMR, Hammett indicators, and potentiometric titration), as well as unique shape-selective confinement for methanol into the ordered and uniform micropores, which targeted the activation of methanol to prevent the occurring of an inverse reaction in the reactions. The UiO-66 solid superacids show important application potentials in the area of biodiesel production in the industry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200016

Herein, we report a systematic study on the ligand topology structure and catalytic activity in the asymmetric epoxidation of olefin with manganese complexes bearing different aryl-substituted mcp ligands (mcp = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine). In particular, a class of quasitrans topology manganese complexes bearing 4-tert-Bu-phenyl-substituted mcp ligands are prepared and characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The quasitrans topology manganese complexes undergo efficient olefin epoxidation with H2O2 as the oxidant in the presence of carboxylic acid or sulfuric acid. In addition, the mechanism of activation of H2O2 by these complexes is discussed based on density functional theory calculations.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200017

However, despite the remarkable specific activities of photobiocatalysts, self-shading at moderate-high cell densities limits efficient space-time-yields of heterologous enzymatic reactions. Moreover, efficient integration of an artificial electron sink into the tightly regulated network of cyanobacterial electron pathways can be highly challenging. Here, we used C=C bond reduction of 2-methylmaleimide by the NADPH-dependent ene-reductase YqjM as a model reaction for light-dependent biotransformations. Time-resolved NADPH fluorescence spectroscopy allowed direct monitoring of in-cell YqjM activity and revealed differences in NADPH steady-state levels and oxidation kinetics between different genetic constructs. This effect correlates with specific activities of whole-cells, which demonstrated conversions of >99%. Further channelling of electrons toward heterologous YqjM by inactivation of the flavodiiron proteins (Flv1/Flv3) led to a 2-fold improvement in specific activity at moderate cell densities, thereby elucidating the possibility of accelerating light-driven biotransformations by the removal of natural competing electron sinks. In the best case, an initial product formation rate of 18.3 mmol h(-1) L-1 was reached, allowing the complete conversion of a 60 mM substrate solution within 4 h.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200018	33101760

Here, we present an approach for designing an efficient ZSM-5-based catalyst for the selective cracking of butenes to propene by properly balancing diffusional and compositional effects. Instead of the large coffin-shaped ZSM-5 crystallites with very high Si/Al ratios generally reported, the optimal catalyst in terms of propene selectivity and catalyst life was found to be a ZSM-5 zeolite with a squared morphology, submicron-sized crystals (0.8 x 0.3 x 1.0 mu m), and a Si/Al molar ratio of around 300. For this crystal conformation, the short dimensions of both sinusoidal and straight channels facilitate propene diffusion and reduce its consumption in consecutive reactions, limiting the formation of C5+ oligomers and aromatics and maximizing propene selectivity. Coffin-type ZSM-5 crystals, with higher diffusional restrictions than square-shaped crystals, show faster catalyst deactivation than the latter, independently of the crystal size and Al content. However, among the ZSM-5 zeolite crystallites with a coffin morphology, the one presenting intergrowths on the (010) face, with a larger proportion of sinusoidal channels, shows a lower aromatic selectivity and deactivation rate, whereas the other two, with straight channels open to the clean (010) faces, favor the formation of aromatics by direct cyclization-dehydrogenation of oligomeric intermediates.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200019

Despite being an affordable and very promising catalyst for CO-PrOx, the CO oxidation activity, selectivity, and phase stability of cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4) may be affected by the other gas feed components, viz., H-2, H2O, and CO2. However, the influence of these gases (individually and collectively) during CO-PrOx is still not understood. In the current study, in situ powder X-ray diffraction and magnetometry were used to systematically evaluate unsupported Co3O4 nanoparticles under different CO-PrOx environments, that is, with/without H-2, H2O, and/or CO2. The presence of H-2 in the feed (with no H2O and CO2) results in the unwanted competitive conversion of the co-fed O-2 to H2O and in the reduction of Co3O4 to Co-0. The presence of Co-0 favors CH4 formation from CO, which is also undesired as it consumes valuable H-2. Co-feeding H2O not only decreases Co3O4 reducibility but also decreases CO oxidation activity through competitive surface adsorption. The forward water-gas shift is possible in the absence of CO2 in the feed over CoO and Co-0 at elevated reaction temperatures. Co-feeding CO2 has no effect on Co3O4 reducibility but leads to the unwanted CO2 methanation and reverse water-gas shift over Co-0. For the first time, the presented work shows the individual and combined effect of H-2, H2O, and CO2 on the progress of the targeted CO oxidation process through the occurrence of undesired side reactions. Also, for the first time, in situ catalyst characterization reveals the Co-based phase(s) responsible for the occurrence of each identified side reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200020

This Account highlights his key scientific achievements in three areas of significance: supported metal clusters and atomically dispersed metal complexes, hydroprocessing reaction networks and catalysts, and strong acid catalysis. His contributions in all three areas are noteworthy and have been sustained over 50 years. The work of his group evolved from mainly catalyst synthesis and reaction studies to also incorporate sophisticated characterization techniques based on X-ray absorption spectroscopies and improved scanning transmission electron microscopic examination of catalytic surfaces. In the course of this work, he has addressed, and contributed to the solutions of some of the most significant and challenging problems in catalysis of the last half century.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200021

Mass-transfer phenomena are thoroughly investigated, and the mass-transfer coefficient is deconvoluted from the intrinsic kinetic constant for each catalyst to enable the quantitative assessment of both. NbPO is found to be mass-transfer-limited. Despite this limitation, NbPO shows the highest yield of LA at 36%. The reaction over ZrPO is not transport-limited, allowing for a rigorous analysis of intrinsic kinetics. This analysis shows that the conversion of DHA into pyruvaldehyde (PVA) follows a second-order reaction mechanism via a dimeric intermediate, which consolidates previous reports in the literature. Additionally, a correlation between LA production and the carbon missing from the carbon balance (carbon loss) is observed. Finally, NbPO and ZrPO show stable performance up to 10 h on stream at 150 degrees C. After 15 h of reaction, the PVA yield increases at the expense of LA with NbPO. This is ascribed to the deactivation of the active sites necessary to produce LA, which are different from the sites that produce PVA. This hypothesis is supported by the characterization of the spent catalyst with C-13 magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200022

GY is a decent support for isolated transition-metal (TM) atom catalysts because the most active sp-hybridized carbon atoms exist on the GY surface. All the single TM atoms are trapped into the void of the GY surface and existed in the isolated form. The molecular geometries and adsorbate binding energies of NO@TM-GY, ON@TM-GY, and O-2@TM-GY configurations are determined. We find that the Cr-GY is the most promising SAC for NO oxidation and reduction compared with the other TM-SACs. Herein, we report an efficient NO oxidation and reduction catalyzed by Cr-GY at ambient temperature. We find that Cr-GY SAC is very reactive for NO oxidation and reduction at ambient temperatures with low activation barriers to the rate-determining steps for Eley-Rideal (0.87, 0.60, and 0.62 eV) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (0.69, 0.62, and 0.84 eV) mechanisms. The Termolecular Eley-Rideal mechanism for the formation of the NO2 molecule is not thermodynamically favorable. Comparative analysis revealed that the NO reduction (0.62 eV) is more favorable than NO oxidation (0.84 eV). These findings provide valuable perceptions for design of highly efficient and selective heterogeneous SACs for NO oxidation and reduction with TMs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200023

Despite considerable progress, the specificity of alkene substrates or the adjustment of ligands was necessary for specific regioselectivities, which restrict the universality and practicability. Herein, we report a ligand-free iron-catalyzed regiodivergent hydroboration of aliphatic terminal alkenes that obtains both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov hydroboration products in high regioselectivities. Notably, solvents and bases were shown to be crucial factors influencing the regioselectivities and further studies suggested that the iron-boron alkoxide ate complex is the key intermediate that determines the unusual Markovnikov regioselectivity. Terminal alkenes with diverse structures (monosubstituted and 1,1-disubstituted, open-chain and exocyclic) underwent the transformation smoothly. The reaction does not require the addition of auxiliary ligands and it can be performed on a gram scale, thus providing an efficient and sustainable method for the synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl borates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200025

We developed a rhodium-catalyzed C-H functionalization of indoles at the C4 position using alpha,beta-unsaturated enones as versatile DGs. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the C-H activation process was reversible and the course of Rh-carbene generation controlled the overall site-selectivity of the C-H functionalization. The introduced malonate unit and the used enone DG were cyclized in a further C-C bond forming process to assemble 3,4-fused tricyclic indoles in an asymmetric manner. Telescoping the two reaction sequences provided rapid entry into this densely functionalized indole architecture from readily available chemical feedstock.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200026

Among these approaches, allylic fluorination is a reaction that relies on a key carbon-fluorine bond-forming step to generate allylic fluorides. These fluorinated products can serve as building blocks for the preparation of valuable fluorine-containing synthons. Such important motifs can be found in agrochemicals, pharmaceutical agents, and PET radiotracers. Despite their prevalence and the importance of their applications, efficient methodology for their selective synthesis remains underdeveloped. Significant progress has been made in the past decade with the use of transition metals as catalysts. The search for a triad of transition metal, nucleophilic fluoride source, and leaving group enables the discovery of new allylic fluorination methods. This Perspective critically assesses recent efforts made to expand the methodology used to construct allylic C-F bonds via nucleophilic fluoride sources and provides a thorough analysis of their performance.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200027

Here, we report the single-atom doping effect on CO2 reduction by comparing monopalladium-doped Pd1Au24 and homogold Au-25 nanoclusters (both protected by thiolates) that share an identical core structure. Experimental results show that single Pd-substitution drastically inhibits H-2 evolution at large currents; thus, Pd1Au24 can convert CO2 to CO with similar to 100% faradaic efficiency ranging from -0.6 (onset) to -1.2 V (vs RHE), while Au-25 starts to decline at -0.9 V. Theoretical simulations reveal that the Pd dopant influences the Au nanocluster properties through a unique mechanism different from that in conventional alloy nanoparticles. The surface S atoms of the thiolate ligand are identified as the active sites (with the Au-13 core as the electron reservoir) for selective CO2 reduction, whereas undercoordinated Au atom active sites are predicted to favor H-2 evolution. Thermodynamic analysis of the ligand removal process predicts that Pd1Au24 should retain a larger population of S atom active sites under cathodic potentials compared with Au-25, which extends the potential range for selective CO2 reduction. Our results demonstrate that single-atom substitution can substantially improve the CO2 reduction selectivity of gold nanoclusters at large potentials. The dopant-induced ligand stability may serve as a design strategy to modify the stability of catalytic active sites under harsh conditions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200028

For example, TiO2-supported manganese oxide, a promising material for catalyzing the selective reduction of NO with NH3 at very low temperatures, is currently restricted by poor selectivity because of the production of unwanted N2O, which has a greenhouse gas potential 300 times higher than that of CO2. In this study, we located manganese oxides in microporous TiO2 with small pores of molecular dimensions and found that this catalyst exhibited superior N-2 selectivity (more than 98% at 100-200 degrees C) as compared to that of conventional Mn/TiO2 nanoparticles. The enhancement in N-2 selectivity was consistently observed regardless of the amount of Mn active sites, demonstrating that the confining void environment is able to affect the site-specific selectivity of manganese oxides. When the reaction was performed at a low temperature (175 degrees C), it was found that the same reactive intermediate, possibly ammonium nitrate, was formed and deposited on both catalysts. However, the N-2 selectivity in the reaction of this intermediate and NO was greatly improved in small-pore environments. In addition, it was demonstrated that such reactive intermediates are effectively stabilized when confined in small pores, thereby blocking the reaction pathway in which the intermediates directly decompose into N2O. This approach to confining active sites within the pores of support materials provides a rational strategy for designing highly selective catalytic materials.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200029

Variations in the reaction conditions make it difficult to compare the performance characteristics of different catalysts, however, and limits the ability to leverage insights to design improved catalysts. Here, we show that free energy relationships between the logarithm of the turnover frequency [log(TOF)] and the effective overpotential (eta(eff)) for the ORR enable systematic comparison of the catalytic performance of diverse Co-macrocycles under a variety of reaction conditions. The study is initiated by evaluating the ORR log(TOF)/eta(eff) correlation for a series of Co(porphyrin) catalysts. The data show that these catalysts exhibit a different linear free energy relationship relative to previously reported Co(N2O2) complexes and that this difference correlates with different rate laws associated with the two different classes of catalysts. These linear relationships are then compared to log(TOF)/eta(eff) data for a diverse collection of other homogeneous cobalt ORR catalysts reported previously in the literature, and the collective analysis shows how different catalyst systems and their performance may be compared, even when the reactions are conducted under different conditions. This benchmarking method is recommended as a general strategy for systematic comparison of other (electro)catalysts and catalytic reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200030

In the study, the reactivity of the methyl glycosides in DODH was clearly lower than that of simple cyclic vicinal diols, such as cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol and cis-1,2-cyclo-pentanediol, and the reactivity of the methyl glycosides was also different. Herein, we investigated the reactivity difference based on kinetic studies and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The kinetic studies suggest that the reactivity difference between the methyl glycosides and the simple diols is derived from the OH group of methyl glycosides except the cis-vicinal diols, and that the reactivity difference among the methyl glycosides will be associated with the configuration of the substituents adjacent to the cis-vicinal diols, while the reaction mechanism of DODH is suggested to be basically similar judging from almost the same reaction orders with respect to the substrate concentration and H-2 pressure in all substrates. The adsorption and transition states of methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside and methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside, which have a large reactivity difference (methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside >> methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside), were estimated by DFT calculations with ReOx/CeO2 as the active site of the ReOx-Pd/CeO2 catalyst, showing that the main difference is the activation energy in DODH of these substrates (65 kJ mol(-1) for methyl alpha-Lrhamnopyranoside and 77 kJ mol(-1) for methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside), which was also supported by the results of Arrhenius plots (63 and 73 kJ mol(-1) for methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside and methyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside, respectively). The activation energy was influenced by the torsional angle of the substituents adjacent to the cis-vicinal OH groups, which is derived from the interaction of the OH group adjacent to the cis-vicinal OH groups and the surface hydroxy groups on CeO2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200031

These interfacial sites play a vital role in many renewable applications, for instance, catalytic CO2 reduction. Postsynthesis deposition of metal oxide on supported metal catalysts can not only create such interfacial sites but also prevent particle sintering at high temperature. Here, we report a sol-gel-based strategy to synthesize an atomically dispersed "precatalyst". In contrast to the deposition on catalysts containing preformed nanoparticles, overcoating this material before reductive treatment can inhibit particle growth during thermal activation steps, yielding highly accessible, sintering-resistant Pd clusters that are less than 2 nm in diameter. This synthetic approach allows us to engineer interfacial sites while maintaining high metal accessibility, which was difficult to achieve in previous overcoated materials. Notably, engineering the Pd-ZrO2 interface into an inverted interface with an amorphous ZrO2 overcoat might facilitate a C-O cleavage route instead of a mechanism containing a bicarbonate intermediate during CO2 hydrogenation. We also observed that carbon deposition occurring on methanation sites could be a key factor for improving CO selectivity. Alteration of the reaction pathway, along with the deactivation of certain sites, led to 100% CO selectivity on the ZrO2@Pd/ZrO2 catalyst. This work demonstrated that overcoated materials could represent a promising class of heterogeneous catalysts for selective CO2 conversion over noble metals, which have higher rates and thermal stability compared to state-of-the-art Cu-based catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200033

Previous studies suggest that Co atoms located at the Co-MnO perimeter adsorb CO more strongly and undergo C-O bond cleavage more readily than CO adsorbed on Co sites, which leads to improved C5+ selectivity. Thus, direct characterization of the formation and structure of the active interface between Co nanoparticles and MnO is essential for a full understanding of the FTS promotion effect. Scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) methods are well-suited for direct characterization of nanoscale features through imaging, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping, and spatially resolved electron diffraction, a technique known as scanning nanobeam diffraction. However, these techniques require that the catalytic nanoparticles are non-overlapping and well-defined, which is not typical for nanoparticles on porous metal oxide FTS supports. In the present study, we addressed these challenges by synthesizing catalysts composed of cobalt dispersed on nonporous alumina nanospheres (Co/ANS), which yielded isolated nanoparticles that are amenable to elemental and phase mapping by STEM-EDS and scanning nanobeam diffraction. Then, manganese oxide-promoted Co/ANS (Mn-Co/ANS) was characterized using these two techniques, which provided direct evidence for the transformation of a Co-Mn oxide spinel present in the as-prepared catalyst into closely associated Co3O4 and MnO2 nanoparticles in the passivated catalyst after its use for FTS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200034

Herein, Ti3+-enriched N,C-codoped mixed-phase TiO2 nanoparticles featuring a reduced (compared to that of pristine TiO2) band gap and containing Ti3+ ions, oxygen vacancies, and Ti-X bonds (X = O, OH, N, C) were synthesized as a durable PEMFC cathode support by annealing. The extent of doping was controlled by adjustment of dopant (urea) loading, while the abundance of defect sites resulted in an enhanced metal-support interaction (i.e., Pt-Ti bonding) for Pt/N,C-codoped TiO2, as confirmed by the shift of the most prominent Pt-0 peak of Pt/N,C-codoped TiO2 to lower binding energies (by 0.96 eV) relative to that of Pt/C. Electrochemical performance testing of the above support revealed its high activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and elevated durability. In particular, a maximum power density decrease of only 4% (cf. 52% for Pt/C under the same conditions) and high durability under PEMFC operation conditions were observed in a single-cell test. Thus, the presented results highlight the great potential of TiO2 as an electrocatalyst support, paving the way to the fabrication of high-performance hydrogen fuel cells and contributing to the establishment of a hydrogen society.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200035

Here we uncover the catalytic molecular mechanism of GALC using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods. Our results clarify the unusual chair conformation of the substrate observed in the crystal structure and show that catalysis can take place via two distinct conformational pathways (S-1(3) -> [H-4(3)]double dagger -> C-4(1) and C-4(1) ->[H-4(3)]double dagger -> C-4(1)) with similar free energy barriers because of leaving group flexibility. This mechanistic insight will aid in the design of Krabbe diagnosis probes and GALC conformational chaperones.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200036

However, precise control of C-O activation and subsequent C-C coupling toward those olefins remain a challenge, due to the unclear catalytic mechanism on active sites and surrounding promoters. Herein, we demonstrate that the carbonaceous series K-promoters from K2CO3, CH3COOK, KHCO3, and KOH can induce Fe/C catalysts to form a more active and distinct Fe5C2-K2CO3 interface in nanoscale via CO2 hydrogenation, which boosts the production of high-valued olefins by facilitating electron transfer from potassium to iron species. A high olefin selectivity of near 75% in hydrocarbons is realized at a conversion of more than 32%. The maximum yield of high-valued olefins reaches up to 20.1%, which is the record-breaking highest value among all Fe based CO2 hydrogenation in the literature. More interestingly, the appropriate proximity between carbonaceous K-promoters and Fe/C catalyst endow the catalytic system with an outstanding high-valued olefin yield and high catalytic stability. These findings enrich the chemistry of CO2 conversion and provide a strategy to design highly selective catalysts for high-valued chemicals.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200037

However, there is rarely a report about the increase in oxygen vacancies using a facile method in monolith catalysts. Besides, the corresponding mechanism of the promotional effects of oxygen vacancies over the monolith catalysts still remains elusive. In this work, Co3O4 nanowires with abundant oxygen vacancies in situ grown on the Ni foam (r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam) were synthesized and used as high-performance monolith catalysts for catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde. The r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts showed outstanding catalytic activity and stability. The T10 (temperature when HCHO conversion achieved 10%) of r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts (75 degrees C) was lower than that of Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts (100 degrees C) and Co3O4 NP catalysts (132 degrees C). More importantly, the r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts have more active oxygen species because of the promotional effects of surface oxygen vacancies. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTs) results revealed that the formate species were reaction intermediates of HCHO catalytic oxidation reactions. However, the formate species on the surface of r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts were more active thus could easily take part in catalytic reactions. Furthermore, combined with the calculation results, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies could weaken O-2 adsorption energy and make r-Co3O4 NW@Ni foam catalysts adsorb and store more active oxygen species, thus promoting more reaction intermediates to generate with a higher rate in redox cycles. The present investigations in this work may lead to an alternative development of high-performance monolith catalysts for VOC catalytic oxidation.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200039

However, the effect of alloy composition has not been systematically studied. Herein, using metallic anodes with defined Fe-Ni-Co atomic ratios prepared via arc melting, we report the relationship between the initial alloy composition, the OER performance, and the emergent active catalyst composition. After 50 h operation at 0.5 A cm(-2) the most active initial alloys (having a moderate amount of cobalt <40 at. %, an iron proportion between 30 and 80 at. % and a nickel ratio below 60 at. %) gave average overpotentials for 10 mA cm(-2) ca. 300-320 mV and Tafel slopes of 35-50 mV dec(-1). Iron and nickel-rich alloys performed poorer. The oxyhydroxide OER catalyst formed on the anode surface generally showed an increased concentration of Co and Ni and a depletion of Fe compared to the initial metal composition, giving the most active OER catalyst at a composition of Ni and Co of ca. 40 at. % with Fe at ca. 20 at. %. However, the initial alloy composition of Fe12.5Co12.5Ni75, showed a nearly invariant surface metal composition, indicating this as the most stable composition. Further analysis of the surface identified no correlation of the mass of metals leached from the anode surface, the electrochemically active surface area, or the presence of active Ni2+/3+ redox surface sites to the OER performance suggesting these factors do not influence the results.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200040

Here, we employed density functional theory to study Co-N-doped carbon as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Specifically, we investigated the interplay among adsorption energies, the spin state of the CoN4 active center, and the applied potential. We found that adsorption energies strongly depend on both the applied potential and the spin state of the Co center. Furthermore, spin state transitions induced by the applied potential also play an important role in determining the adsorption energies. This effect originates from a different potential of zero charge and capacitance of each spin state.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200041

To obtain insight into the structure of this layer and possible surface phases, CO structures on a Co(0001) model have been investigated by high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The experiments were performed in situ, at CO pressures between 10(-9) and 800 mbar and at a temperature of 300 K. Under these conditions, an adsorption-desorption equilibrium was established, reflecting the situation of the reaction. A series of CO surface phases were observed; from 10(-9) to 10(-7) mbar, a (root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees structure; between 10(-6) and 10(-3) mbar, a disordered phase representing a nonstoichiometric, fluctuating (root 7 x root 7)R19.1 degrees structure; and between 10(-2) and 100 mbar, a (2 root 3 x 2 root 3)R30 degrees structure. Between 100 and 800 mbar, three moire structures were observed that were analyzed by a recently developed method. All phases were formed by intact CO molecules. A phase diagram was obtained that allowed us to extrapolate the stability regions of the CO phases to industrial Fischer-Tropsch conditions. We conclude that the reaction operates in the region of the disordered phase at a coverage between 0.43 and 0.50 monolayers of CO.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200042

In the presence of an advanced ligand L2 bearing 2-pyridyl substituent as a built-in base, either hydroformylation or semihydrogenation of diverse alkynes occurs with high chemo- and stereoselectivity under comparable conditions. Mechanistic studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, kinetic analysis, and control experiments, revealed that the strength and concentration of acidic cocatalysts play a decisive role in controlling the chemoselectivity. DFT studies disclosed that ligand L2 not only promotes heterolytic activation of hydrogen similar to frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) systems in the hydrogenolysis step for hydroformylation but also suppresses CO coordination to promote semihydrogenation under strong acid conditions. This switchable selectivity provides a strategy to design new catalysts for desired products.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200043

In this work, we explore several Ru-based pyrochlores (A(2)Ru(2)O(7), A = Y, Nd, Gd, Bi) as OER catalysts and demonstrate improved activity and stability of catalytic Ru sites relative to RuO2. Furthermore, we combine complementary experimental and theoretical analysis to understand how the A-site element impacts activity and stability under acidic OER conditions. Among the A(2)Ru(2)O(7) studied herein, we find that a longer Ru-O bond and a weaker interaction of the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals compared with RuO2 results in enhanced initial activity. We observe that the OER activity of the catalysts changes over time and is accompanied by both A-site and Ru dissolution at different relative rates depending on the identity of the A-site. Pourbaix diagrams constructed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a driving force for this experimentally observed dissolution, indicating that all compositions studied herein are thermodynamically unstable in acidic OER conditions. Theoretical activity predictions show consistent trends between A-site cation leaching and OER activity. These trends coupled with Bader charge analysis suggest that dissolution exposes highly oxidized Ru sites that exhibit enhanced activity. Overall, using the stability number (mol(O2 evolved)/mol(Ru dissolved)) as a comparative metric, the A(2)Ru(2)O(7) materials studied in this work show substantially greater stability than a standard RuO2 and commensurate stability to some Ir mixed metal oxides. The insights described herein provide a pathway to enhanced Ru catalyst activity and durability, ultimately improving the efficiency of water electrolyzers.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200044		
J	Vega-Vila, Juan Carlos; Gounder, Rajamani								Quantification of Intraporous Hydrophilic Binding Sites in Lewis Acid Zeolites and Consequences for Sugar Isomerization Catalysis								ACS CATALYSIS				10	20			12197	12211		10.1021/acscatal.0c02918				OCT 16 2020	2020	Aqueous-phase sugar isomerization is catalyzed at lower turnover rates when Lewis acid active sites are confined within high-defect zeolite micropores, because intraporous silanol groups serve as hydrophilic binding sites that stabilize extended water networks during catalysis that entropically destabilize isomerization transition states relative to their precursors. The number of intraporous silanol defects varies widely among Lewis acid zeolites prepared by different hydrothermal and post-synthetic routes, and after subsequent activation treatments prior to catalysis, thus leading to unintended or unpredictable consequences for reactivity. Here, we develop a suite of methods to characterize and quantify intraporous silanol groups in Lewis acid zeolites and provide a link between the number of such groups and glucose isomerization rate constants. Sn-Beta zeolites were prepared with systematically varying silanol density by increasing the extent of Sn grafting into various dealuminated Beta supports, which were derived from parent Al-Beta zeolites synthesized both with varying initial Al content (Si/Al = 19-180, 0.4-3.2 Al (unit cell)(-1)) and defect density via the mineralizing agent used (F-, OH-). The packing density of methanol within micropores was used as a reporter of the intraporous silanol density and was quantified from relative methanol (293 K) and dinitrogen (77 K) uptakes at the point of micropore filling from single-component adsorption isotherms; methanol packing densities decreased systematically from 0.98 to 0.07 among Sn-Beta samples with increasing SiOH density. In situ IR spectra (CH3OH reduced pressure < 0.2, 303 K) indicate that methanol arranges in isolated clusters within low-defect Sn-Beta micropores (<1 silanol (unit cell)(-1)), but forms extended hydrogen-bonded networks within high-defect micropores (>1 silanol (unit cell)(-1)). On each sample, the total number of extracrystalline and intraporous SiOH groups was quantified by H/D isotopic exchange with D-2 via temperature-programmed surface reaction (500-873 K), while the number of intraporous SiOH groups was quantified from strongly H-bound CD3CN in IR spectra (2275 cm(-1), 303 K). Aqueous-phase first-order glucose isomerization rate constants (per defect-open Sn, 373 K) were 4 times higher on Sn-Beta prepared post-synthetically from dealuminated Beta supports whose parent Al-Beta zeolites were initially low-defect (<0.6 Al (unit cell)(-1)) than high-defect (>0.6 Al (unit cell)(-1)). These findings constitute a synthesis-structure-function relationship that provides specific guidance to minimize the density of intraporous defects when using post-synthetic routes to prepare catalytic materials with reactivity comparable to their hydrothermally crystallized hydrophobic analogues.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200045

The discovery of an enzyme with 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose to produce D-tagatose has been a major goal in the sugar industry. However, no enzymes used for the direct production of D-tagatose from D-fructose have been identified until now. Here, we identified a tagaturonate 3-epimerase from Thermotoga petrophila with latent 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose. We developed this enzyme into tagatose 4-epimerase by increasing the 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose using structure-based engineering, including favorable interaction analysis and active-site modifications, and random mutagenesis, including saturation mutagenesis and DNA shuffling after error-prone PCR. The developed tagatose 4-epimerase, which showed 184-fold higher 4-epimerization activity toward D-fructose than that of tagaturonate 3-epimerase, produced 213 g/L D-tagatose using D-fructose in 2 h. Our results suggest that the tagatose 4-epimerase is an alternative enzyme for D-tagatose production via a different biocatalytic route.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200046

Iron-dependent oxygenases exploit this earth-abundant transition metal for the insertion of oxygen atoms into organic compounds. Throughout the astounding diversity of transformations catalyzed by these enzymes, the protein framework directs reactive intermediates toward the precise formation of products, which, in many cases, necessitates the cleavage of strong C-H bonds. In recent years, members of several iron-dependent oxygenase families have been engineered for new-to-nature transformations that offer advantages over conventional synthetic methods. In this Perspective, we first explore what is known about the reactivity of heme-dependent cytochrome P450 oxygenases and nonheme iron-dependent oxygenases bearing the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad by reviewing mechanistic studies with an emphasis on how the protein scaffold maximizes the catalytic potential of the iron-heme and iron cofactors. We then review how these cofactors have been repurposed for abiological transformations by engineering the protein frameworks of these enzymes. Finally, we discuss contemporary challenges associated with engineering these platforms and comment on their roles in biocatalysis moving forward.									13	0	0	0	4	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200049	33282461

Conjugated polymers (CPs)-based materials have recently shown great potential for diverse photocatalytic applications because of their unique properties, such as structural designability, recyclability, high chemical stability, and low cost, and they have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional molecular or inorganic photocatalyst in photoredox reactions. Immense efforts have been made toward the construction of CPs-based materials for versatile photocatalytic chemical transformations. In this Review, we aim to summarize the recent progress in CPs-based photocatalysts for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations including oxidation, reduction, coupling, and cycloaddition reaction. This Review discusses the influence of molecular, electronic, and channel structure of CPs-based materials on light absorption, charge separation, and mass transfer in different photocatalytic photoredox reactions. The regulated synthesis, mechanistic discussions, and future challenges for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformation in CPs-based materials systems are also considered. It is expected that this Review could not only deepen the comprehension of photocatalytic organic transformation but also open up inspirations and feasibilities for the applications of CPs-based materials.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200050

Addressing this challenge requires catalysts that can rapidly turnover with good selectivity and energetic efficiency. Herein, aqueous electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion using drop cast films of cobalt(II) 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin (CoTPOH) are described. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments show redox features that are consistent with formation of a Co-III-CO intermediate at near the CO2/CO thermodynamic potential that then releases CO upon further 1-electron reduction. Analysis of CV and controlled potential electrolysis experiments show that CoTPOH catalyzes the reduction of CO2 to CO with 50% Faradaic efficiency at 0.2 V applied overpotential. With >0.5 V applied overpotential, stable catalytic current density (>= 0.2 mA/cm(2)) is observed during 24 h of electrolysis, with 92% Faradaic efficiency for CO. The behavior of CoTPOH is distinct from the parent Co(II)(5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin) deposited on basal plane graphite under identical electrochemical conditions. These results demonstrate that CO2 reduction and activation are possible at very little overpotential in aqueous electrolyte, but CO release from Co(III) at low potentials is the limiting factor. The proposed mechanism offers alternative pathways to consider in the design and implementation of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. The incorporation of proton relays into heterogeneous catalysts remains a challenge, and this study of CoTPOH suggests that they can have a significant impact on catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200051

However, the full breadth of means by which the stereoselectivity of these catalysts can be tuned has not been fully elucidated. Herein, the origin of enantioselectivity in a catalytic asymmetric synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolinones using SPINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acids (ACS Catal. 2013, 3, 2244) is explored using density functional theory computations. We show that the enantioselectivity of this reaction is determined during the intramolecular amine addition step of an organocascade sequence and is modulated by differential noncovalent interactions of the substrate with the aryl groups of the catalyst as well as CH center dot center dot center dot O and NH center dot center dot center dot O interactions with the phosphate core of the catalyst. Most notably, we demonstrate that the strength of these latter interactions is modulated by their position within the electrostatic environment created by the catalyst. This provides clear evidence of the ability to precisely control the selectivity of an organocatalyzed reaction through the tuning of electrostatic interactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200052

To mitigate carbon corrosion, Pt is alloyed with iridium (Ir), which is catalytically active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with various compositions of PtxIry. The carbon-supported PtxIry alloy catalysts (PtxIry/C) show slightly lower initial activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than Pt/C. However, the ORR activities of the PtxIry/C catalysts increase with repeating potential cycles from 1.0 to 1.5 V-RHE, while Pt/C exhibits a rapid decay in the ORR activity and a mixture of Pt/C and Ir/C (Pt/C + Ir/C, Pt-to-Ir ratio of 85:15) maintains its initial activity. After 5k potential cycles, the mass activity of Pt85Ir15 was 0.071 A mg(PGM)(-1), which is significantly higher than that of Pt/C (0.017 A mg(PGM)(-1)) and Pt/C + Ir/C (0.039 A mg(PGM)(-1)). These results can be attributed to the atomically distributed Ir in Pt85Ir15. Clearly, carbon corrosion occurs in Pt/C and in Pt-rich regions of Pt/C + Ir/C, whereas the carbon support in Pt85Ir15/C is effectively protected from corrosion. As a result, the greatest amount of CO2 emission is detected as coming from Pt/C, followed by Pt/C + Ir/C and Pt85Ir15/C. During the potential cycles, high-index Pt facets are formed on the surface of Pt85Ir15/C, leading to an increase in the ORR activity. When employed as cathode catalysts of a PEMFC, Pt85Ir15/C exhibits improved durability compared to Pt/C and Pt/C + Ir/C under high-voltage cycles to 1.5 V (5k cycles). This work demonstrates that the atomic distribution of Ir in Pt is an effective strategy for mitigating corrosion of the carbon support and to enhance the durability of PEMFCs exposed to high potentials.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200053

As guaiacol adsorbs on Ru, it loses its strong aromaticity and undergoes a rapid H-shift from its hydroxyl to meta carbons (in relation to its hydroxyl group), causing adsorbed enol and keto surface isomers to exist in chemical equilibrium. HDO occurs via a hydridic H-adatom (H*) attack on the enol, followed by a kinetically relevant C-O bond rupture step, during which water shuttles the hydroxyl proton, enabling its intra-molecular attack on the methoxy, evolving to a highly charged [Ru-(s)-(C6H5O-)center dot center dot center dot(H+)center dot center dot center dot OCH3](dagger) transition state. The competing hydrogenation (HYD) begins with a rapid H* attack on the keto form, before a second, kinetically relevant H* attack without proton involvement. Water, despite shifting the thermodynamics toward the more polar surface keto, promotes HDO to a much greater extent than HYD, because of its dual catalytic roles in reducing the activation free energies-(i) it mobilizes the hydroxyl proton of partially saturated guaiacol (Bronsted acid) and functions cooperatively with the Ru metal surface (base) in rupturing the C-O bond and stabilizing the resulting cationic carbon-ring fragment and (ii) water layers solvate the charged [Ru-(s)-(C6H5O-)center dot center dot center dot(H+)center dot center dot center dot OCH3]dagger transition state. Free hydronium ions do catalyze a separate homogeneous enol-keto isomerization, but this reaction is kinetically unrelated to HDO catalysis. This mechanistic picture explains the strong effects of a polar protic solvent in hydrodeoxygenation, highlighting the requirements of surface hydrides and interfacial protons acting in tandem to complete a HDO turnover and the cooperative role of the protic solvent and the metal surface in breaking the aromaticity and preferentially stabilizing charged transition states.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200054

The reaction intermediate in the important Cu-I -> Cu-II reoxidation step has been proposed as the dicopper species. However, obtaining the definitive spectroscopic probe for the dicopper intermediate under NH3-SCR remains a quite challenging subject. Here we report spectroscopic evidence of the efficient generation of the dicopper intermediate in NH3-SCR over Cu-ion-exchanged zeolites. The state of the Cu ion under the NH3-SCR condition was analyzed using fiber-optic UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy; a distinct spectroscopic fingerprint of the (mu-eta(2):eta(2)-peroxo)dicopper(II) intermediate was detected. Our spectroscopic assignment was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. The intensity of the spectroscopic fingerprints of dimeric copper was much higher than expected from previous reports, and it was also found that such a spectroscopic probe is observable only under the NH3-SCR conditions. This finding strongly supports the previously suggested Cu dynamic contributions to NH3-SCR catalysis.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200055

Hemoproteins have recently emerged as promising biocatalysts for the formation of C-N bonds via carbene transfer, but asymmetric N-H carbene insertion reactions using these or other enzymes have so far been elusive. Here, we report the successful development of a biocatalytic strategy for the asymmetric N-H carbene insertion of aromatic amines with 2-diazopropanoate esters using engineered variants of myoglobin. High activity and stereoinduction in this reaction could be achieved by tuning the chiral environment around the heme cofactor in the metalloprotein in combination with catalyst-matching and tailoring of the diazo reagent. Using this approach, an efficient biocatalytic protocol for the synthesis of a broad range of substituted aryl amines with up to 82% ee was obtained. In addition, a stereocomplementary catalyst useful to access the mirror-image form of the N-H insertion products was identified. This work paves the way to asymmetric amine synthesis via biocatalytic carbene transfer, and the present strategy based on the synergistic combination of protein and diazo reagent engineering is expected to prove useful in the context of these as well as other challenging asymmetric carbene transfer reactions.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300014	34484852

The described method tolerates a variety of functional groups and provides access to a broad scope of trans-configurated cyclohexanols as potential building blocks for life sciences and beyond in a one-step procedure. The transformation is strategically important because arene hydrogenation preferentially delivers the opposite cis-isomers. The diastereoselectivity of the phenol hydrogenation can be switched to the cis-isomers by employing rhodium-based catalysts. Moreover, a protocol for the chemoselective hydrogenation of phenols to cyclohexanones was developed.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300042	33133752

We select isoprene (2-methylbutadiene) as a representative and relevant example of a nonsymmetric diene. A combined experimental-computational study on a large set of phosphine-modified palladium catalysts and reaction conditions aiming to understand the factors governing the selectivity shows that it can be controlled by selecting the protic solvent pK(a) and by the ligand. Atomistic and kinetic simulations reveal that the solvent switches the selectivity-determining step as a function of pK(a) from C-C oxidative coupling at low pKa values (preference for telomer head-to-head) to protonation at high pK(a) values (preference for telomer tail-to-tail). The selectivity toward tail-to-head telomer can be directed in moderately acidic solvents by selection of the appropriate ligand, which exerts steric control of the protonation step. Thus, using Et2NH as a nucleophile, it was possible to synthesize 3 of the 4 main isomers in very high yields and selectivities and to provide a complete mechanistic picture of Pd-catalyzed telomerization of nonsymmetric dienes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300053

Palladium-catalyzed C-H functionalization of the low-reactive C3 position was successfully performed in 2,5-diformylfuran, an important derivative of the biobased platform chemical 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural. The ligand-free catalytic arylation was carried out without using protecting or directing groups, which is of key importance for the studied area to achieve waste-minimized and step-economic biomass processing. The experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations revealed a reaction mechanism and indicated that the presence of the aldehyde group is essential for catalytic reaction. Enolization of the aldehyde group and Pd binding play an important role in governing the overall C-H functionalization pathway.

In the hope to improve this condition, three ruthenium olefin metathesis catalysts bearing sterically reduced N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands with xylyl "arms" were synthesized, characterized using both computational and experimental techniques, and tested in a number of challenging reactions. The catalysts are predicted to initiate much faster than the analogue with mesityl N-substituents. We also foreboded the rotation of xylyl side groups at ambient temperature and the existence of all four atropoisomers in the solution, which was in agreement with experimental data. These catalysts exhibited high activity at relatively low temperatures (45-60 degrees C) and at reduced catalyst loadings in various reactions of sterically hindered alkenes, including complex polyfunctional substrates of pharmaceutical interest, such as yangonin precursors, chrysantemic acid derivatives, analogues of cannabinoid agonists, alpha-terpineol, and finally a thermally unstable peroxide.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300046	33123411

Amines constitute an aggressive challenge to ruthenium metathesis catalysts. Examined here is the impact of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), morpholine, n-butylamine, and triethylamine on Ru metathesis catalysts that represent the current state of the art, including cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes. Accordingly, the amine-tolerance of the nitro-Grela catalyst RuCl2(H(2)IMes)(=CHAr) (nG; Ar = C6H4-2-(OPr)-Pr-i-5-NO2) is compared with that of its CAAC analogues nGC1 and nGC2, and the Hoveyda-class catalyst RuCl2(C2)(=CHAr') HC2 (Ar' = C6H4-2-(OPr)-Pr-i). In C1, the carbene carbon is flanked by an N-2,6-Et2C6H3 group and a CMePh quaternary carbon; in C2, by an N-2-Pr-i-6-MeC6H3 group and a CMe2 quaternary carbon. The impact of 1 equiv amine per Ru on turnover numbers (TONs) in ring-closing metathesis of diethyl diallylmalonate was assessed at 9 ppm Ru, at RT and 70 degrees C. The deleterious impact of amines followed the trend NEt3 similar to (NH2Bu)-Bu-n << DBU similar to morpholine. Morpholine is shown to decompose nGC1 by nucleophilic abstraction of the methylidene ligand; DBU, by proton abstraction from the metallacyclobutane. Decomposition was minimized at 70 degrees C, at which nGC1 enabled TONs of ca. 60 000 even in the presence of morpholine or DBU, vs ca. 80 000 in the absence of base. Unexpectedly, H(2)IMes catalyst nG delivered 70-90% of the performance of nGC1 at high temperatures, and underwent decomposition by Bronsted base at a similar rate. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis shows that this similarity is due to comparable net electron donation by the H(2)IMes and C1 ligands. Catalysts bearing the smaller C2 ligand were comparatively insensitive to amines, owing to rapid, preferential bimolecular decomposition.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300064	33123412

However, the strong adsorption of *CO on the Fe-N-4 site embedded in intact graphene limits current density due to slow CO desorption process. Herein, we report how the manipulation of pore edges on graphene alters the local electronic structure of isolated Fe-N-4 sites and improves their intrinsic reactivity for prompting CO generation. We demonstrate that constructing holes on graphene basal plane to support Fe-N-4 can significantly enhance its CO2RR compared to the pore-deficient graphene-supported counterpart, exhibiting a CO Faradaic efficiency of 94% and a turnover frequency of 1630 h(-1) at 0.58 V vs RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the incorporation of pore edges results in the downshifting of the d-band center of Fe sites, which weakens the strength of the Fe-C bond when the *CO intermediate adsorbs on edge-hosted Fe-N-4, thus boosting the CO desorption and evolution rates. These findings suggest that engineering local support structure renders a way to design high-performance single-atom catalysts.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300001

However, most mechanistic studies regarding the decomposition of formic acid (FA), a promising hydrogen storage material, neglect hydrogen-bonding interactions even though FA is a strong hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor. Here, we probe the formation of bimolecular hydrogen-bonded complexes between FA and formate (FA-HCOO complexes) adsorbed on metal surfaces and how these complexes affect HCOO* decomposition. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on 12 close-packed (111)/(0001) and 8 open (100) surfaces of 12 transition metals-Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Ir, Ni, Os, Re, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru, we-show that FA-HCOO complexes are generally thermodynamically stable, even at elevated temperatures and pressures. We then illustrate that these complexes produce infrared spectroscopic signatures consistent with as yet unassigned experimental peaks. We last demonstrate that by stabilizing the dangling bond of monodentate HCOO*, these complexes significantly lower the barriers for rotation of HCOO* from a bidentate to a monodentate configuration, the rate-limiting step for HCOO* decomposition on many surfaces. FA thus acts as a cocatalyst for HCOO* decomposition. Our results may guide the community toward improved catalysts for reactions involving HCOO* such as FA decomposition, methanol steam reforming, and the water gas shift reaction. More broadly, our work highlights the ability of hydrogen bonding to modify the adsorbed structures of intermediates and lower the barriers for their reaction on heterogeneous catalysts. This phenomenon can be relevant for other reactions involving ammonia, alcohols, and carboxylic acids.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300002

This Perspective considers the prospects of electrocatalyst development based on a mechanism featuring the cleavage of N-2 into metal nitride complexes. By understanding the factors that control the reactivity of individual steps along the electrochemical N-2 cleavage path, opportunities for new advances are identified. Ligand design principles for facile electrochemical N-2 binding, formation of bridging N-2 complexes, thermal or photochemical N-2 cleavage, and conversion of a nitride ligand into ammonia are described, featuring recent advances and the authors' collaborative work on rhenium complexes.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300003

Psychrophilic enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures through the improved flexibility of some regions involved in the catalytic cycle. This flexibility enables an optimal conformational dynamic for the catalytic process, whose conservation in homologous enzymes that perform the same biological function has been highlighted. In this work, we demonstrated that two homologous enzymes adapted to function in niches with different temperatures exhibited different conformational dynamics. The psychrophilic bifunctional ADP-dependent PFK/GK from Methanococcoides burtonii (MbPFK/GK) shows a domain closing/opening dynamic described as a breathing-type, while its mesophilic homologue from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmPFK/GK) shows a twist-type domain closing/opening dynamic. In the psychrophilic MbPFK/GK, these conformational movements are associated with increased structural flexibility of the active site, reflected in the exponential increase of the K-m values with increasing temperature, and a greater H/D exchange of regions flanking the active site. Through sequence alignment between extant and ancestral enzymes, we identified two ion pairs outside the active site that were highly conserved in the mesophilic MmPFK/GK branch of the ADP-dependent sugar kinases family but were absent in the psychrophilic MbPFK/GK branch. Incorporation of these two ionic pairs in the psychrophilic MbPFK/GK modified the conformational dynamics of the domain closing/opening transition, the K-m dependence on temperature, and the H/D exchange, making them similar to those of its mesophilic homologue. We propose that conformational dynamics are responsible for the catalytic adaptability of this enzyme at low temperatures.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300004

One of the most promising bifunctional anode catalysts is PtRu, which has proven to be the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst in alcohol oxidation processes. While plenty of works so far have addressed the activity and mechanism of oxidation reactions on PtRu, less is known about the influence of organic fuels on the stability during operation. In this contribution, the effect of isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, formic acid, ammonia, and carbon monoxide on the stability of carbon-supported PtRu was studied both in acidic and alkaline media. The scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (online ICP-MS) technique allowed the tracking of dissolution events that occurred during the applied electrochemical protocol in real-time. Our main conclusion is that PtRu/C remained stable in the operation range of fuel cells. In addition, if the upper potential limit was further increased PtRu/C was less stable in alkaline medium in which, if compared to acidic electrolyte, approximately 4-times higher Ru and 14-times higher Pt dissolution was measured in the absence of the studied fuels. The onset potential of dissolution was not affected by the presence of fuels (except CO), while dissolution rates were notably affected, most visibly in the case of isopropanol and ammonia in alkaline media and carbon monoxide in both acidic and alkaline media. The observed phenomena are briefly discussed underlining the necessity of more detailed and mechanistic studies to fully understand the reason behind dissolution processes in the presence of the investigated fuels.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300005

Stoichiometric and catalytic carboxylation of nucleophiles, including organometallic reagents, with CO2 has been widely investigated. Since many kinds of organometallic reagents are prepared from electrophiles, transition-metal-catalyzed direct carboxylation of diverse electrophiles with CO2 has attracted much attention with high step economy and user-friendly protocols. Although significant progress has been achieved, the use of stoichiometric metallic or pyrophoric reductants is common. The renaissance of photochemistry has seen numerous efforts devoted to light-driven carboxylation with CO2, which has become one of the most active directions in this field. In this Perspective, we summarize recent advances of visible-light-driven catalytic reductive carboxylation of diverse substrates, such as unsaturated hydrocarbons, organic (pseudo)halides, and imines, with CO2 in the presence of mild electron donors, including amines, Hantzsch esters, and formates. We highlight the mechanisms of such reactions, which can proceed in the presence or absence of a photoredox catalyst or a dual visible light photoredox/transition metal catalytic system. We also discuss the future of this field and offer some insight into the challenges that remain.									38	1	0	0	3	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300006

The core-shell nanoparticle, which comprises a thin layer of catalytically active shell over a subsurface core, represents an important class of electrocatalysts. Although the internal core does not participate directly in catalysis, it influences the properties of the shell in terms of activity and stability. Furthermore, the usage of platinum-group metals (PGMs) can be greatly reduced when earth-abundant elements serve as the core materials. Thanks to these advantages, core-shell nanoparticles have attracted ever-increasing research interest. In this Perspective, we focus on recent advances of core-shell electrocatalysts constituted by earth-abundant cores and noble-metal shells. We start by discussing the factors that can influence the electrocatalytic properties of core-shell nanoparticles and move on to briefly summarize their synthetic strategies. We further discuss the core-shell electrocatalysts in terms of different core materials (low-PGM alloys, nonprecious metals, nitrides, carbides, and oxides) and showcase their electrocatalytic properties in reactions involved in water electrolysis and fuel cells. We conclude by discussing the general trends and challenges in this field.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300007

However, the high-temperature treatment typically involved during the activation of Ni-N/C catalysts makes the origin of the high activity elusive. In this work, Ni(II) phthalocyanine molecules grafted on carbon nanotube (NiPc/CNT) and heat-treated NiPc/CNT (H-NiPc/CNT) are exploited as model catalysts to investigate the impact of thermal activation on the structure of active sites and CO2RR activity. H-NiPc/CNT exhibits a similar to 4.7-fold higher turnover frequency for CO2RR to CO in comparison to NiPc/CNT. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heat treatment transforms the molecular Ni2+-N-4 sites of NiPc into Ni+-N3V (V: vacancy) and Ni+-N-3 sites incorporated in the graphene lattice that concomitantly involves breakage of Ni-N bonding, shrinkage in the Ni-N-C local structure, and decrease in the oxidation state of the Ni center from +2 to +1. DFT calculations combined with microkinetic modeling suggest that the Ni-N3V site appears to be responsible for the high CO2RR activity because of its lower barrier for the formation of * COOH intermediate and optimum *CO binding energy. In situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses further corroborate the importance of reduced Ni+ species in boosting the CO2RR activity.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300010

However, green manufacture of tartaric acid remains a grand challenge in this area. To date, chemical synthesis from nitric acid-facilitated glucose oxidation leads to only <10% yield with significant toxics as byproducts. We reported a one-pot aqueous-phase oxidation of glucose and gluconic acid using bimetallic AuPt/TiO2 catalysts in the presence of molecular O-2, with similar to 50% yield toward tartaric acid at 110 degrees C and 2 MPa. Structural characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the lattice mismatch between fcc Pt and bcc Au induces the formation of twinned boundaries in nanoclusters and Jahn-Teller distortion in an electronic field. Such structural and electronic reconfiguration leads to enhanced s-activation of the C-H bond competing with p-p electronic sharing of the C=O bond on the catalyst surface. As a result, both C-H (oxidation) and C-C (decarboxylation) bond cleavage reactions synergistically occur on the surface of bimetallic AuPt/TiO2 catalysts. Therefore, glucose and gluconic acid can be efficiently transformed into tartaric acid in a base-free medium. Lattice distortion-enhanced reconfiguration of the electronic field in Pt-based bimetallic nanocatalysts can be utilized in many other energy and environmental fields for catalyzing synergistic oxidation reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300011

However, few natural ketone reductases (KREDs) or alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHs) with high activity and stereoselectivity toward bulky-bulky ketones have yet been reported due to the strong steric hindrance of these substrates. Recent developments in protein engineering have led to biocatalysts capable of producing chiral alcohols with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. This review discusses recent advances in several approaches for the manipulation of stereoselectivity, including engineering of the binding pocket and active site loops to accommodate bulky-bulky ketones, modulating the electronic effects on attraction and repulsion between binding pocket residues and substituents of ketone substrates, and adding traceless directing groups to substrates to alter their orientation.

In this work, the coordination state and number of active sites ("Co-Mo-S") in sulfided CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts prepared with and without chelating additives were determined using in situ 1s2p resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Based on the evaluation of thiophene HDS activity as a function of the Co/Mo ratio, it was determined that only for Co/Mo < 0.1, cobalt is exclusively in interaction with the MoS2 phase, making these compositions ideal for identifying the nature of the active cobalt sites for hydrogenolysis. These cobalt promoter atoms were in centrosymmetric coordination with the MoS2 phase, with six sulfur ligands coordinated to each cobalt center. The octahedral coordination of cobalt in Co-Mo-S in alumina-supported HDS catalysts contrasts the tetrahedral cobalt coordination found in Co-promoted MoS2 model systems supported on gold or carbon. We attribute the difference to more disordered MoS2 structures in technical alumina-supported HDS catalysts. The number of Co-Mo-S sites depended strongly on the catalyst preparation method. Chelating additives, such as citric acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, increased the number of Co-Mo-S sites without significantly altering their intrinsic activity. These results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art structural characterization tools, such as RIXS, identify the structure of active sites in actual catalysts and that these structures may be different from model systems. Combining such characterization tools with guided catalyst design can provide an insight into the structure of amorphous, nanostructured materials, which aid in the development of improved heterogeneous catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300015

It is found that PA and MeByOH give rise to strong surface sensitivities in relation to both hydrogenation activity and molecular fragmentation into adsorbed species such as CO. For PA, irreversible adsorption is strongly favored for Pt{100} and Pt{110} but is weak in the case of Pt{111}. It is suggested that the presence of the primary alcohol substituent is key to this behavior, with the order of surface reactivity being Pt{100} > Pt{110} > Pt{111}. In contrast, for MeByOH, strong irreversible adsorption is observed on all three basal plane Pt surfaces and we propose that this reflects the enhanced activity of the alkyne moiety arising from the inductive effect of the two methyl groups, coupled with the decreased activity of the tertiary alcohol substituent toward fragmentation. Pt{111} also exhibits singular behavior in relation to MeByOH hydrogenation in that a sharp Raman band at 1590 cm(-1) is observed corresponding to the formation of a di-sigma/pi-bonded surface complex as the alkyne adsorbs. This band frequency is some 20 cm(-1) higher than the analogous broadband observed for PA and MeByOH adsorbed on all other basal plane Pt surfaces and may be viewed as a fingerprint of Pt{111} terraces being present at a catalyst surface undergoing hydrogenation. Insights into the hydrogenation activity of different Pt{hkl} surfaces are obtained using quantitative comparisons between Raman bands at hydrogenation potentials and at 0.4 V vs Pd/H, the beginning of the double-layer potential region, and it is asserted (with support from CV) that Pt{110} is the most active plane for hydrogenation due to the presence of surface defects generated via the lifting of the (1 x 2) to (1 x 1) clean surface reconstruction following flame annealing and hydrogen cooling. Our findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that Pt{111} planes are most likely to provide semihydrogenation selectivity of alkynes to alkenes, as reported previously.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300017	33042608

So far, with the development in synthetic methodologies and characterization techniques, SMCs with fine structures could be constructed and well-defined at the atomic level. In addition, based on computational modeling of SMCs, theoretical calculations corroborated well with experimental results, providing in-depth insights into the structure-property relationship for SMCs in catalysis. In this Review, classic synthetic strategies and key characterization techniques of SMCs are summarized. Subsequently, the applications of SMCs in important catalytic reactions based on recent studies are discussed, including aerobic oxidation, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, and photocatalytic reactions. In particular, the importance of the cluster size-effect and metal-support interactions in determining the catalytic performance of SMCs is highlighted. Lastly, challenges and prospects in SMCs' catalysis are illustrated.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300018

In this work, we report that 2-mercaptothiazole and other analogues are active for the metal-free borylation of heterocycles and terminal alkynes. Alkynes are challenging substrates to C-H borylate because they undergo side reactions with most borylating agents. The ability of these metal-free catalysts to activate B-C bonds can also be translated to the activation of B-O bonds in the products of the 1,4-conjugate addition of alkynylboranes to chalcones. It is therefore possible to prepare beta-alkynylketones from the corresponding alkynes in a process where the boron source is used in substoichiometric amounts. The mechanism and degradation patterns of these catalytic transformations have been investigated.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300019

In this work, we employ an unbiased density functional global optimization strategy to identify the locations and energetic barriers for migration pathways between sites for platinum (Pt) confined within the microporous volume of a purely silicious zeolite with Linde type A topology and its aluminosilicate and borosilicate variants. We observe an impressive stabilization of single Pt atoms caused by a hitherto unreported binding mode, in which the six rings in the framework are broken, leading to trapped, highly accessible metal centers. In addition, heteroatom substituents are found to significantly enhance the incorporation of Pt via an unexpected insertion into framework SiO-H bonds. Migration of Pt is hindered by high barriers, which are predicted to vary significantly with Si:X (X = Al and B) ratios. It is proposed that an optimal Si:X ratio exists for a given zeolite topology, in which the barriers will reach the maximum value. The energetic preference for Pt clustering (via Ostwald ripening) remains but is significantly reduced with respect to isolated clusters because of the strong interactions between Pt atoms and the framework. Our findings suggest a means to control noble-metal particle sintering, despite a thermodynamic driving force toward Pt clustering. This work provides an explanation for the surprisingly high degree of kinetic stability of ultrasmall, encapsulated metal particles observed experiment.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300020

The abundance of pyridinic coordination sites in this host permits the adsorption of copper iodide from the reaction medium. The key to achieving high activity is to confine active Cu species on the surface, which is accomplished by introducing atomically dispersed metal dopants to block diffusion into the bulk of the carrier. The alternative route of incorporating metal during the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride is ineffective as Cu is thermodynamically more stable in inactive subsurface positions. A combination of X-ray absorption, X-ray photoelectron, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, density functional theory, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations is employed to determine the location and associated geometry as well as the electronic structure of metal centers. N-Arylation activity correlates to the surface coverage by copper, which varies during the reaction due to an interplay between site formation via adsorption from the reaction medium and deactivation by diffusion into the bulk of the material, and is highest when an Fe dopant is used to hinder such movement through the lattice.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300021

Exploring catalysts with high efficiency, low-cost, and high stability is an important issue for the research of heterogeneous catalysis. In recent years, researchers have prepared a variety of defective catalysts and found that the defects in catalysts have an important effect on their catalytic activity. However, the relationship between defects and catalytic activity remains to be clarified. In this Review, three aspects including recognition, understanding, and utilization for defect chemistry in heterogeneous catalysis have been proposed. Based on recent progress, this work mainly introduces the fundamental concept, types, and characterization of defects in catalysts, significant effects of defects on catalytic properties, and controllable construction methods of defects for efficient catalyst synthesis. Finally, the conclusion and outlook for the research of defect chemistry in heterogeneous catalysis are presented. It is hoped that this work can provide guidance for the controllable synthesis and mechanism research of defective heterogeneous catalysts.									44	1	0	0	5	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300023

Herein, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with ab initio FEFF calculations rule out specific adsorption of AM(+) and hydroxyl (OHad) but not interfacial water with the oxygen facing toward the Pt surface (H2O down arrow(ad)) within the hydrogen underpotential deposition (H-UPD) potential region in alkaline solutions. We further show that AM(+) greatly affects the H-UPD peaks and the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) of Pt in alkaline solutions. We accordingly propose that H2O down arrow(ad) is specifically adsorbed on undercoordinated Pt surfaces and bonded with the water molecules coordinated to AM(+), forming the sandwich structure of Pt-H2O down arrow(ad)center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) across the interface; and the exchange between the H2O down arrow(ad)center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) and Had yields the sharp H-UPD peaks. The AM(+) weakens the Pt-H2O down arrow(ad) bond via noncovalent interactions and in turn positively shifts the H-UPD peaks and hinders the HOR by delaying the oxidative removal of H-ad. The AM(+) promotes the HER of Pt by facilitating the removal of the OHad in the form of OHad center dot center dot center dot[(H2O)(x)-AM](+) subsequent to the dissociation of H2O down arrow(ad).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300024

A Theoretical Study of the Kemp Elimination Catalyzed by a Promiscuous Aldoxime Dehydratase								ACS CATALYSIS				10	19			11110	11119		10.1021/acscatal.0c02215				OCT 2 2020	2020	The design of biocatalysts is a goal to improve the rate, selectivity, and environmental friendliness of chemical processes in biotechnology. In this regard, the use of computational techniques has provided valuable assistance in the design of enzymes with remarkable catalytic activity. In this paper, hybrid QM/MM simulations have allowed getting an insight into the mechanism of a promiscuous aldoxime dehydratase (OxdA) for Kemp elimination. We first demonstrate that, based on the use of linear response approximation (LRA) methods, the lowest energy electronic state of the benzisoxazole placed in the active site of OxdA corresponds to a singlet state, the triplet and the quintet states being higher in energy. The presence of a heme group at the active site of the OxdA promiscuous enzyme opens the possibility of exploring a redox mechanism, similar to the one proposed in other reactions catalyzed by heme-dependent enzymes. In addition, according to the geometrical analysis of the active site of this aldoxime dehydratase, the presence of a good base in the active site, His320, the proper pose of the substrate assisted by the porphyrin, and an adequate electrostatic environment to stabilize the negative charge developed in the oxygen-leaving group makes available an acid/base mechanism. Comparison of the results derived from the exploration of both acid/base and redox mechanisms at the B3LYP(Def2-TZVP)/MM level shows how the latter renders the most favorable reaction path within the quintet state. The obtained activation free energy is in good agreement with the activation energy that can be deduced from the experimentally measured rate constant.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300025

As one of the most promising OER catalysts, NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can be rationally tailored via defect engineering to achieve enhanced catalytic performance. Herein, we report a fluoride precovered surface strategy to manipulate the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites of NiFe LDH catalysts. The adsorption of fluoride is introduced during the crystallization process with flexible amount, and the precovered fluoride can be easily removed by electrochemical treatment, leaving a controllable density of unsaturated metal sites with high activity toward OER. Specifically, NiFe LDH with an optimized amount of fluoride precovered demonstrates an overpotential of 243 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, with a reduced Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), exhibiting enhanced catalytic performance than pristine NiFe LDH. Such a precovered surface strategy can effectively manipulate the density of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites and has great potential in catalyst design with high performance via defect engineering.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300027

LinD is a cofactor-independent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible (de)hydration of the tertiary alcohol (S)-linalool to the triene beta-myrcene and also its isomerization to the primary alcohol geraniol. Structure-informed mutagenesis of LinD, followed by activity studies, confirmed essential roles for residues C171, C180, and H129 in water activation for the hydration of beta-myrcene to linalool. However, no evidence of covalent thioterpene intermediates was found using either X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, or QM/MM nudged elastic band simulations. Labeling and NMR experiments confirmed a role for residue D39 in (de)protonation of the linalool carbon C10 in the isomerization of linalool to geraniol and also the intermediacy of beta-myrcene in this isomerization reaction. X-ray, molecular dynamics, and activity studies also suggested a significant role in catalysis for a mobile methionine residue M125, which exists in substantially altered orientations in different mutant structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300028

Production of H-2 and NH3 was measured for CdS quantum dot (QD) MoFe protein complexes illuminated under different excitation rates. N-15-labeling of NH3 production combined with background-corrected H-2 production enabled determination of MoFe protein catalysis products. The turnover rates of H-2 and NH3 increased with excitation rate, with distinct kinetic responses that show the electron demand for NH3 requires higher excitation rates to overcome the more favored H-2 production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300029

Moreover, a series of deuterium labeling experiments, control experiments, and DFT calculations were conducted to illustrate a reasonable catalytic mechanism for this Ni-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation, which involved a tautomerization between the enamine and its isomer imine and then went through asymmetric 1,2-addition of Ni(II)-H to the preferred imine.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300030

Although they have been thoroughly studied for years, building a true enzyme mimic remains a challenging and necessary task. Here, we show how a three-dimensional geometry analysis of the key catalytic residues in natural hydrolases has been exploited to design and synthesize small-molecule artificial enzymes which mimic the active centers of chymotrypsin and N-terminal hydrolases. The optimized prototype catalyzes the methanolysis of the acyl enzyme mimic with a half-life of only 3.7 min at 20 degrees C, and it is also able to perform the transesterification of vinyl acetate at room temperature.

ACS CATALYSIS				10	19			11177	11234		10.1021/acscatal.0c01862				OCT 2 2020	2020	Water splitting through the use of (photo)electrocatalysts is a carbon-free route to sustainably produce hydrogen gas for use in various applications, such as ammonia and methanol synthesis, hydrotreating of petroleum and biomass, and clean electricity production in fuel cells. Over the past few decades, many candidate materials (e.g., metals and their oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and phosphides) in various 2D and 3D architectures and structures (e.g., layered double hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, rutiles, spinels, and perovskites) have been evaluated for catalyzing the two half-reactions involved in water splitting: hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Moreover, these materials are used under varied operating conditions, such as low and high temperatures, pressures, and solution pH, and in the presence or absence of sunlight. Accordingly, it is valuable to examine why the materials and process conditions currently in use were explored in the first place and why some of them are more promising than others. Given the difficulties associated with experimentally characterizing electrode-electrolyte interfaces in situ, theory can be a valuable partner for gaining insight into intermediate structures, reaction mechanisms, and ultimately catalyst design. Here, we focus on how theoretical studies of crucial materials properties, such as optoelectronic properties (e.g., band gaps, band edge positions, and the kinetics of charge-carrier separation and transport), adsorption and reaction energetics, and (photo)electrochemical stability, inform the success of existing and yet-to-be-discovered (photo)electrocatalysts. We also highlight other research directions important for theoretical (photo)electrocatalyst discovery, such as the quantification of reaction kinetics versus thermodynamics, investigation of the influence of defects and surface reconstructions on (photo)electrocatalytic materials properties, and the use of data science strategies (e.g., high-throughput simulations, statistical regression, and machine learning) to accelerate the development of new materials for water splitting applications.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300033

The formation of mixed-metal oxides increases the reducibility of CZ and increases the abundance of active surface oxygen. All NiO/CZ catalysts are active for methane dry reforming and retain some of their activity at a steady state. The initial methane conversion correlates linearly with the fraction of accessible Ni after reduction. The predominant path of catalyst deactivation strongly depends on the structure of the catalyst and, thus, on the synthesis method used. All catalysts experience agglomeration of Ni particles under reaction conditions. Improving the Ni dispersion to isolated species embedded in a support does not improve resistance to Ni particle growth. Coke formation is inversely related to the concentration of active surface oxygen. The dominant deactivation mechanism for catalysts made by CS is the encapsulation of Ni particles by the support.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300034

It is activated by a ligand-gated conformational change that is necessary for the enzyme to reach a catalytically competent conformation capable of efficient transition-state stabilization. While the human form (hlGPDH) has been the subject of extensive structural and biochemical studies, corresponding computational studies to support and extend experimental observations have been lacking. We perform here detailed empirical valence bond and Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type hlGPDH and its variants, as well as providing a crystal structure of the binary hlGPDH center dot NAD R269A variant where the enzyme is present in the open conformation. We estimated the activation free energies for the hydride transfer reaction in wild-type and substituted hlGPDH and investigated the effect of mutations on catalysis from a detailed structural study. In particular, the K120A and R269A variants increase both the volume and solvent exposure of the active site, with concomitant loss of catalytic activity. In addition, the R269 side chain interacts with both the Q295 side chain on the catalytic loop, and the substrate phosphodianion. Our structural data and simulations illustrate the critical role of this side chain in facilitating the closure of hlGPDH into a catalytically competent conformation, through modulating the flexibility of a key catalytic loop (292-LNGQKL-297). This, in turn, rationalizes a tremendous 41,000 fold decrease experimentally in the turnover number, k(cat), upon truncating this residue, as loop closure is essential for both correct positioning of key catalytic residues in the active site, as well as sequestering the active site from the solvent. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of this ligand-gated conformational change in catalysis, a feature that can be exploited both for protein engineering and for the design of allosteric inhibitors targeting this biomedically important enzyme.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300035	33042609

Here, a highly active and more economical composite catalyst composed of Cu-promoted Fe2O3 (nCu-Fe2O3) and HZSM-5 was developed for the selective conversion of CO2 to aromatics with 56.61% selectivity at a single pass. An extremely low CO selectivity of 3.51 at 57.30% CO2 conversion outperforming the previously reported conversion was achieved because of the beneficial synergism between Cu and Fe and the distinctive CO reduction prior to reaction which is favorable to the formation of oxygen vacancies for CO2 adsorption and iron carbide for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Additionally, through integrating HZSM-5 synthesized by the phase-transfer method (HZSM-5-pt) with nCu-Fe2O3, the distribution of benzene, toluene, and xylene in aromatics can be noteworthily increased to 54.18% and aromatics selectivity can be increased to 61.94%, without depression of catalyst activity. More significantly, a "H recycling" mechanism was found between oxide and zeolite, which plays a crucial role in "the disposal of H" within dehydrogenative aromatization, facilitating the formation of aromatics. In summary, nCu-Fe2O3/HZSM-5 demonstrates a prospective industrial application in aromatics production from CO2.Y									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300036

Herein, recent advances regarding HEA-based catalysis are systematically summarized, with a special focus on the synthetic methods for HEA-based catalysts, catalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding. Moreover, the challenges and future opportunities for this research area are carefully discussed. A series of open questions and promising directions to be explored are proposed, including synthetic methods, regulation of electronic properties, identification of active centers, and applications into photocatalysis.

A big challenge is to identify catalysts able to achieve high conversion and selectivity. Here, we report an In2O3-supported Au catalyst that exhibits excellent performance for hydrogenation of CO2 selectively to methanol. In situ characterizations using time-resolved X-ray diffraction, ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm that a strong metal-support interaction leads to a reactive Au delta+-In2O3-x interface for activation and hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. An effective gold-indium oxide bonding favors the dispersion of the noble metal and prevents its sintering under reaction conditions. The methanol selectivity reaches 100% at temperatures below 225 degrees C and is more than 70% at 275 degrees C over the Au delta+-In2O3-x catalyst. It is even 67.8% with a space time yield of methanol of 0.47 gMeOH/(h.g(cat)) at 300 degrees C, 5 MPa, and 21,000 cm(3) h(-1) g(cat)(-1). The results obtained here represent the highest selectivity and activity ever reported for CO2 hydrogenation over supported gold catalysts. Our study shows that the strong Au/In2O3 interaction and the intrinsic chemical activity of In2O3 can be used to significantly improve the catalytic performance of Au catalysts, providing promising routes for the rational design and application of Au catalysts beyond CO2 hydrogenation.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300038

Among the available CO2-recycling options, catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is the most realistic and attractive choice if the hydrogen is produced using a renewable energy source. Depending on the nature of the catalyst, CO2 hydrogenation has distinct reaction pathways, and various value-added hydrocarbons can be produced. Intense research has recently developed high-performance catalysts, identified clear reaction pathways, and deepened the understanding of the reaction mechanisms. In this review, we present an overview of recent key advances in catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to high-value hydrocarbons and oxygenates that have large market sizes, such as formic acid, methanol, methane, and light olefins, as well as liquid fuels, in terms of the catalyst design, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. In addition, the current technical challenges and perspectives on CO2 conversion processes are discussed with regard to climate change mitigation.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300039

Conventional DODH reactions usually take place at a single-site MOx (M = Re, Mo, V, etc.) active center, which proceed through a diol condensation step, an alkene extrusion step, and a catalyst regeneration (or reduction) step. Here, we suggest that MoS2-supported transition-metal atoms allow for the DODH reaction to occur through an alternative mechanism, whereby the C-H bond of a diol is activated first, which facilitates the C-OH bond cleavage on a neighboring carbon. The removal of the second OH group is also facile over the proposed catalysts. Our kinetic studies suggest that the DODH of ethylene glycol on Ru-2/MoS2, Ir-2/MoS2, and Ru-3/MoS2 is highly active with predicted turnover frequencies of over 1/s. Thus, our study suggests a possible approach for the design of highly active DODH catalysts. Apart from being a DODH catalyst, the proposed MoS2-supported catalysts are also highly active as the hydrodeoxygenation catalyst for the removal of alcohol OH groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300040

Herein, the active sites for low-temperature CO oxidation are elucidated over single-atom Pd-1/CeO2 catalysts prepared via high-temperature atom trapping (AT). The increased oxygen vacancies on CeO2 surface induced by 800 degrees C air calcination result in decreased Pd-CeO2 coordinations, i.e., the coordination-unsaturated Pd2+ on CeO2. Light-off and light-out measurements coupled with CO-DRIFTS and X-ray absorption characterization confirm that these coordination-unsaturated Pd2+ on CeO2 are much more reactive than the fully coordinated counterpart, evidenced by a decrease of T-90 (temperature to achieve 90% conversion) by similar to 100 degrees C in CO oxidation at a gas hourly space velocity of 300 L g(-1) h(-1).									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300041

A bifunctional nickel, iron-nanomesh array electrocatalyst has been developed characteristic of excellent structural features for favorable NRR and OER processes, including highly exposed active sites originated from sub-nanometer-thick nanomeshes, hierarchical porosity resulting from the array-arranged nanolayers, and binary nickel, iron active sites. The electrode demonstrates excellent NRR activity with an ammonia yield of 16.89 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.50% at -350 mV (vs RHE), in addition to OER activity with a small overpotential of 191 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). Consequently, a full N-2 electrolysis system has been constructed that exhibits remarkable ammonia production performance with an ammonia yield of 2.07 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) at 1.9 V, an FE of 9.87% at 1.6 V, and good durability for 30 h. Further mechanism study through density function theory shows that the NRR proceeds via an associative distal pathway, whereas the free energies for the N-2* -> NNH* intermediate step in the NRR as well as the OH* + H2O -> O* + H2O intermediate step in the OER can be reduced by tuning the catalysts electronic structure by the strong synergistic effect between nickel and iron.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300043

To overcome this challenge, in this study, we designed and prepared a nanoparticulate (Pd1-xPtx)In pseudobinary alloy using Al2O3 and CeO2 supports, where a portion of Pd was replaced with Pt to improve the oxidation tolerance of In during NOx reduction under lean conditions. Multiple characterization techniques were used to confirm the formation of the desired pseudobinary alloy phase. The prepared Pd-Pt-In/CeO2 catalyst exhibited high NO conversion to N-2 in NO-CO-O-2 reaction with a wide range of oxygen concentrations including lean conditions (80%-100%, 0.75 <= lambda <= 1.5, 350 degrees C) and retained its catalytic performance during rich-lean cycles.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300044

A Pd(II) complex 1 featuring aPmic catalyzes the oxidation of a wide range of terminal olefins to the corresponding methyl ketones in good to excellent yields in acetonitrile. The catalytic reaction is proposed to proceed via syn-peroxypalladation and a subsequent rate-limiting 1,2-hydride shift, which is supported by kinetic studies. The electronic asymmetry of aPmic renders a well-defined coordination sphere at Pd. The favored arrangement of reactants on the metal center features an olefin trans to the pyridyl module and a tbutylperoxide trans to the carbene. This arrangement gains added stability by the pi-delocalization paved by the compatible orbitals on Pd, the pyridyl module, and the olefin that is perpendicular to the Pd(aPmic) plane. The pi-interactions are absent in an alternate arrangement wherein the olefin is trans to the carbene. Density functional theory studies reveal the matching orbital overlaps responsible for the preferred arrangement over the other. This work provides an orbital description for the electronic asymmetry of aPmic.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300045

A general and also strong "axial oxy group effect" was now observed with benzoyl cyanide as the acylating agent and 4-dimethylaminopyridine as the catalyst, permitting the preferred O-acylation of equatorial hydroxy groups next to axial oxy groups. This effect is substantiated with 2,3-O-unprotected beta-D-galacto- and alpha-D-glucopyranosides and 3,4-O-unprotected mannopyranosides possessing vicinal trans-diol moieties. Moreover, vicinal trans-diols with axial oxy groups next to each hydroxy group, possessing expectedly comparable reactivity, could be differentiated with chiral tertiary amine catalysts. Particularly interesting in this regard is the action of bifunctional (S,S)-N-(N,N-dialkylaminocyclohexyl)-thioureas as catalysts; they favor 2-O-benzoylation of 2,3-O-unprotected alpha-galactopyranosides, as is also supported by density functional theory calculations. This directing effect can be reversed with quinidine as the catalyst or with bulky substituents at the anomeric position.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300048

Herein, we report a remarkable achievement of both hydrogen generation activity and durability by atomically engineering Pt-PdO interfacial sites. A combination of kinetics (isotopic) analyses, multiple characterization techniques, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculations was employed to reveal the evolution of the Pt-Pd atomic structure where Pd segregates to the outer surface of Pt nanoparticles, followed by partial oxidation, resulting in the structure of a Pt-rich core and a PdO-Pd-rich shell. The strong capability of PdO to activate H2O compensates for its adverse effects on Pt electronic properties and creates the Pt and PdO interfacial sites for ammonia borane and H2O activation, respectively. Moreover, because of the strong electron repulsion and steric hindrance effects, these surface PdO sites strongly inhibit the adsorption of B(OH)(4)(-), thus protecting Pt active sites from poisoning. As a result, such a unique atomic structure with a Pt-Pd ratio of 1:1 is found to be the most promising catalyst at the apex of the volcano curve. The strategy developed here unambiguously clarifies the activity and durability attributes of Pt-PdO interfacial sites for this reaction and sheds light on the design of a new type of highly active yet stable metal catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300049

Radical conjugate addition provides an avenue for replacing reactive nucleophiles with convenient radical precursors. Carboxylic acids can serve as simple and stable radical precursors by way of decarboxylation, but activation to reactive esters is typically necessary to facilitate the challenging decarboxylation. Here, we report a direct, dual-catalytic decarboxylative radical conjugate addition of a wide range of carboxylic acids that does not require acid preactivation and is enabled by the visible light-driven acridine photocatalysis interfaced with an efficient copper catalytic cycle. Mechanistic and computational studies provide insights into the roles of the ligands and metal species in the dual-catalytic process and the photocatalytic activity of substituted acridines.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300052

We focus on two unexplored/"gray" events: (a) the O-2 entrance and binding to form the oxyferrous species as a function of the O-2 concentration/pressure and (b) the protonation steps that eventually lead to the formation of the ultimate active species, compound I (cf. 7). Two fundamental and paradigm-shifting findings emerge: (a) the O-2 concentration/pressure required for O-2 binding must be neither high nor low. The binding is ushered by substrate choreography, which is guided by the moderate O-2 pressure and strategic protein residues (Arg112 and Phe87) that block the substrate approach to the heme, thus enabling O-2 accumulation near iron. (b) The formation of water channels, which elicit that the protonation steps are different for 5 -> 6 and 6 -> 7. The process 5. 6, generating the ferric hydroperoxide, occurs via the channels that are formed by breakage of the salt bridges holding the propionate side chains of the porphyrin, while the formation of compound I, 6 -> 7, transpires via the traditional acid-alcohol pairs (Asp251/Thr252 in CAM; Glu267/Thr268 in BM3). The location of acidic ammonium groups (Lys69 in CYP450(BM3) and Arg299 in CYP450(CAM)) near the propionate side chains is generally conserved in the CYP450 family. Therefore, our study highlights the evolutionary need for at least two alternative water channels to tune the P450 nanomachine, so it can complete the two steps of the protonation and form ultimately compound I.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300055

In this work, four CeO2 supports with structurally well-defined different shapes and crystal facets are hydrothermally prepared, and their effects on the composition of Pd species and oxygen vacancy over Pd/CeO2 catalysts have been intensively investigated in the reduction of CO2 to methanol. The 2Pd/CeO2-R (rods) shows the highest concentration and number of oxygen vacancies, where the (110) facet with high surface oxygen mobility and low oxygen vacancy formation energy is exposed over the CeO2-R surface. The oxygen mobility at the interface of (111) and (100) facets mainly observed on 2Pd/CeO2-P (polyhedrons) is higher than the single (111) and (100) facets mainly observed on 2Pd/CeO2-O (octahedrons) and 2Pd/CeO2-C (cubs), respectively. The presence of Pd highly promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies by providing dissociated H atoms to facilitate the removal of surface O in ceria support under a H-2 atmosphere. Both the PdxCe1-xO delta solid solution dominated on CeO2-R and the PdO species dominated on CeO2-O are reduced to metallic Pd after reduction with 6-10 nm average particle size. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in contrast to the single Pd-0 atom on CeO2 and the thermodynamically most unstable PdxCe1-xO delta solid solution, the Pd-0 nanoparticles are the most stable species under the realistic reaction conditions. The 2Pd/CeO2-R shows the highest catalytic activity as the abundantly available oxygen vacancies function as CO2 adsorption and activation sites. Moreover, oxygen vacancy reactivity is correlated with its formation energy. The lower formation energy facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancy; however, the reactivity of each oxygen vacancy is lower as the TOFoxygen vacancy of 2Pd/CeO2-O is 15 times as that of 2Pd/CeO2-R. Thus, a suitable oxygen vacancy formation energy is likely favorable for enhancing CO2 reactivity. DFT calculations indicate that the CH3OH formation is most probably from the formate (HCOO*) pathway via the C-O bond cleavage in H2COOH*, with the reduction of HCOO* to HCOOH* as the rate-limiting step. These results would provide experimental and theoretical insights into the rational design of an effective catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation.									27	2	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300056

Using advanced spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and electrochemically active surface area characterization techniques, the electronic structure and the changes in the morphology/roughness of thermally oxidized copper thin films were revealed during CO2RR. For this purpose, we developed an in situ cell for X-ray spectroscopy that could be operated accurately in the presence of gases or liquids to clarify the role of the initial thermal oxide phase and its active phase during the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. It was found that the Cu(I) species formed during the thermal treatment are readily reduced to Cu-0 during the CO2RR, whereas Cu(II) species are hardly reduced. In addition, Cu(II) oxide electrode dissolution was found to yield a porous/void structure, where the lack of electrical connection between isolated islands prohibits the CO2RR. Therefore, the active/stable phase for CO2RR is metallic copper, independent of its initial phase, with a significant change in its morphology upon its reduction yielding the formation of a rougher surface with a higher number of underco-ordinated sites. Thus, the initial thermal oxidation of copper in air controls the reaction activity/selectivity because of the changes induced in the electrode surface morphology/roughness and the presence of more undercoordinated sites during the CO2RR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300057	33042610

This method uses RhCl3 salt as the catalyst precursor and avoids the use of co-oxidants such as Cu(II). The use of dioxygen as the in situ oxidant gives water as the only byproduct of the alkenylation reaction. Conditions to achieve >1000 turnovers of alkenyl benzene products have been developed. As the catalysis progresses, oxidation of styrene product to form benzaldehyde becomes competitive. Compared to the Rh catalysis using Cu(II) oxidants, the aerobic reactions give decreased reaction rate and reduced anti-Markovnikov/Markovnikov selectivity when using alpha-olefins. For styrene formation, the reaction rate shows a first-order dependence on catalyst concentration, ethylene concentration (with saturation at higher ethylene concentrations), and dioxygen. An intermolecular kinetic isotope effect value of 2.7(6) was determined from parallel reactions with C6H6 versus C6D6. Synthesis of trans-stilbene and pentenyltoluenes has been demonstrated using this Rh-catalyzed aerobic alkenylation reaction.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300058

In this study, we investigated in detail the role of the Cu-CeO2 interactions for methanol synthesis, emphasizing the role of the copper surface and interface sites between copper and ceria for the hydrogenation of CO2 and CO. A combined CO2-N2O titration approach was developed to quantify the exposed metallic copper sites and ceria oxygen vacancies in reduced Cu/CeO2 catalysts. Extensive characterization shows that copper dispersion is strongly enhanced by strong Cu-CeO2 interactions in comparison to Cu/SiO2. CO2 hydrogenation activity data show that the Cu/CeO2 catalysts displayed higher methanol selectivity compared to a reference Cu/SiO2 catalyst. The improved methanol selectivity stems from inhibition of the reverse water-gas-shift activity. The role of CO in CO2-to-methanol conversion was studied by steady-state and transient cofeeding activity measurements together with (quasi) in situ characterization (TPH, XPS, SSITKA, and IR spectroscopy). The Cu-CeO2 interface provides active sites for the direct hydrogenation of CO to methanol via a formyl intermediate. Cofeeding of small amounts of CO2 to a CO/H-2 mixture poisons these interfacial sites due to the formation of carbonate-like species. Methanol synthesis proceeds mainly via CO2 hydrogenation in which the metallic Cu surface provides the active sites.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300059

Herein, we investigate the regeneration of Sn-containing zeolites for the continuous conversion of glucose. In doing so, we reveal that permanent changes to the properties of the catalyst occur following continuous operation and regeneration, resulting in surprising improvements to performance during subsequent operational cycles. Through a combination of characterization (Sn-119 CPMG MAS NMR, DRIFTS, and vapor sorption) and kinetic methodologies, we reveal that improved performance arises from restructuring of the catalyst, which causes the active-site environment to become more accessible, more hydrophobic, more reactive, and more stable. Based on these findings, we demonstrate how these positive changes can be emulated without resorting to extended operation, by optimizing pretreatment of the catalyst prior to reaction. This process, termed preactivation, involves treatment of the fresh catalyst in a flow of methanol at 110 degrees C for 0.5 h, prior to its heat treatment at 550 degrees C in air for 3 h. This relatively rapid procedure allows substantial improvements to catalyst activity and stability to be achieved in a permanent fashion prior to the first operational cycle.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300060

Within this realm, 80% of reactions are carried out by heterogeneous catalysts due to their advantageous physical and chemical characteristics. In some heterogeneous systems, the reaction rate can be optimized through rational catalyst design, in which support materials can be tailored structurally and stereoelectronically for targeted purposes to better facilitate the catalytic reaction. To this end, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered recent attention due to their high porosity, crystallinity, and chemical tunability, which can be used to derive structure-activity relationships in the design of catalysts. In this Perspective, we survey examples of catalytically active guest metals on the inorganic nodes of MOFs. This is done with the intention of providing design guidelines for tailoring chemical reactivity and insights into the opportunities for future growth in this field. Strategies for rational design in MOF catalysis include electronic tuning of the metal node in the MOF support, installing promoter ions onto the node to effect the reactivity of grafted metals, modulation of the spatial environment around the transition metal using the metal node structure, and achieving site uniformity in supported catalysts. By highlighting these efforts, we seek to underscore the role of MOF nodes as nonspectator supports for catalytic metal complexes and provide future directions for rational catalyst design by tuning reactivity on these anchoring platforms.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300061

Alkoxyiminium chlorides and hexafluorophosphates were synthesized and characterized as a key intermediate of the catalytic cycle. The determination of reaction orders and control experiments indicated that the nucleophilic attack of the formamide catalyst onto the reagent BzCl is the rate-determining step. Linear free energy relationship revealed a correlation between the quantified Lewis basicity strength of formamides by means of B-11 NMR spectroscopy and their catalytic activity in S-N-transformations. The observed difference in catalytic ability was attributed to the natural bond order charge, dipole moment, and Sterimol parameter B-5. Importantly, this rationalization enables the prediction of the capacity of formamides to promote S-N-type transformations in general.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300062

However, the design and synthesis of high-performance nonprecious metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction are still confronted with challenges because of their high overpotential and poor flexibility. We herein reported in situ formed bimetallic carbide Ni6Mo6C nanodot and NiMoOx nanosheet array hybrid electrocatalyst supported on activated carbon cloth (Ni6Mo6C/NiMoOx/ACC), which is manufactured by controlling the diffusion of carbon atoms into precursor NiMoO4 nanosheets from activated carbon cloth to produce active species bimetallic carbide during annealing in a H-2 atmosphere. The unique hierarchical structure of NiMoOx nanosheet arrays grown on ACC could significantly promote both mass transport and electric conductivity, and the embedded Ni6Mo6C with moderated hydrogen adsorption ability (Delta GH* = -0.13 eV) and low water dissociation barrier (Delta Gb = 0.27 eV) exhibited remarkable performance and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Optimal Ni6Mo6C/NiMoOx/ACC demonstrates zero onset overpotential and an overpotential of only 29 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability (60 h loss-free continuous operation) in 1.0 M KOH solution, even surpassing the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Especially, the as-made electrocatalyst shows robust flexibility and its high electrocatalytic performance almost keeps constant under distorted states, thus meeting the requirements of flexible electrocatalysts such as bendability. These findings afford a new idea to integrally construct highly efficient flexible electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300065

Effective utilization of biomass requires reductive upgrading of the raw carbon-oxygenates to more valuable compounds. Electroreductive coupling offers a promising strategy for this upgrading by reducing the oxygenated functional groups and increasing molecular weight through C-C bond formation. Despite this promise, elctroreductive coupling suffers from a lack of fundamental understanding. In particular, the cross-coupling of different species remains poorly understood. In this work, the electroreductive coupling of benzaldehyde and furfural on Cu and Pb electrodes is investigated. Reactivity studies show both self-coupling and cross-coupling of the two aldehydes on these two metal surfaces, but with different selectivities. Cu shows greater selectivity for cross-coupling, whereas Pb favors furfural coupling. Comparison with a stochastic model suggests that both metals deviate from stochastic coupling control, with greater deviation on Pb, likely due to a larger difference in aldehyde binding energies. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and in situ spectroscopy further support stronger benzaldehyde adsorption compared to furfural on both metals, with a larger difference in binding energy for Pb. Combined, the reactivity, CV, and spectroscopy experiments suggest that cross-coupling of the two aldehydes follows a two reactant Sabatier rule, with optimum cross-coupling for electrodes and similar reactant binding energies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300066

The octahedral ruthenium complex [Ru(acac)(2)(pyimN)] ((RuN)-N-III 3) is shown to abstract a hydrogen atom from the ruthenium hydride [RuH(CNN)(dppb)] (RuH 2, CNN = 2-aminomethyl-6-tolylpyridine, dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)-butane) to generate [Ru(acac)2(pyimNH)] ((RuNH4)-N-II) and a reduced Ru(CNN)(dppb) complex. As (RuN3)-N-III can be electrochemically regenerated from (RuNH4)-N-II under appropriately basic and oxidizing conditions, we envisioned using (RuN)-N-III 3 as a suitable electrochemically regenerable hydrogen atom acceptor in a tandem electrocatalytic cycle to reduce the overpotential for electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation by 450 mV. In the presence of a strong base, the previously reported alcohol oxidation electrocatalyst [RuX(CNN)(dppb)] (1, X = Cl, 2, X = H) catalyzes the oxidation of isopropanol to acetone with a turnover frequency (TOF) greater than 3 s(-1) at -0.70 V versus ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc(+/0)) in tetrahydrofuran. Upon adding (RuNH)-N-II 4, RuCl 1 electrocatalytically oxidizes isopropanol to acetone at -1.20 V versus Fc(+/0) in tetrahydrofuran with a TOF of ca. 1 s(-1). Cyclic voltammetry and chemical hydrogen atom transfer studies suggest that the predominant electrocatalytic pathway involves hydrogen atom abstraction from RuH 2 by electrochemically generated (RuN)-N-III 3.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300067

In this study, we chose iron and nickel phosphides as model catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to elucidate the alloying effect of FexNi2-xP (x = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5), which has the same P (6) over bar 2m crystal structure with different alloy compositions. The Fe0.5Ni1.5P catalyst recorded the optimal HER performances, including small overpotential (0.163 V at 50 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1)), and high exchange current density (0.37 mA cm(-2)), which were superior to pure Ni2P, Fe2P, and other FexNi2-xP catalysts in acidic media. The charge of phosphorus atoms in Fe0.5Ni1.5P was proven the most deficient one by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data supported that the small distortion degree of the metal-metal (M-M) bonds in the Fe0.5Ni1.5P significantly suppresses the metal to phosphorus (M-to-P) charge transfer and increases the electronic deficiency of phosphorus atoms. We also performed the density functional theory (DFT) calculation to support our charge trend of phosphorus and local distortion of M-to-P bonds. Our finding provided the observation of electron-deficient phosphorus sites modulated by the alloy composition of FexNi2-xP and showed how the degree of the M-M bond distortion correlates with HER properties in acidic media.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300069

In this future energy scenario, the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is a pivotal process for onsite hydrogen production and/or electricity generation. However, its implementation is hindered by the nondurable nature of AOR catalysis by platinum. Accordingly, securement of a durable Pt electrocatalysis for the AOR is critical but has been hampered by the well-known chemical deactivation (i.e., poisoning). Additionally, the structural stability, which could also affect durable AOR operation, has scarcely been investigated. Herein, the degradation of Pt catalysts under AOR conditions has been investigated with various operando and in/ex situ spectroscopies. We demonstrate that NH3 (or AOR intermediates/byproducts) modifies the chemical structures of both the Pt surface and dissolved Pt ions, specifically by passivation of the Pt surface with NH3-derived adsorbates and complexation of the dissolved Pt ions, respectively. These modifications lead to a significant acceleration in Pt dissolution but a deceleration in its redeposition, resulting in the augmented structural degradation of Pt catalysts in NH3-containing electrolyte after the Pt has experienced a potential excursion above ca. 1 VRHE. With these understandings, a quasi-stable operation potential window and operational strategy are suggested. The tentative AOR protocol allows prolonged NH3 electrolysis with alleviated Pt dissolution (<0.02 ng cm(Pt)(-2) s(-1)), suggesting that NH3 will be a viable future energy carrier if the rational operational strategy proposed herein is developed further.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300070

Here, a highly active diruthenium complex based on the bis(bipyridyl)pyrazolate (bbp(-)) ligand scaffold is anchored on electronically conducting multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using a pyrene group attached to either the pyrazolate backbone (2) or to multiple axial ligand positions (1). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) show the presence of >75% sp(2) hybridization of the MWCNTs and an increase of spectral weight of pi-pi* transitions upon immobilization of the pyrene-modified ligand or diruthenium complex, supporting pyrene anchoring via pi-pi interactions. Upon electrochemical oxidation the pyrene groups confined to the MWCNT-modified electrodes are rapidly converted to redox-active surface-bound quinone species. The water oxidation performance of the hybrid systems is studied by cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments under acidic aqueous condition (triflic acid, pH 1). Whereas the complex anchored at the backbone position shows higher initial catalytic activity, the complex anchored via four axial ligand positions features a higher stability. X-ray photoemission (XPS) data before and after electrochemical measurements reveal that the chemical structure of the immobilized complex remains intact under catalytic conditions. The results suggest that anchoring of Ru-2 complexes by differently located pyrene groups on MWCNTs offers good performance for electron transfer, however, a single pyrene group at the pyrazolate backbone does not provide sufficiently strong surface attachment. The distinct experimental results for MWCNT hybrids with anchored 1 and 2 are further discussed in terms of the preferred attachment position at the pyrazolate-based Ru-2 scaffold and the orientation of the catalyst's active site with respect to the supporting surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200033

These catalysts showed remarkable catalytic efficiencies (turnover numbers of 100,000 for ethenolysis and 200,000 for propenolysis) and excellent alpha-olefin selectivity (up to 99%). A computational study indicated that the energy barrier of the beta-hydride elimination pathway in the presence of a phosphine-copper cocatalyst is higher than that in the absence of the cocatalyst, which might contribute to the improved longevity of the ruthenium catalyst in the reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200031

However, the lack of an in-depth understanding of its intrinsic defect properties limits further improvement of its performance. In this study, comprehensive spectroscopic characterizations are combined with theoretical calculations to investigate the defect properties of Ta3N5. The obtained electronic structure of Ta3N5 reveals that oxygen impurities are shallow donors, while nitrogen vacancies and reduced Ta centers (Ta3+) are deep traps. The Ta3+ defects are identified to be most detrimental to the water splitting performance because their energetic position lies below the water reduction potential. Based on these findings, a simple H2O2 pretreatment method is employed to improve the PEC performance of the Ta3N5 photoanode by reducing the concentration of Ta3+ defects, resulting in a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 2.25%. The fundamental knowledge about the defect properties of Ta3N5 could serve as a guideline for developing more efficient photoanodes and photocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200001

Nevertheless, producing liquid hydrocarbons with a single catalyst without utilizing additional C-C coupling agents remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional iron aluminum oxide (FeAlOx) catalyst that directly converts CO2 into C5+ hydrocarbons with an overall selectivity of 77.0% and CO2 conversion of 20.2% at a H-2/CO2 ratio of 1:1. Notably, the selectivity for linear alpha-olefins (LAOs) was 52.4%, accounting for 78.4% of the total C4+ olefins. At a high H-2/CO2 ratio of 3:1, the yield of C5+ hydrocarbons was 19.7%. The concept of crystalline-/amorphous-structured active sites in the single FeAlOx catalyst was proposed. The reducible magnetite (Fe3O4) phase, which contains surface oxygen vacancies, facilitated the reverse-water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction to form CO via CO2 hydrogenation, and subsequent C-C coupling over Hagg iron carbide afforded lower olefins (C2-C4(=)). Long-chain LAOs were then formed on the surface of amorphous aluminum oxide (AlOx) via the readsorption of (C-2-C-4(=)). In addition, the amorphous AlOx phase enhanced CO2 and H-2 adsorption, which facilitated the formation of carbonate, bicarbonate, and formate species via the RWGS reaction and the subsequent formation of long-chain hydrocarbons via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. The bifunctional FeAlOx catalyst showed excellent stability for up to 450 h onstream, demonstrating its potential as a practical-scale catalyst for the conversion of CO2 into value-added liquid fuels and chemicals.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200002

Here, we report variedly sized Pd nanoparticles (NPs) (2.1-10.4 nm) on gamma-alumina by a one-step colloid synthesis method for stoichiometric methane combustion. The results of structural analysis based on transmission electron microscopy and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy show that, with increasing size, Pd NPs evolve their shape from irregular to spherical-like structure along with a progressively decreased fraction of Pd corner sites. Moreover, the intrinsic catalytic activity (turnover frequency) of Pd NPs for methane combustion monotonously decreases by about 6-fold when the size of Pd NPs increases from 2.1 to 10.4 nm, suggestive of a protuberant size-dependent activity of Pd catalyst in this reaction. Further confirmed by the potential energy profiles of the rate-determining step in the reaction from density functional theory calculations, the methane molecule is much easier to be activated on corner sites than on the other sites (i.e., edge and terrace sites) over Pd NPs. This work elucidates the origin of size-dependent activity of Pd catalysts via an investigation on their surface structure and could help to engineer highly efficient catalysts for this reaction.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200003

Detailed characterizations reveal that the support shape effect of Pt/CeO2 catalysts on nitrobenzene hydrogenation originates from the exposed crystal planes on CeO2 with different reducibilities. A high-energy surface is readily reduced to generate more Ce3+ surface sites and oxygen vacancies, not only favoring the dispersion and stabilization of Pt species due to stronger metal-support interaction but also providing more adsorption sites for reactants and intermediates. Reduction treatment at high temperatures has been proved to be an effective way to improve the performance of Pt/CeO2 catalysts by providing additional Ce3+ surface sites and high H-spillover capability. The additional Ce3+ far away from Pt, derived from a high-temperature reduction, can adsorb the N-phenylhydroxylamine intermediate more effectively due to its stronger electron-donating ability and in turn promote aniline formation. It is also found that Na ions with suitable content facilitate the generation and stabilization of surface Ce3+ by charge transfer and help Pt particles to maintain a smaller size. Consequently, a 0.25 wt % Pt catalyst, supported on Na-containing CeO2 nanorods and reduced at 600 degrees C, displays a high level of aniline productivity of 40.8 molAN/gPt/h and excellent stability in nitrobenzene hydrogenation at room temperature. A pathway of nitrobenzene hydrogenation catalyzed by Pt/CeO2 is also proposed.									13	1	0	0	2	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200004

However, the development of efficient light-harvesting and photocatalytic systems remains a significant challenge because of scarcity of low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts in CO2 conversion. Herein, a tunable selectivity in photothermal CO2 conversion was demonstrated over a series of Fe-based catalysts developed through a simple hydrogenation/carbonization treatment with commercial Fe3O4 as a precursor. The Fe3O4 catalyst demonstrated a full selectivity toward CO (about 100%) and 11.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1) activity for the photothermal catalytic conversion of CO2. More importantly, the purephase theta-Fe3C produced remarkably high selectivity toward hydrocarbon products (>97%) and superior activity (10.9 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) in the photothermal conversion of CO2. Meanwhile, it is found that the selectivity toward a hydrocarbon (CHx) can be modulated by the extent of hydrogenation/carbonization of the Fe3O4 precursor. In addition, we demonstrated the vital influence of the nonthermal effect on the enhanced catalytic performance with the Fe-based catalysts during the photothermal conversion of CO2.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200005

Nevertheless, O-demethylation of aryl methyl ethers is a tool to valorize natural and pharmaceutical compounds by deprotecting reactive hydroxyl moieties. Various oxidative enzymes are known to catalyze this reaction at the expense of molecular oxygen, which may lead in the case of phenols/catechols to undesired side reactions (e.g., oxidation, polymerization). Here an oxygen-independent demethylation via methyl transfer is presented employing a cobalamin-dependent veratrol-O-demethylase (vdmB). The biocatalytic demethylation transforms a variety of aryl methyl ethers with two functional methoxy moieties either in 1,2-position or in 1,3-position. Biocatalytic reactions enabled, for instance, the regioselective monodemethylation of substituted 3,4-dimethoxy phenol as well as the monodemethylation of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene. The methyltransferase vdmB was also successfully applied for the regioselective demethylation of natural compounds such as papaverine and rac-yatein. The approach presented here represents an alternative to chemical and enzymatic demethylation concepts and allows performing regioselective demethylation in the absence of oxygen under mild conditions, representing a valuable extension of the synthetic repertoire to modify pharmaceuticals and diversify natural products.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200006	32974079

Herein, a compartmentalization method involving the integration of a cocatalyst system has been developed, which enables an efficient Michael addition/reduction enantioselective dual-catalysis process to be accomplished from a noncompatible system. In this process, the chiral squaramide species is encapsulated within the cavity of one hollow-shellmesostructured silica support, whereas the chiral organoruthenium/diamine species is entrapped within the cavity of another watersoluble thermoresponsive polymer-coating hollow-shell-mesostructured silica support. This shielding feature together with the reversible on-off mode of the water-soluble thermoresponsive polymer not only controls the cross-interactions of dual species but also harmonizes the reaction conditions. As we envisioned, the one-pot sequential Michael addition of alpha-nitrosulfone and enones followed by asymmetric transfer hydrogenation provides various 1,4-distereocentered chiral delta-hydroxysulfones with enhanced yields and enantio/diastereoselectivities.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200007

Two clear structural changes were observed as the temperature was increased from 25 to 500 degrees C in the presence of H-2(g): the first involved nucleation of nanoscale Ni-rich particles and the second involved general collapse of the remaining oxide phase along with substantial coarsening of the alloy particles. The activity of the catalyst toward alkaline hydrogen evolution was found to reach a maximum in a narrow range of reduction temperatures from 375 to 425 degrees C. This resulted in the formation of a mixed-phase product comprising sub-10 nm Ni0.9Mo0.1 particles embedded in a porous Mo-rich oxide matrix. Thus, the most active Ni-Mo catalyst apparently requires intimate contact between the alloy component and the oxide phase, lending support to a catalytic mechanism involving metallic and oxidized surface sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200008

Electrocatalyst supports based on tantalum-doped tin oxide (Ta/SnO2) were prepared by electrospinning. The dopant amount was varied between 0 (undoped SnO2) and 7.5 at. %, and the resulting materials were characterized for their morphology, composition, structure, porosity, and electrical properties. Platinum nanoparticles prepared by a microwave-assisted polyol method were deposited with different loadings on 1 at. % Ta-doped SnO2 (1Ta/SnO2), selected for its highest electrical conductivity of 0.09 S cm(-1). Their electrocatalytic properties toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were compared with those of the same particles deposited on carbon black and those of a commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst. Pt/1Ta/SnO2 showed higher ORR activity and stability at high potential than Pt/C. In particular, the electrocatalyst with the lowest Pt loading (7 wt %) presented high mass activity and stability which, from XPS analysis, is suggested to result from very strong metal-support interaction. These results indicate that amongst tin oxides doped with pentavalent metals such as niobium (Nb/SnO2), antimony (Sb/SnO2), and tantalum, Ta/SnO2 has the advantage of both higher conductivity than Nb/SnO2 and greater stability in the fuel cell voltage range than Sb/SnO2.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200009

Here, we present the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into C-2 products such as ethylene and ethanol with high selectivity using a self-assembled cuprous coordination polymer nanoparticle (Cu-SCP). The features of the Cu-SCP catalyst are the arrangement of Cu atoms in close proximity, similar to that in metallic Cu, and a stable Cu(I) oxidation state throughout the reaction due to the coordination of ligands with Cu atoms, which inhibits conversion into Cu metal particles. The Cu-SCP also exhibits activity for C-2 production that is superior to that of a Cu metal electrode, without modification of the carbon particles and/or ionomers or continuous flow of the highly alkaline electrolyte, which will simplify the fabrication of a CO2 electrolyzer. The Cu-SCP can be synthesized by a facile process that utilizes a heterogeneous reaction, and the product selectivity can be changed by replacement of the organic ligands, which should open up possibilities for the design of other CO2 reduction catalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200010

However, the kinetic features required for efficient turnover of a process where "multiple transformations are effected by a single catalytic mechanism" have not been explored in any detail. The kinetics of a nominally simple two-stage domino catalytic reaction have been analyzed by way of a gold-catalyzed coupling of two electron-deficient arylsilanes to generate an arylated fluorene. A combination of in situ interleaved H-1 and F-19 NMR spectroscopic kinetic measurements, kinetic simulations, and variations in substitution reveal how the catalyst partitioning between the two different cycles impacts both the rate and the selectivity of the process. The insight enables identification that sequential catalyst speciation and accumulation of the domino intermediate are general kinetic criteria for efficient domino catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200011

We present a rational tuning of the hole-accumulation and hole-transfer ability of a catalyst by in situ deposition of IrOx on NiOx islands on model Si electrodes and we demonstrate a distinct hole accumulation behavior during the OER through electrochemical methods, in situ UV-vis and Raman spectroelectrochemistry. We find that the NiOx islands with <10% coverage on an n++-Si dark electrode demonstrate a 6-fold higher capacity of hole accumulation relative to that on an n-Si photoanode under illumination. A further in situ targeted deposition of soluble hexahydroxyiridate on the NiOx leads to the formation of NiOx/IrOx junctions, where the IrOx further depletes the extracted holes by NiOx from the n-Si photoanode decreasing the overpotential by similar to 260 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), yet the IrOx promotes the hole accumulation at the NiOx/IrOx on the dark electrodes presenting a similar decrease of the overpotential. In contrast to the dark-holes, an extremely lower charging level of photogenerated holes of the same catalyst at the identical current density reasoned a seemingly higher reactivity to drive the OER, and reasonably demonstrated a stronger oxidation/ corrosion to the Si electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200012

The functional dependence of the rate of each of these reactions was determined by observing the transient rate after a step-change in reactant partial pressures, specifically whether the rate was discontinuous through a step-change in partial pressure. Steady-state isotopic switching experiments revealed that a persistent surface intermediate with two aromatic rings, likely DPM+, is formed and has a fractional coverage ranging from sparse (near-zero) to complete (nearone) that varies with process conditions. Reaction orders obtained from steady-state rate measurements suggest that HCHO, C6H6, and H2O competitively adsorb on acid sites and that DPM+ deprotonation is first-order in C6H6, implying that deprotonation is assisted by the presence of aromatics. Herein, we propose a complete mechanism for the condensation between HCHO and C6H6 to form DPM, and from this mechanism, a six-parameter (three kinetic/thermodynamic parameters, three apparent activation/thermodynamic energies) kinetic model is derived that quantitatively describes the transient and steady-state rates and steady-state fractional coverages of DPM+.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200013

Here, we have shown the electronic tuning of Ni by Mo species anchored on SAPO-11 (Ni-Mo/S-11) enabling the high-efficient hydroisomerization of n-alkanes comparable to commercial Pt/S-11, which is of great importance in producing fuel oils. The well-dispersed Ni particles intimately contacted with MoO2 are anchored on S-11 based on a vacuum-assisted route. There is the obvious presence of electron transfer from Mo species to Ni due to the intimate contact, which can increase the electron density around Ni and consequently promote H activation and desorption on Ni catalyst. Also, the good dispersion of Ni-Mo species on S-11 is favorable to expose more Bronsted acid sites of S-11, being responsible for the skeletal isomerization. These characteristics endow enhanced activity of 3.0Ni-0.5Mo/S-11 for the hydroisomerization of n-hexadecane with a high isomer yield of 81.4%, being comparable to 81.0% for 0.5 wt % Pt/S-11. The analysis of products showed similar isomerization and cracking mechanisms over 3.0Ni-0.5Mo/S-11 catalyst to Pt catalyst. Further, the presence of Mo species can enhance the stability, with no obvious change after 100 h continuous catalytic reaction. Both the catalytic activity and stability are much superior to those of monometallic Ni/S-11 and the reported non-noble-metal catalyst. This work focuses on developing high-effective non-noble-metal-based catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200014

A molecular-level understanding of intermediate structures created during catalysis is essential for developing high-performance bimetal catalysts. We show that intermediate Pt-NiO1-x interfacial structures drive the catalytic synergistic effect observed on Pt3Ni nanocrystals. Real-time microscopic observations at ambient pressure show the formation of oxygen-driven Ni oxide clusters on the surface and provide direct evidence of Pt-NiO1-x interfacial structure formation. Spectroscopic analysis, including ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy, and catalytic measurements elucidate the role of Pt-NiO1-x interfacial structures and the catalytic reaction mechanism in CO oxidation. Our results indicate that metal-oxide interfacial intermediate structures in bimetal catalysts relate to the catalytic enhancement of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200015

Herein, a simple and ingenious strategy is developed for the fabrication of SACs via atomic filtration during a solid diffusion process under the assistance of graphene oxide membranes (GOMs). First, driven by the heat treatment, the Fe species (atoms, cluster, or particles) are emitted from Fe foam diffused through the GOMs. By elaborately modulating the layer numbers of the GOM and their interlayer spacing, the GOM could exclude the cluster and particles of the Fe species. Thus, the permeable single Fe atoms were trapped by defective N-rich sites, producing isolated Fe site catalyst (Fe SAs/N-C). The fabricated SACs exhibited an excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Furthermore, this strategy can be easily expanded to prepare other SACs, such as Co SAs/N-C and Ni SAs/N-C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200016

The PEC potential of the electrocatalyst depends on the chemical oxidation state of forming elements, which may strongly vary under the photoinduced charge flow. However, element-sensitive, real-time measurements of the oxidation state of the electrocatalyst are not generally possible using conventional X-ray absorption techniques. Here, we show that fixed-energy X-ray absorption voltammetry and chronoamperometry, which measure the X-ray absorption coefficient variations along with photocurrent, can follow in real time the redox kinetics of electrocatalysts. To demonstrate the validity, we investigate hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoanodes covered with a nickel hydroxide electrocatalyst and show that it is fully oxidized by photogenerated holes to nickel oxyhydroxide with Ni reaching a higher oxidation state (Ni-IV) than that observed under electrocatalytic oxygen evolution in dark conditions. Highly oxidized Ni results from charge accumulation in the overlayer and can be observed only in the case of thick layers (with low PEC performance). On the other hand, the average oxidation state of Ni reaches lower values, under operative conditions, for very thin layers, resulting in high PEC activity. We complete our study by presenting PEC activity and impedance spectroscopy analysis using different thicknesses of the electrocatalyst, thus giving a detailed picture of the multiple and complex charge transfer processes occurring at a semiconductor/electrocatalyst junction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200017

Their low overpotentials and improved selectivity toward C-2 products make them unique. However, the structure of the active sites responsible for these improvements remains unclear. Herein, by means of a computational model including thermodynamic, kinetic, solvent, and cation effects, we outline the atomic structure of the active sites responsible for ethanol evolution in OD-Cu catalysts. We also point out the specific features that determine selectivity and pinpoint the design criteria that should be fulfilled to enhance the selectivity of the catalysts toward ethanol. Specifically, we propose that square, four-atom Cu islands are the active sites of OD-Cu for CO electroreduction to ethanol as they display favorable *CO dimerization energetics and ethanol selectivity by virtue of their square, undercoordinated structure.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200018

The ligand was discovered through a library screening approach and highlights the value of mining heteroatom-rich pharmaceutical libraries for useful ligand motifs. Further evaluation revealed that this ligand is uniquely effective in these challenging transformations.

The enzyme's potential is however limited, due to its poor regio and stereoselectivity with enantioselectivities (E-values) below 20 for bulky (aromatic) substrates. By applying computer-guided rational design, a library of single variants was designed that allowed conversion of a set of previously challenging substrates with good activity and E-values up to >200. The computational predictions were found to be in agreement with experimental data, which in turn allowed for the generation of even more active and selective double variants. Overall, the produced set of variants provides a toolbox for the enantioselective acylation of challenging alcohols in water, effectively contributing to an alternative to reactions in organic solvents.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200020

Whereas various Pd-catalyzed migratory cross-couplings have been developed in the past years, the design of an efficient migratory version of the popular Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling has remained elusive. The current article reports a one-pot procedure consisting of alkene hydroboration and migratory Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of the resulting alkylboronic acid intermediate. A high regioselectivity for the benzylic position of the initial alkene was achieved by using P(t-Bu)(2)Me as the ligand and an ortho-substituted aryl electrophile. Regioconvergence from alkene positional and geometrical isomers and long-range migration were demonstrated. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the migration occurs through a partially reversible, nondissociative mechanism.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200021

The trans-selective arylsilylation/remote C-H silylation and hydroarylation/remote C-H borylation of internal alkynes were also achieved using hexamethyldisilane and bis(pinacolato)diboron as trapping reagents, respectively.

A major challenge is their insufficient performance and durability in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) under practical hydrogen-air conditions. Herein, we report an effective strategy to synthesize atomically dispersed Mn-N-C catalysts from an environmentally benign aqueous solution, instead of traditional organic solvents. This innovative synthesis method yields an extremely high surface area for accommodating an increased density of MnN4 active sites, which was verified by using advanced electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Mn-N-C catalyst exhibits promising ORR activity along with significantly enhanced stability, achieving a peak power density of 0.39 W cm(-2) under 1.0 bar H-2-air condition in a MEA, outperforming most PGM-free ORR catalysts. The improved performance is likely due to the unique catalyst features, including the curved surface morphology and dominant graphitic carbon structure, thus benefiting mass transport and improving stability. The first-principles calculations further elucidate the enhanced stability, suggesting that MnN4 sites have a higher resistance to demetallation than the traditional FeN4 sites during the ORR.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200023

Crystalline orthorhombic Mo3VOx (Orth-MoVO), trigonal Mo3VOx (Tri-MoVO), and amorphous Mo3VOx (Amor-MoVO) having pentagonal, hexagonal, and heptagonal channels in the crystal structure showed far better catalytic activity and selectivity to methacrylic acid (MAA) than those of various Mo-V-based mixed oxide catalysts. Tetragonal Mo3VOx (Tet-MoVO) having pentagonal and hexagonal but no heptagonal channels in the crystal structure provided minor MCR oxidation activity, and the MAA selectivity was lower than that of the other crystalline Mo3VOx catalysts with heptagonal channels. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements revealed that Orth-MoVO and Tri-MoVO were active with respect to MCR, forming methacrylate as a reaction intermediate, while no infrared (IR) bands related to surface compounds were observed over Tet-MoVO after the MCR injection. Based on these results, we concluded that the crystal structure of crystalline Mo3VOx catalysts significantly affects the catalytic MCR oxidation activity. Orth-MoVO catalyzed the MCR oxidation at low reaction temperatures (<240 degrees C), where the conventional catalyst used for the industrial MCR oxidation process, a heteropoly acid (HPA)-based catalyst, displayed poor catalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200024

We provide a persuasive strategy to turn manganese oxide from a combustion catalyst into a selective catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This success is achieved by anchoring amorphous manganese oxide with thin-layer morphology on a ceria support via constructing strong oxide-support interactions (SOSIs). Multiple structure and mechanism investigations demonstrate that the SOSI forms active interfacial oxygen sites for propane activation and oxygen-deficient manganese oxide to stabilize propene and hinder overoxidation under the ODHP conditions.

However, it generally suffers from laborious multistep procedures to obtain a controllable film. Herein, we use an electron density modulation to synthesize a stable NiFeY layered double hydroxide (LDH) OEC and then deposit this OEC on BiVO4 as photoanodes. The incorporation of Y modifies the chemical environment of Ni and reduces the bandgap of NiFe LDH, enhancing the electrocatalytic/photoelectrochemical performance. Importantly, Y insertion in NiFe LDH remarkably reduces the surface recombination of the BiVO4/cocatalyst system, thereby establishing a much high stability to the photocatalyst than in conventional NiFe OEC/BiVO4 approaches.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200028

Inspired by the Fe-Mo-S cofactor in the enzyme nitrogenase, metal sulfide catalysts, mostly Fe- or Mo-based sulfides, have recently received great interest. Here, we propose Cu2-xS (0 <= x < 1) as an efficient NRR electrocatalyst. Electrochemical tests at room temperature and atmospheric pressure reveal that Cu1.81S achieves a high NH3 yield of 2.19 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) along with a Faradaic efficiency of 14.1% at -0.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in an aqueous electrolyte. According to our first-principles calculations, the superior NRR properties originate from the threefold-coordinate Cu sites in Cu1.81S. These sites enable N-H center dot center dot center dot S hydrogen bonding during N2Hy adsorption and stabilize the intermediates on the Cu2-xS surfaces, leading to a significant decrease in the overpotential limit for the NRR. Moreover, the threefold sites not only provide a bioinspired NRR pathway similar to that of nitrogenase but also enable both distal and alternating pathways, increasing the efficiency for the NRR. This study presents an attractive electrocatalyst for the NRR and opens an alternative route to explore chalcogenides and halides as NRR catalysts where the hydrogen-bonding mediation can similarly operate.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200029

Of particular interest is the production of middle distillate fuels (i.e., jet and diesel blendstock) from renewable ethanol feedstock. State-of-the-art alcohol-to-jet technology requires multiple process steps based on the catalytic dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, followed by a multistep oligomerization including n-butene formation and then hydrotreatment and distillation. Here we report that, over Ag-ZrO2/SBA-16 with balanced metal and Lewis acid sites, ethanol is directly converted to n-butene (1- and 2-butene mixtures) with an exceptional butene-rich olefin selectivity of 88% at 99% conversion. The need for the ethanol dehydration to ethylene step is eliminated. Thus, it offers the potential for a reduction in the number of required processing units versus conventional alcohol-to-jet technology. We also found that the C-4 product distribution, n-butene and/or 1,3-butadiene, can be tailored on this catalyst by tuning the hydrogen feed partial pressure and other process/catalyst parameters. With sufficient hydrogen partial pressure, 1,3-butadiene is completely and selectively hydrogenated to form n-butene. The reaction mechanism was elucidated through operando-nuclear magnetic resonance investigations coupled with reactivity measurements. Ethanol is first dehydrogenated to acetaldehyde over the metallic Ag, then acetaldehyde is converted to crotonaldehyde over the acid sites of ZrO2/SiO2 via aldol condensation followed by dehydration. This is followed by a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of crotonaldehyde to butadiene intermediate that is hydrogenated into n-butene over metallic Ag and ZrO2. A minor fraction of n-butene is also produced from crotonaldehyde reduction to butyraldehyde instead of butadiene. Isotopically labeled ethanol NMR experiments demonstrated that ethanol, rather than H-2, is the source of H for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to butyraldehyde. Combined experimental-computational investigation reveals how changes in silver and zirconium composition and the silver oxidation state affects reactivity under controlled hydrogen partial pressures and after prolonged run times. Finally, catalyst effectiveness also was demonstrated when using wet ethanol feed, thus highlighting process flexibility in terms of feedstock purity requirements.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200032

Amidomethylative reactions that reserve C=C double bonds have been composed sequentially for tandem catalytic substitutions around the C=C bonds of alkenes. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, tandem catalytic amidomethylative processes, which effectively form multiple C-C bonds, have been developed to directly and selectively transform a-substituted styrenes into unsaturated N-heterocycles. Using Fe(OTf)(3) as the sole catalyst, the operationally simple protocols employ bench-stable bisamidomethane as the sole reagent to produce hexahydropyrimidines and 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine derivatives. Moreover, the practical catalytic processes constituted facile two-step pathways, from simple alpha-substituted styrenes, to access unsaturated 1,3-diamine and bispidine derivatives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200034

However, the insufficient durability issue of PtM is often raised because of the fast dissolution of M in acid, impeding their commercialization. Herein, we report on a Ketjenblack (KB)-supported, nitrogen (N)-doped intermetallic PtNiN (Int-PtNiN/KB) catalyst that exhibits remarkably enhanced ORR activity and stability in an acidic electrolyte, superior to those of disordered PtNi/KB, disordered PtNiN/KB, and commercial Pt/C. The experimental results show that Int-PtNiN/KB has a distinctive ordering structure of alternating Ni-4-N and Pt planes; we attribute the origin of the superior stability of this catalyst to the combined effect of the Ni-4-N formation and the unique intermetallic structure, which effectively precludes Ni dissolution from the core. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the tensile strain introduced by the formation of an intermetallic phase and N-doping optimizes the binding of oxygenated species on the Pt surface and enable highly efficient electron transfer, leading to the enhanced ORR performance. This study offers an appropriate route for further enhancing both the activity and durability of PtM catalysts through a facile synthesis method by annealing in an NH3 gas under appropriate conditions.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200035

Herein, direct cellulose hydrogenolysis to C-3-C-4 keto-alcohol products (hydroxyacetone and 1(3)hydroxy-2-butanone) was achieved over Ni-WOx/C catalysts with an W/Ni atom ratio of 1.0-5.0. The keto-alcohol yield was proposed to strongly depend on the W/Ni ratio and the catalyst annealing temperature. The highest keto-alcohol yield of 63% was obtained at the optimal balance of basic/acidic WOx species and metallic Ni. The introduction of Ni facilitated the formation of the basic W5+ sites, which enhanced the formation of basic sites at the Ni-WOx interface. The synergistic effect between the basic W5+ and acidic oxygen vacancy (Vo) could activate the target C-O/C=O bonds, promoting the isomerization of glucose and C-3-C-4 aldehyde intermediates with the assistance of the interfacial Ni. The cooperative adsorption of the -OH and -C=O groups at the Ni-O-W-Vo interface stabilized the adjacent ketone and hydroxyl groups and kept the other hydroxyl groups for hydrogenolysis, obtaining the final C-3-C-4 keto-alcohols. This work expanded the application of cellulosic biomass, enabling the green and sustainable synthesis of the high-value C-3-C-4 keto-alcohol products using lignocellulosic biomass as a raw material.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200036

In this work, the surface hydroxyl groups and surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs) on alumina were modified by a convenient and environmentally friendly plasma treatment method. Different Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via impregnation of the treated alumina, and the effects of different surface hydroxyl groups and SOVs on their reactivity for the reversible hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of DBT were investigated. The results show that SOVs increased after H-2 plasma treatment, whereas the surface hydroxyl groups increased and SOVs decreased after O-2 plasma treatment. Both the surface hydroxyl group and SOV can improve Pt metal dispersion. The more interesting observation is that the hydroxyl groups promote hydrogen spillover and the proportion of Pt(0), which not only benefit the catalyst hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activity but also reduce side reactions and increase long-term cycle performance. However, increased SOVs increased the fraction of low coordinated Pt which reduces the long-term cycle performance of the catalyst. As a result, increasing surface hydroxyl groups and appropriately reducing SOVs on Pt/Al2O3 are propitious for improving both reactivity and long-term cycle performance when using DBT as a LOHC.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200037

Recent Developments in Enantioselective Transition Metal Catalysis Featuring Attractive Noncovalent Interactions between Ligand and Substrate								ACS CATALYSIS				10	18			10672	10714		10.1021/acscatal.0c02957				SEP 18 2020	2020	Enantioselective transition metal catalysis is an area very much at the forefront of contemporary synthetic research. The development of processes that enable the efficient synthesis of enantiopure compounds is of unquestionable importance to chemists working within the many diverse fields of the central science. Traditional approaches to solving this challenge have typically relied on leveraging repulsive steric interactions between chiral ligands and substrates in order to raise the energy of one of the diastereomeric transition states over the other. By contrast, this Review examines an alternative tactic in which a set of attractive noncovalent interactions operating between transition metal ligands and substrates are used to control enantioselectivity. Examples where this creative approach has been successfully applied to render fundamental synthetic processes enantioselective are presented and discussed. In many of the cases examined, the ligand scaffold has been carefully designed to accommodate these attractive interactions, while in others, the importance of the critical interactions was only elucidated in subsequent computational and mechanistic studies. Through an exploration and discussion of recent reports encompassing a wide range of reaction classes, we hope to inspire synthetic chemists to continue to develop asymmetric transformations based on this powerful concept.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200038	32983588

We found that the use of promoters alters the balance between iron oxides and iron carbides in the catalyst, which affects the CO and CO2 conversion. The Na- and K-promoted catalysts facilitated the production of C-2-C-32 olefins, and a parametric study with 12 feedstock compositions (CO/CO2 = 0.2-5 and H-2/(CO + CO2) = 1-3) revealed that the Na/Fe-Zn catalyst exhibited a 6.1-times higher apparent CO consumption rate and 2.7-times higher apparent CO2 consumption rate than the K/Fe-Zn catalyst at 340 degrees C and 2.0 MPa. At a CO/CO2 ratio of 0.2 and H-2/(CO + CO2) ratio of 2, the Na/Fe-Zn catalyst achieved the maximum linear alpha-olefin yield (17.9%) at 70.3% apparent CO conversion and 26.0% apparent CO2 conversion (58.4% higher than those of the K/Fe-Zn catalyst) over 200 h. The Na/Fe-Zn catalyst activity for apparent CO conversion was more than twice that of the K/Fe-Zn catalyst, and it also exhibited better reactivity in terms of chain growth probability and secondary reactions, such as isomerization and hydrogenation. Characterization experiments revealed that the spent Na/Fe-Zn catalyst contained 43.2% iron carbides (mainly Fe5C2), and these were distributed within 19 nm of the catalyst particle surface. In contrast, the spent K/Fe-Zn catalyst was mostly composed of core-shell-type iron carbides (74.3% Fe5C2 and 21.2% Fe7C3) surrounded by carbonate/carbonyl carbon species. H2O isotherms of the spent catalysts were studied to understand factors affecting CO adsorption and CO2 reactivity, and theoretical calculations were used to probe CO hydrogenation productivity. The reactivity of Na/Fe-Zn toward CO and CO2 was analyzed with respect to the temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocities, and optimal olefin productivity.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200043

Their beneficial effects can manifest in different ways, such as increasing rates of polymerization, altering polymer microstructures, enhancing catalyst thermal stability, or a combination of these effects. We have systematically quantified secondary metal ion influences on nickel phenoxyphosphine polyethylene glycol (PEG) complexes. We demonstrate that cation tuning could readily achieve three-dimensional structures and electronic environments that are not easily accessible through conventional ligand tuning. This study led to the development of extremely active ethylene polymerization catalysts. For example, the nickel-lithium complex gave activity and turnover number as high as 7.0 x 10(4) kg PE/mol Ni.h and 2.5 x 10(6) mol ethylene/mol Ni, respectively, and the nickel-cesium complex showed unusual thermal stability up to 90 degrees C (activity = 2.3 x 10(4) kg/mol h, turnover number = similar to 4.1 x 10(5) mol ethylene/mol Ni, and M-n = 1.6 x 10(4) g/mol). We provide both experimental and computational data showing that secondary metals impact the relative stability of cis and trans isomers, which is a phenomenon not shown previously. Unlike in our earlier work, which was limited by poor nuclearity control and/or secondary metals that were too far from the catalyst center, the nickel phenoxyphosphine-PEG complex is an ideal platform for future studies of cation-controlled polymerization.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200044

Due to growing concerns regarding the validity of Pt counter electrodes in such measurements, largely attributed to their dissolution and redeposition, graphite is increasingly being employed as a versatile counter electrode in conventional three-electrode systems. However, the reliability of graphite in this role has not been fully investigated. Herein, we have demonstrated that using graphite as a counter electrode can significantly hinder the precise evaluations of electrocatalytic materials. For a polycrystalline Pt surface coupled with a graphite counter electrode, the rapid loss of catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) is observed within a few voltammetric evaluation cycles. Online differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) revealed that the catalytic activity loss is mainly due to the formation of poisonous carbon monoxide (CO) and its subsequent strong adsorption on the catalytic Pt sites. CO coverage on the Pt surface becomes almost saturated within just 50 cycles of HER polarization measurements. The resultant underestimation of activity is effectively avoidable by physically separating the graphite counter electrode from the analyte in an H-type cell. Consequently, our findings highlight that, similar to Pt counter electrodes, graphite counter electrodes must be carefully applied to eliminate any experimental artifacts originating from CO evolved during electrocatalytic reactions.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200045

The reaction proceeds via an aminocatalytic double Michael addition in high formal peri-, diastereo-, and enatioselectivity (up to 99% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations conclude that the reaction takes advantage of the in situ generation of a highly reactive amino isobenzofulvene intermediate via an aromative aminocatalytic strategy. A significant nonlinear effect is observed, consistent with a dual-activation model. Kinetic studies suggest a stepwise mechanism which is further supported by the identification and isolation of diastereomeric precyclization intermediates. These intermediates showed that in the presence of the aminocatalyst, they re-enter the catalytic cycle and afford the [10 + 2] cycloadduct with the same stereoselectivity observed in the prototypical reaction. Density functional theory calculations identified a Curtin-Hammett scenario where the stereoisomer of the [10 + 2] cycloadduct is determined by downstream species. These mechanistic investigations provide an understanding of the reaction pathway and stereoselectivity and continue to increase the knowledge of higher-order cycloadditions.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200046

A general protocol for the hydroarylation of electronically diverse alkenes with anilines would be ideal to provide densely functionalized compounds. However, this transformation has been underexplored compared to more traditional hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes because of the significant challenges associated with the control of the selectivity and its substrate tolerance. Herein, we describe a selective, versatile, and user-friendly ortho-C-alkylation of anilines with alkenes that hinges on the beneficial combination of a Lewis acid (Ca(II)) and hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent. This protocol allows for the extension of this transformation to highly deactivated styrenes and demonstrates a remarkable improved reactivity regarding aliphatic alkenes, styrene derivatives, and dienes. In addition, DFT computations were performed which, combined with experimental observations, suggest a nearly concerted mechanism that impart the ortho-selectivity.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200047

ProRSs are modular enzymes and the "prokaryotic-like" ProRSs are distinguished from "eukaryotic-like" ProRSs by the presence of an editing insertion domain (INS) inserted between motifs 2 and 3 of the main catalytic domain. Earlier studies suggested that the presence of coupled-domain dynamics could contribute to catalysis; however, the role that the distal and highly mobile INS domain plays in catalysis at the synthetic active site is not completely understood. In the present study, a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches has been used to elucidate the precise role of INS domain dynamics. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations were carried out to model catalytic prolyl-adenylate formation by Enterococcus faecalis ProRS. The energetics of the adenylate formation by the wild-type enzyme was computed and contrasted with variants containing active site mutations as well as a deletion mutant lacking the INS domain. The combined results revealed that two distinct types of dynamics contribute to the enzyme's catalytic power. One set of motions is intrinsic to the INS domain and leads to conformational preorganization that is essential for catalysis. A second type of motion, stemming from the electrostatic reorganization of active site residues, impacts the height and width of the energy profile and has a critical role in fine-tuning the substrate orientation to facilitate reactive collisions. Thus, motions in a distal domain can preorganize the active site of an enzyme to optimize catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700050	34295570

ACS uses a complex Ni-Fe-S metallocluster termed the A-cluster to assemble acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide, a methyl moiety and coenzyme A. Here, we report the crystal structure of CODH/ACS from Moorella thermoacetica with substrate carbon monoxide bound at the A-cluster, a state previously uncharacterized by crystallography. Direct structural characterization of this state highlights the role of second sphere residues and conformational dynamics in acetyl-CoA assembly, the biological equivalent of the Monsanto process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700009	33495716

We describe visible light-promoted [2 + 2] cycloaddition with concomitant dearomatization of indole derivatives tethered with olefins at the N1 position via the energy transfer process, providing cyclobutane-fused polycyclic indoline derivatives that are potentially useful in drug design and discovery. These cyclobutane-fused indoline-based polycycles are obtained in high yields and with good diastereoselectivities (>99:1). The key to the success of the reaction is the formation of H-bond(s) between N-alkenoylindole and solvent, enabling the reduction of the triplet energy of the indole derivatives, which greatly improved the efficiency of the protocol. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by late-stage skeletal diversification of indole-containing bioactive molecules, which provides a powerful strategy for the rapid skeleton remodeling. DFT calculations were used to give a deep understanding of the reaction pathways.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700043

To achieve a high photosynthesis efficiency, green plants compartmentalize water oxidation and NADPH regeneration modules on two sides of the thylakoid membrane while conveying electron transfer and proton transport via the channeling of the electron transfer chain and ATP synthase, respectively. Herein, we demonstrate this principle in vitro by using UiO-66 to confine platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) inside and immobilize L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) outside for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of a-keto acid. The framework structure of UiO-66 affords the compartmentalization of LAAO and Pt NPs to avoid the deactivation of LAAO by Pt NPs, while its angstrom-scale pore size ensures channeling of the byproduct, H2O2, from LAAO to Pt NPs for instant elimination. A 99.7% yield of alpha-keto acid is achieved, far surpassing that enabled by free LAAO (41.2%). The compartmentalization-channeling strategy offers a generic platform to coordinate reactions and mass transfer in complex catalytic processes beyond chemoenzymatic catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700001

We recently introduced a Cr N-phosphinoamidine catalyst ((P,N)Cr) transition-state model for selectivity, and here, we use density functional theory calculations to address catalyst reactivity for ethylene trimerization. This is particularly important because there are currently no empirical parameters or design principles that provide prediction of high catalyst activity while maintaining trimerization selectivity. Specifically, using transition states and the energetic span model, we examined the ethylene trimerization catalytic cycle with the bidentate (P,N)Cr catalyst 1a and compared this highly productive catalyst to the surprisingly inactive tridentate (P,N,N)Cr catalyst. For (P,N)Cr 1a, this analysis revealed that for the high-spin Cr-I/III chromacycle mechanism, there are multiple Cr-I ethylene-coordinated resting states and multiple turnover-controlling transition states, which is consistent with previous experimental rate studies and can account for a partial rate order in ethylene. Based on the calculated energy landscape, the calculated 1-hexene productivity of 6.5 mol s(-1) and mass of 2.0 x 10(6) g h(-1) is close to the experimental value. This analysis also revealed that the tridentate (P,N,N)Cr catalyst has a much larger energy span and is similar to 10(7) slower, which results from the stabilization of the energy landscape around the chromacyclopentane intermediate. In addition to this reactivity/inactivity comparison, we also calculated and compared the reactivity of several other experimentally reported 1-hexene Cr tridentate catalysts. Based on the catalytic energy spans, our calculations were able to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively replicate relative catalyst reactivity.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700002

With the use of an ultrathin and flat 12 mu m thick porous electrode complimented by an efficient gas-circulating loop, the GAME facilitates rapid mass transport of reactants and products at the three-phase interface, enabling electrocatalytic processes to be investigated with fine kinetic details at high current densities (A cm(-2)) using only mu g cm(-2) of catalyst. The mass transport rate constant of the GAME is generally 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those achieved using conventional techniques. The gas handling protocol ensures better utilization and fast switching of different gaseous environments within a few seconds, thereby reducing the use of gases and allowing for measurement of transient responses. This electrochemical configuration can be further coupled with a range of other analytical approaches, such as micro-/nanoelectrodes, mass spectrometry, photocatalysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for real-time/in situ electrochemical measurements, where reaction intermediates and products can be readily characterized. These innovative types of hyphenated platforms can be applied to study complex gas-to-fuel conversion processes (e.g., carbon dioxide electroreduction), in which multiple species need to be simultaneously identified and quantified to illustrate the dynamic product distribution. Moreover, the configuration can be possibly adapted for operando synchrotron-based X-ray characterization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700003

It, however, fails in selective acetylene hydrogenation: at high H-2 pressures and 100% conversion, the dominant product is ethane, not the desirable ethene. Despite decades' efforts, even the structure of the catalyst remains to be veiled by the in situ formation of unknown PdHx and, controversially, PdCx phases. Here, by combining our recently developed machine learning potential global optimization, microkinetic simulation, and catalysis experiment, we resolve a Pd4H3 phase formed under hydrogenation reaction conditions (e.g., 298 K and p(H-2) > 0.1 atm), in which the exposed Pd4H3(100) open surface is the most responsible for catalyzing the deep hydrogenation to ethane at high H-2 pressures. This finding is rooted in the thermodynamics phase diagram for the Pd-H bulk and surfaces from millions of structure candidates explored by stochastic surface walking (SSW) global optimization and the lowest-energy pathways for the hydrogenation on different surfaces. Guided by the theoretical prediction, Pd catalysts with a large particle size (26 nm) dominated by the close-packed (111) surface are synthesized and tested for selective acetylene hydrogenation in comparison with that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (particle size similar to 2 nm). We show that simple nanostructure engineering improves markedly the selectivity by 16 times, from 4.5% for the commercial Pd catalyst to 76% for our designed Pd catalysts at 100% acetylene conversion and 293 K, showing great promise for machine learning-guided catalyst design. General guidelines to further improve catalyst selectivity are proposed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700004

As two main intermediates in HCHO transformation, the conversion of dioxymethylene (DOM) to formate is one of the key steps. There are three recognized pathways for this step, including direct dissociation of DOM, DOM combining with surface O, or through a Cannizzaro-type reaction. Herein, we reveal that the catalytic reaction between DOM and the abundant surface OH groups is a facile pathway for the transformation of DOM to formate species on TiO2 and also on TiO2-supported noble metal catalysts. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results demonstrate that the presence of water vapor is favorable for the conversion of DOM to formate species on TiO2, and the loading of noble metals (Ir/Pt) on TiO2 further promotes the activation of H2O, thereby boosting the transformation of DOM into formate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that HCHO consumes the bridging OH groups to form DOM species first followed by the reaction between DOM and the terminal OH groups on the TiO2 surface to produce formate, and the latter reaction is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. These results provide deeper insight into HCHO transformation and demonstrate another role of surface hydroxyl groups in catalytic reaction.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700005

This method allows for simultaneous monitoring of reactants and products in the gas phase and species adsorbed on the surface during the reaction. The results were compared with the hydrogenation of propyne using Pd-free Cu(111) as well as with previous studies on Pd/Cu SAA catalysts supported on alumina. Propene production occurs at temperatures of 383 K and above as indicated by the appearance of an infrared peak at 912 cm(-1), which is a unique characteristic feature of gas phase propene. Propyne was found to adsorb on the surface at 300 K in the presence of gas phase propyne to form a di-s/di-p structure, as the spectrum was identical to that reported in the literature for propyne adsorbed on Cu(111) at 150 K in ultrahigh vacuum. The presence of a carbonaceous layer on the surface is indicated by a dramatic increase in the intensity of a peak at 2968 cm(-1) at temperatures above 400 K. The progression of gas phase peaks at 912 and 3322 cm-1 was used to calculate the rate of production of propene and the rate of consumption of propyne, respectively. This reaction rate was used to determine a turnover frequency of 25.4 s(-1) at 383 K for the reaction on the Pd/Cu(111) SAA surface. The reaction was not impeded by the presence of the carbonaceous layer, even for a layer so thick that only carbon was detectable on the surface with Auger electron spectroscopy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700006

High-valent transition-metal sites have been considered as OER active sites; however, the rational design and construction of these sites remain a big challenge. Here, we report a trimetallic NiFeCu oxyhydroxide electrocatalyst, in which high-valent Ni sites are promoted and stabilized by the atomically embedded Cu, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Through compositional optimization, Ni6Fe1Cu1 catalysts achieved an overpotential of 385 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 164 mV dec(-1), and a stability of 100 h at pH = 7.2. Density function theory calculations demonstrated that the Cu-doping facilitates the formation of high-valent Ni and thus promotes OER electrocatalysis through modulating the d-band center of Ni and reducing the adsorption energy of oxygenated intermediates on the surface of the catalyst. This work paves a promising avenue for the construction of desired high-valent metal OER catalysts by embedding redox inactive metals.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700007

By the introduction of two nitro (NO2) groups to the AQ moieties, an approximate 45-fold increase in the discharge capacity has been realized with a high discharge potential.

All the polymers show better performance than TiO2, and the hybrid materials (only 10 wt % of polymer loading) show a higher hydrogen evolution rate than the sum of their components. The best value is recorded for the IEP-7@T-10 sample which shows 12-fold higher HER than the sum of its individual bare materials. Also, this sample with 1 wt % photodeposited platinum as cocatalyst shows a photonic efficiency (xi, %) of 14.54, 4.4-fold higher than the photonic efficiency of Pt/TiO2, in the same conditions. The combination of time-resolved fluorescence with transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements with the use of electron and hole scavengers allows us to determine an effective charge transfer mechanism Type II as mainly responsible for the improved photocatalytic activity.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700013

Traditional synthetic methods for Pt alloy catalysts involve impregnation of two metal salts onto high surface area supports followed by thermal reduction to form an alloy, which frequently results in inhomogeneous alloying and phase segregation of excess metal oxides in the material. In this work, we utilize colloidal methods to synthesize supported Pt-In and Pt-Ga nanoparticles with controlled bimetallic composition. The supported colloidal nanoparticles display phase uniformity while eliminating large excesses of In and Ga oxides, which allows us to ascertain the role that the bimetallic phase and composition play in tuning the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst in both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Indeed, the promoter-rich PtIn2 phase shows the highest turnover rate for ethane dehydrogenation, which we attribute to both the strong electronic perturbation to Pt sites observed in Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and the major geometric change at the surface upon formation of the CaF2 crystal structure adopted by PtIn2. Finally, we show that the promoter-rich colloidal nanoparticles are more thermally robust than incipient wetness impregnation catalysts of the same composition because they eliminate two deactivation pathways-reduction and vaporization of unalloyed promoter atoms-that only occur on the structurally nonuniform impregnated catalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700014

Experimental mechanistic investigations on a representative ligand system established that the reaction rate is zeroth order in the concentration of the borylating agent HBpin, first order in [alkyne] and in [Ir], and inverse first order in [H-2]. These findings are understood as arising from the formation of the saturated, 18-electron resting state (PNP)IrH(3)Bpin (5a), which is required to dissociate H-2 in order to enter the C-H oxidative addition reaction with the alkyne. However, the overall highest transition state corresponds to the B-H rotation following C-H oxidative addition. This realization follows from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and is consistent with the modest experimentally determined kinetic isotope effect of 1.5(1) for C-H/C-D. DFT-calculated Delta G(298)double dagger = 17.6 kcal/mol and Delta H = 13.9 kcal/mol match the experimentally determined values (Delta G(298)double dagger = 20(2) kcal/mol and Delta H double dagger = 16(2) kcal/mol) reasonably well. DFT calculations were used to demonstrate that the boryl migration from the amido N to Ir is too high in energy to play a part in the DHBTA mechanism in the (PNP)Ir system. This is in surprising contrast to the seemingly closely related (SiNN)Ir system studied previously. DFT calculations further provide insights into the greater kinetic barrier for activating a C-H bond of a terminal alkyne trans to a boryl ligand versus trans to a hydride, explaining why diboryl Ir compounds are not catalytically competent in this system.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700015

Above 300 degrees C, the carbon-depositing Boudouard reaction competes with the FTS reaction for CO as reactant. By making use of a combined in situ X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD)/Raman spectroscopy setup, the simultaneous evolution of the FexOy/alpha-Fe/FexC phases and various formed carbon species has been monitored at 340 degrees C and 10 bar. CO carburized, Na-S promoted and unpromoted Fe(-Na-S)/alpha-Al2O3 catalysts were investigated. The various Fe phases present were quantified with Rietveld quantitative phase analysis (R-QPA) from the in situ collected XRPD patterns. The observed D- and G-bands in the in situ Raman spectra were analyzed for their relative intensities, band widths, and positions and compared to reference carbon materials. It was found that amorphous carbon with C sp(3) and C sp(2) in chain-like ordering evolved toward carbon nanofiber-like structures during FTS. Na-S promotion and initial CO carburization at temperatures >= 340 degrees C led to an increased amount of cyclic sixfold C sp(2) species. Preliminary carbon deposits present in the catalysts decreased the initial fast increase of the Raman band intensities, while Na-S promotion increased Raman band intensity growth after the initial fast increase period. The carbon species evolution was unaffected by the presence of specific Fe carbides or by carbide-to-carbide transitions. Na-S promotion aided in the reduction of Fe3O4 by (H-2:)CO to carbon-depositing Fe carbides. The results obtained add to our further understanding on the role of Fe and carbon species during a high-temperature FTS reaction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700016

Metal-catalyzed cross-coupling and nucleophilic aromatic substitution are among the most reliable methods to access functionalized arenes. In these reactions, haloarenes are often used as a versatile synthetic platform to introduce various functional groups. However, haloarenes are typically prepared from the corresponding nitroarenes through the classic sequence of reduction, diazotization, and halogenation. Thus, haloarene cross-coupling can become a multistep transformation overall. To avoid this lengthy sequence, the direct utilization of nitroarenes has the potential to significantly streamline synthetic processes and, therefore, has attracted attention in the chemistry community from the vantage points of atom- and step-economy. In this Review, we comprehensively cover advances in transition-metal-catalyzed denitrative reactions of nitroarenes.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700017

Using Pd/NHC complex as a precatalyst, regioselective addition of thiols to cyclopropyl acetylenes was successfully performed, leading to densely functionalized compounds in excellent selectivity (up to 99:1) and high yields (up to 99%). Formation of Markovnikov-type products by insertion of alkyne into the Pd-S bond was confirmed experimentally. Molecular dynamics of the alkyne insertion into the Pd-S bond was performed computationally to identify key factors controlling the remarkable regioselectivity of this process. The fundamental question of how a small difference in activation energies can result in very high regioselectivity has been addressed by experimental methods combined with computational modeling. We show that the insertion of alkyne into the Pd-S bond proceeds by an asynchronous mechanism, which starts with metal-carbon binding and resolves into diverse transient structures. We further demonstrate that dynamic involvement of these structures ensures regioselectivity of the entire process, thus providing a mechanistic link that has long been missing. Alkyne insertion into the metal-heteroatom bond is a fundamental elementary step and a corner stone of catalysis and organometallic chemistry that works for a large variety of metals and heteroatoms. Mastering its Markovnikov vs anti-Markovnikov selectivity provides powerful opportunities for the design of selective functionalization routes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700018

However, nitrogen doping results in distinct modifications to their visible light absorption. Na/La ordering in the structure of NaLaTiO4 brings interesting structural features that are critical to a wealth of important factors such as nitrogen uptake, defect concentration, microstructures, and so forth. In sharp contrast to nitrogen-doped Sr2TiO4 (i.e., Sr2TiO4-xNy) whose photocatalytic activity is negligible under visible light illumination, nitrogen-doped NaLaTiO4 (i.e. NaLaTiO4-xNy) demonstrates very high activities for both photocatalytic water reduction and oxidation reactions. High apparent quantum efficiency similar to 3.2% at 420 +/- 20 nm has been recorded for NaLaTiO4-xNy, outperforming many other active metal oxynitride photocatalysts investigated under similar conditions. Theoretical calculations reveal that Na/La ordering incurs a strong electric field across Ti(O, N)(6) octahedron layers and breaks the coplanar settlement of highest occupied molecular orbitals and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals which are helpful to inhibit intralayer charge recombination.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700019

This protocol is characterized by high yields under environmentally benign reaction conditions and allows the regioselective and chemoselective functionalization of activated double bonds. Besides the synthetic utility of the shown transformation, this study undergirds the exclusive role of copper in photoredox catalysis as the title transformation is not possible via the most commonly employed ruthenium, iridium, or organic dye-based photocatalysts owing to the ability of copper to stabilize and interact with radical intermediates in its coordination sphere. Furthermore, the protocol can be smoothly scaled to gram quantities of the product, which offers manifold possibilities for further transformations, for example, heterocycle synthesis or intramolecular cyclopropanation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700020

Ionic additives and electrolyte ions can serve as promoters for specific reaction pathways. The judicious addition of these charged species thus represents a rich chemical strategy for tuning the electrode-electrolyte interface to achieve high product selectivity and catalytic activity. We have previously shown that trace amounts of surfactant can efficiently suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and promote the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) toward CO and HCOO- on a polycrystalline Cu foil working electrode. The major focus of herein study is to identify the impact of a model surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), on the double-layer structure in the presence of different alkali metal cations during electrocatalytic CO2RR. We postulated that the alkali cations and the positively charged surfactant headgroup will compete for a position at the negatively biased Cu electrode, leading to potentially synergistic effects on the catalytic performance. Indeed, it was observed that the positively charged trimethylammonium surfactant molecules effectively displace the alkali cations and suppress HER. However, the CO2RR activity and selectivity are nearly independent with respect to the identity of the alkali cations (Li+, Na+, and K+) in the presence of CTAB. Cesium cations defy this trend, where high HCOO- activity is observed. A molecular model of the double layer is proposed where CTAB molecules are competing for a position at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), resulting in only a small concentration of electrolyte cation at the electrode surface in the presence of CTAB. Furthermore, we postulate that the decrease in C2H4 activity is due to interfacial hydrophobicity caused by surfactant accumulation. We expect that these fundamental understandings will lead to advanced strategies for designing efficient organic additive to modulate the double-layer structure and optimize for selective small-molecule activation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700021

It is thought that strong, direct, and permanent electric fields within the active site of the enzyme contribute to the superb catalytic efficiency of enzymes. This effect is called electrostatic preorganization. Most often, electrostatic preorganization is analyzed by evaluating the local electric field at discrete points, such as a bond center, using, for example, vibrational Stark spectroscopy. However, the protein macromolecule creates a significantly more complicated heterogeneous electric field that affects the entire active site, whose total change density thus gets perturbed, with implications for the catalytic mechanism. We present a global distribution of streamlines method to analyze the topology of the heterogeneous electric fields within an enzyme active site. We focus on ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), an enzyme known to produce a field on the order of 100 MV/cm along the critical carbonyl bond in the steroid substrate. We investigate how mutations known to cause activity changes and applied small external electric fields perturb the electric fields in the KSI active site. When classical single-point analysis failed, our method allowed us to properly correlate global changes in the electric field with changes in the reaction barrier. We were able to show that topologically similar local electric fields had similar reaction barriers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700022

Despite recent significant advances in C-H functionalization chemistry, this strategy remains unsatisfactorily developed. In this report, we disclose a simple and straightforward protocol to allow for the selective C-H functionalization of unprotected double-benzannellated N-heterocycles via gold-catalyzed carbene-transfer reactions (29 examples, up to 86% yield). The scope of the reaction can also be expanded to the corresponding protected heterocycles (37 examples, up to 98% yield), further demonstrating the generality of this method. Mechanistic studies by density functional theory (DFT) calculations underpin the importance of the gold catalyst and reveal that the selectivity of this reaction is driven by trace amounts of water present in the reaction mixture.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700023

However, the limit of static catalyst performance defined by the Sabatier principle has motivated a dynamic approach to catalyst design, whereby catalysts oscillate between varying energetic states. In this work, the concept of dynamic catalytic resonance was experimentally demonstrated via the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid over Pt. Oscillation of the electrodynamic potential between 0 and 0.8 V NHE via a square waveform at varying frequency (10(-3) < f < 103 Hz) increased the turnover frequency to similar to 20 s(-1) at 100 Hz, over one order of magnitude (20x) faster than optimal potentiostatic conditions. We attribute the accelerated dynamic catalysis to nonfaradaic formic acid dehydration to surface-bound carbon monoxide at low potentials, followed by surface oxidation and desorption to carbon dioxide at high potentials.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700024

In this work, highly fluorescent aspartic acid-based carbon dots (CDs) are synthesized and employed as a photosensitizer to drive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with an [FeFe] hydrogenase (CrHydA1). The direct interaction in CDs from L-aspartic acid (AspCDs)/CrHydA1 self-assembly systems, which is visualized from native gel electrophoresis, has been systematically investigated to understand the electron-transfer dynamics and its impact on photocatalytic efficiency. The study discloses the significant influence of the electrostatic surrounding generated by sacrificial electron donors on the intimate interplay within the oppositely charged subunits of the biohybrid assembly as well as the overall photocatalytic performance. The system reaches an external quantum efficiency of 1.7% at 420 nm and an initial activity of 1.73 mu mol(H-2) mg(-1) (hydrogenase) min(-1) under favorable electrostatic conditions. Owing to the ability of the synthesized AspCDs to operate efficiently under visible light, in contrast to other materials that require UV illumination, the stability of the biohybrid assembly in the presence of a redox mediator extends beyond 1 week.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700025

Following synthesis by galvanic displacement, the nanowires had Pt surface areas of 90 m(2) g(Pt)(-1). The nanowire specific exchange current densities were 2-3 times greater than commercial nanoparticles and may benefit from the extended nanostructure morphology that avoids fringe facets and produces higher quantities of Pt{100}. Hydrogen annealing was used to alloy Pt and Ni zones and compress the Pt lattice. Following annealing, the nanowire activity improved to 4 times greater than the as-synthesized wires and 10 times greater than Pt nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the influence of lattice compression and exposed facet on the water-splitting reaction; it was found that at a lattice of 3.77 angstrom, the (100) facet of a Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt weakens hydrogen binding and lowers the barrier to water-splitting as compared to pure Pt(100). Moreover, the activation energy of water-splitting on the (100) facet of a Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt is particularly advantageous at 0.66 eV as compared to the considerably higher 0.90 eV required on (111) surfaces of pure Pt or Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt. This favorable effect may be slightly mitigated during further optimization procedures such as acid leaching near-surface Ni, necessary to incorporate the nanowires into electrolyzer membrane electrode assemblies. Exposure to acid resulted in slight dealloying and Pt lattice expansion, which reduced half-cell activity, but exposed Pt surfaces and improved single-cell performance. Membrane electrode assembly performance was kinetically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than Ni and slightly better than Pt nanoparticles while at one tenth the Pt loading. These electrocatalysts potentially exploit the highly active {100} facets and provide an ultralow Pt group metal option that can enable anion exchange membrane electrolysis, bridging the gap to proton exchange membrane-based systems.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700026

These materials exhibited superb electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. For example, the mass activity of a Pt45Cu55 film, at 0.90 V (vs RHE), was 3.5x higher than that of commercial Pt/C (40 wt % Pt). This activity enhancement is attributed, in part, to the ligand effect of the Cu component. The introduction of Au, as a third metal constituent to the porous films, further improved the ORR performance significantly. The synergistic effect(s) of Au and Pt appear to have a critical impact on the enhancement of the ORR activity. Compositional optimization identified the dealloyed Pt37Cu56Au7 porous film as the best performing electrocatalyst. It also exhibited the highest mass and specific activities (0.871 A/mg(Pt), 1.85 mA/cm(2)) which were 7.20x and 8.15x higher than those of commercial Pt/C (40 wt % Pt), respectively.

In this work, PdBi ordered intermetallic (O-PdBi) nanoparticles were prepared in an effort to mitigate the formation of adsorbed species like COads through isolating the Pd atoms. The enhanced antipoisoning capability of O-PdBi, relative to Pd, gave rise to superior activity and stability during FAOR. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and CO stripping results indicated that COads could be removed more easily on O-PdBi compared with that on Pd. In situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy showed that the formation of COads on O-PdBi was effectively suppressed, while both the hollow and bridged COads were detected on Pd with continuous Pd sites. In addition to the higher content of Bi atoms on the Pd-Bi surface, the ordered atomic distribution has played an important role in this effect. This work demonstrates the superiority of ordered intermetallic Pd-based nanocatalysts and provides guidance for promoting stability in FAOR by precluding the formation of COads.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700028

However, the role Pse5Ac7Ac plays in host-pathogen interactions remains underexplored, particularly compared to its ubiquitous sialic acid analogue Neu5Ac. This is primarily due to a lack of access to difficult to prepare Pse5Ac7Ac glycosides. Herein, we describe the in vitro biocatalytic transfer of an activated Pse5Ac7Ac donor onto glycosyl acceptors, enabling the enzymatic synthesis of Pse5Ac7Ac-containing glycosides. In a chemoenzymatic approach, chemical synthesis initially afforded access to a late-stage Pse5Ac7Ac biosynthetic intermediate, which was subsequently converted to the desired CMP-glycosyl donor in a one-pot two-enzyme process using biosynthetic enzymes. Finally, screening a library of 13 sialyltransferases (SiaT) with the unnatural substrate enabled the identification of a promiscuous inverting SiaT capable of turnover to afford beta-Pse5Ac7Ac-terminated glycosides.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700029

However, the narrow substrate scope of wild-type TD limits its application. This issue could be overcome by engineering the substrate tunnel of the enzyme. Here, Corynebacterium glutamicum TD (CgTD) was used as a model, and its substrate tunnel was identified as a gating element. On the basis of the gating characteristics and constitution of the substrate access tunnel of CgTD, an "open-gate" strategy was developed to improve its substrate scope toward bulky substrates. The best variant obtained following this approach, CgTD(Mu7), exhibited 90.6-fold greater catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M) toward a bulky substrate such as phenylserine. The improvement was due to more efficient substrate coupling, deprotonation, and imine hydrolysis. CgTD(Mu7) was used for efficient production of both natural and unnatural a-keto acids, including 2-oxobutyric acid (83.4 g L-1, 99% conversion), phenylpyruvic acid (72.5 g L-1, 95% conversion), 2-oxovaleric acid (21.1 g L-1, 91% conversion), and 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid (29.9 g L-1, 84% conversion). The proposed strategy provides a theoretical basis for the synthesis of a-keto acids and is also effective for engineering other similar enzymes.									7	1	0	0	4	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700030

However, the synthesis of these compounds often requires selective protection/deprotection steps leading to waste and poor atom economy. Here we describe the truncation of a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) yielding an adenylation domain capable of selective amide bond formation under aqueous conditions. This truncated construct had a higher amidation activity compared to the full-length enzyme. The amidation reaction is mediated by ATP, which can be recycled from polyphosphate using a class III polyphosphate kinase (CHU). The wide substrate scope and selectivity of this enzymatic amidation method were confirmed through the synthesis of 24 pharmaceutically relevant amides including building blocks of six active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Moreover, up-scaling of selected examples, including two API's, was achieved demonstrating the value of this approach for synthesis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700031

However, its mechanism is not fully understood owing to the contrasting behaviors exhibited by several Fe catalysts. Indeed, whereas a few Fe catalysts exhibit an activity dominated by inductive effects, the activity of others reveal significant and even dominant radical delocalization. Therefore, no clear and general rationale of aziridination has yet emerged. Elaborating on our previous studies, we anticipated that replacing two pyridines of a pentanitrogen ligand by two quinolines would enhance the electron affinity of the corresponding imido FeIV active species and hence its aziridination activity. This proved to be the case, and Hammett correlations indicate an electrophilic active species and dominant inductive effects. The calculated reaction profile points to a two-step mechanism with the formation of the first C-N bond being rate-determining and involving a strong charge transfer in the transition state. The aziridine ring closure in the second step is almost barrierless. A clear correlation of aziridination yields with calculated EA for Fe-catalysts indicate that the dependence of aziridination efficacy on EA of active species is a quite general feature. To generalize this analysis, we reinvestigated a catalyst exhibiting a radical delocalization dominance. Indeed, a similar two-step mechanism was found, which involves a partial charge transfer in the C-N bond formation as all other cases. The interesting point is that owing to the strong steric hindrance of the catalyst substitution, the aziridine ring closure of the intermediate benzylic radical (second step) becomes rate-determining, thus explaining the dominance of the radical delocalization effect. Eventually, a general aziridination two-step mechanism has been rationalized, and EA thus appears as the key descriptor for Fe-based catalytic aziridination that can be used in a predictable way.									14	1	0	0	5	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700032

Significantly, K+-contained layered MnO2 catalysts have been verified as strong candidates toward catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO). Unveiling the effects of alkali metal ions on active sites is critical to understand the interaction between reactants and active centers. Through a combination of analytical tools with periodic computational density functional theory modeling, the surface structures and the exposing specific defects of alkali metal ions affiliated to oxygen vacancies (Vo) are figured out by comparing three typical alkali metal ion-intercalated (Na+, K+, and Cs+) layered MnO2 materials. These materials have been synthesized via a molten salt method, with high yield, large lateral size, and nanometer thickness in a few moments. We demonstrate that the alkali metal ions could remarkably alter the formation energy of Vo by the sequence of CsMnO (1.94 eV) < KMnO (1.97 eV) < NaMnO (2.07 eV) < ideal MnO2 surface without the intercalated ion (2.23 eV). As a result, CsMnO with the most surface Vo sites could achieve efficient HCHO oxidation to CO2, with a HCHO consumption rate of about 0.149 mmol/(g.h) at 40 degrees C in 200 ppm HCHO/humid air [gas hourly space velocity = 80,000 mL/(g.h)]. Different from the Mars-van-Krevelen process, quantum chemical calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy revealed that the main reaction pathway might be HCHO(ad) + [O](ad) -> DOM -> [HCOO-](s) -> CO2 via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. Alkali metals remarkably promoted the HCHO conversion by trapping oxygen through Vo sites and accelerating the facile reaction among adsorbed oxygen with adsorbed HCHO to deep degradation products (CO2 and H2O).									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700033

Herein, we report a carboxyl-directing strategy for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic gamma-ketoacids. With catalysis by iridium complexes bearing chiral spiro phosphino-oxazoline ligands, hydrogenation of aliphatic gamma-ketoacids afforded chiral gamma-hydroxylacids with high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). Mechanistic studies revealed that the carboxyl group of the substrate directs hydrogen transfer and ensures high enantioselectivity. Density functional theory calculations suggested the occurrence of chiral induction involving a hydrogen-hydrogen interaction between a hydride on the iridium atom and the substituent on the oxazoline ring of the ligand, and on the basis of the calculations, we proposed a catalytic cycle involving only Ir(III), which differs from the Ir(III)/Ir(V) catalytic cycle that operates in the hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acids.									6	2	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700034

These same agents can, however, strongly influence the catalytic performance of metal nanostructures in aqueous media. In this regard, the current literature describing the influence of ligands on the model catalytic reaction that sees 4-nitrophenol reduced to 4-aminophenol by borohydride is highly fragmented in that the understanding of reaction rate, induction time, and ligand desorption phenomena is disconnected and, at times, contradictory. Herein, we present a study in which three chemically distinct ligands are applied to bare gold catalysts followed by their exposure to aqueous solutions of relevance to 4-nitrophenol reduction while simultaneously tracking the ligand whereabouts. It is shown that the exposure of ligands to borohydride leads to their near-complete removal from the gold catalyst. This, in turn, gives rise to severe disruptions to the rate of 4-nitrophenol reduction for the scenario where the aqueous reactants are purged of dissolved oxygen and ligand desorption times are slow. In sharp contrast, the reaction rate is little affected when the same reactants contain dissolved oxygen because the resulting induction period provides ample time for the ligands to desorb prior to the onset of the reaction. Moreover, strongly bound ligands are shown to give rise to an induction-time-like feature that is only observable when the reactants are free of dissolved oxygen. Collectively, these findings advocate procedures for catalytic benchmarking that differ from current best practices and underscore the point that a fundamental understanding of 4-nitrophenol catalysis must adopt a holistic approach that accounts for ligand-nanostructure interdependencies.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700035

Catalysts with vanadium oxide (VOx) species immobilized over Zr-NU-1000 and Hf-MOF-808 (which have nodes containing six Zr-(IV) or Hf-(IV) ions, respectively) were recently characterized experimentally (Otake et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018, 140, 8652) and were reported to be active for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Here, we report a detailed computational investigation of these VOx-incorporated MOF catalysts (V-MOF) by employing density functional theory. Based on the mode of VOx attachment, various structures are explored, and their relative stabilities and computed IR spectral features are reported. Mechanisms for the selective oxidation reaction are investigated. The analysis of electron flow in the turnover-limiting C-H activation step shows that the hydrogen-atom abstraction process involves a concerted proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism. The results of this study suggest that in addition to the identity of the metal in the node, the MOF node architecture plays a crucial role in driving the catalytic activities of V-MOFs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700036

The active sites in this solid solution m-ZrO2:In catalyst are In-V-o-Zr sites (V-o is an oxygen vacancy) that are stabilized in the lattice of poorly reducible m-ZrO2 against deactivation by over-reduction to In-0. In contrast, the amorphous ZrO2 support does not form a (crystalline) solid solution with In2O3 and, as a result, In2O3/am-ZrO2 reduces to metallic In within minutes under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, a tetragonal ZrO2 support stabilizes dispersed india nanocrystals (In2O3/t-ZrO2) against over-reduction only partially, yielding a catalyst with an average oxidation state of the In sites below +2: i.e., In2O3/t-ZrO2 also suffers deactivation by over-reduction. Our results demonstrate that the phase of the ZrO2 support determines whether an active solid solution with india forms, which has major implications for the reducibility of In3+ sites and their local structure. Comparing the stability and activity of india-based catalysts, we identified the monoclinic solid solution m-ZrO2:In as a superior catalyst for the direct conversion of CO2 to methanol, which contains active In-V-o-Zr surface species that are significantly more stable toward reduction than In-V-o-In sites in bixbyite-type In2O3.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700037

The unique physical and chemical properties of a single-atomic structure and the homogeneity of the active sites, combined with tunable coordination environments, are essential for realizing highly active and selective catalysts. In this Review, we focus on the structure-performance relationship in SMA catalysts for CO2 reduction from both theoretical and experimental aspects. We discuss why SMA catalysts exhibit a distinct catalytic performance compared to their counterpart nanoparticles. Recent strategies for improving the CO2 reduction selectivity and activity by tuning the nature and coordination environment of SMA active sites are described. Finally, we highlight potential applications of SMA catalysts in practical CO2 reduction conditions, critical challenges, and the path toward efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysis based on SMAs.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700038

The present study demonstrates that the sizes and dispersion of oxidized Pd islands present on oxidized Ag(111) in addition to the concentration of active Pd sites have a significant influence on the rate of surface reduction by H-2. Two distinct types of Pd oxide islands were generated for this investigation and characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy. Small, uniformly dispersed PdOx islands (1-5 nm diameter) were created by depositing Pd onto AgOx surfaces, while larger, non-uniformly dispersed PdOx agglomerates (30-50 nm) were produced by depositing Pd on Ag(111) prior to oxidizing. Based on XPS, the small PdOx islands have a higher concentration of undercoordinated Pd atoms than the large agglomerates. Both types of PdOx are found to dramatically enhance the reduction of AgOx by H-2 at 300 K due to the ability of PdOx to dissociate H-2; the pure AgOx surfaces are unreactive toward H-2. The rate of reduction at 300 K is found to be 2-4 times larger for the AgOx surface covered by small, uniformly dispersed PdOx islands. The higher reactivity of this surface is attributed to enhanced migration of oxygen and hydrogen atoms between the PdOx and AgOx phases due to the sizes and high dispersion of the small PdO islands as well as the higher concentration of active Pd sites on the PdOx domains. This study demonstrates that reactant migration between co-existing surface phases is highly sensitive to both the intrinsic chemical activity and morphological properties of the active phase (PdOx) and reveals that these properties can be significantly influenced by the method of synthesizing the oxidized bimetallic surfaces.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700040

From a cheap and air-stable [Fe(salen)](2)-mu-oxo complex and readily available pinacol borane (HBpin), a monomeric [FeH(salen)]center dot Bpin species formed in situ acts as the active catalyst. This species is shown to feature a hemilabile salen ligand stabilized via interactions with the boron entity. The formation, identity, and reaction mechanism of the active species are supported by complementary kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational data. The active catalyst undergoes hydrometallation of a coordinated alkyne to form a vinyl iron species, stepwise additions of two more alkynes across the Fe-C bond to form a pendant triene, which upon ring-closure forms the arene product. The catalytic cycle is closed by substitution of the product with the alkyne substrate. With the active [FeH(salen)]center dot Bpin catalyst, atom-efficient, intermolecular trimerization is shown with high regioselectivity for a diverse range of substrate substitution patterns and presence of functional groups.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700044

The rates of epoxidation, however, differ by orders of magnitude depending on the combination of an oxidant, an alkene, and a support used. Within Ti-BEA, the rates of 1-octene epoxidation with H2O2 are 30 and 170 times greater than reactions with TBHP or CHP, respectively. In contrast, 1-octene epoxidation rates in Ti-SBA-15 with H2O2 are 7- and 40-fold higher than in reactions with TBHP or CHP, respectively. Moreover, comparisons of 1-alkene (C-6-C-10) epoxidations within Ti-BEA and Ti-SBA-15 show that the turnover rates depend differently on the length of alkene reactants depending on the oxidant identity, which is due to complex interactions among the alkene, the activated oxidant, and the solvent-filled pore of the Ti-silicate. Thermochemical analyses of apparent activation free energies within a Born-Haber cycle reveal three distinct contributions that affect catalysis, which include charge transfer between Ti-OOR and C=C functions within the transition state; the adsorption of the alkene into the silicate pores; and the structural rearrangement of the reactive Ti-OOR intermediates and solvent to accommodate the alkene. First, epoxidations with H2O2 give the highest rates among these oxidants because Ti-OOH intermediates are more electrophilic than Ti-OOtBu or Ti-OOcumyl species as a consequence of electron donation from alkyl groups that increase intrinsic barriers for O-atom transfer. Second, differences in the epoxidation rates between Ti-BEA and Ti-SBA-15 largely reflect the changes in the stability of the alkenes adsorbed within the pores of each silicate. Third, the distinct sensitivities of epoxidation rates on oxidant identity within Ti-BEA and Ti-SBA-15 are caused by differences between the inner-sphere interactions among Ti-OOR intermediates and adsorbed alkenes that depend on the surrounding environment. We present a thermodynamic model that quantitatively describes how inner-sphere interactions among epoxidation transition states depend on the steric bulk of the reacting species and how these interactions are conferred by the topology of the surrounding pore. The mesopores of Ti-SBA-15 allow transition states to access conformations that lower the free energy of the complex relative to analogous transition states in Ti-BEA, which explains why epoxidation rates in mesoporous solids are less sensitive to the identity of the oxidant than within microporous silicates.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700045

Isolated Ru sites were successfully implanted into the structure of the MOF by simply stirring the mixed liquor containing both MOF and RuCl3, facilitating plasma discharge, NO/NO2 adsorption, and formation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals. A special oxo-bridged Zr4+-O-Ru3+ was constructed to accelerate electron transfer and continuous proceeding of the reaction. Directional migration of generated electrons from MOF to Ru sites was witnessed when MOF was activated by plasma-induced "pseudo-photocatalysis". The total (100%) selective plasma-catalytic oxidation of NOx to NO2- and NO3- was achieved at an SIE of 75.3 J/L. The byproduct O-3 was effectively degraded and utilized by MnO2, facilitating the deep oxidation of NOx. The facile realization of single atoms would be an ideal way to produce MOF-based catalysts with desired performance. Efficiently combining plasma with single atom-decorated MOF catalysts can provide additional prospects for the plasma-catalytic system.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700046

Here, we report our findings in electrochemical NRR for ammonia synthesis using porous bimetallic Pd-Ag nanocatalysts in both gas-phase and liquid-phase electrochemical cells at current densities above 1 mA cm(-2) under ambient conditions. While the gas-phase cell has lower Ohmic losses and higher energy efficiency, the liquid-phase cell achieved higher selectivity and Faradaic efficiency, attributed to the presence of concentrated N-2 molecules dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte and the hydration effects. The liquid cell demonstrated notable performance for electrocatalytic NRR, achieving an NH3 production rate of 45.6 +/- 3.7 mu g cm(-2) h(-1) at a cell voltage of -0.6 V (vs RHE) and current density of 1.1 mA cm(-2), corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 19.6% and an energy efficiency of similar to 9.9%. Similarly, the gas-phase cell achieved a NH3 yield rate of 19.4 +/- 2.1 mu g cm(-2) h(-1) at -0.07 V (vs RHE) and 1.15 mA cm(-2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 7.9% and an energy efficiency of 27.1%. Further, operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) are used to identify intermediate species relevant to the NRR at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces to provide insights into the NRR mechanism on Pd-Ag nanoparticles. This work highlights the importance of design and optimization of cell configuration in addition to the modification of the catalyst to achieve high-performance N-2 electrolysis for ammonia synthesis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700047

This problem is particularly complex for reactions that occur at the metal-support interface (MSI) because of the multiple chemistries associated with the metal and the support. In this study, we used the oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohol over Au/TiO2 and Au/Al2O3 to probe MSI chemistry. Substituents impacted substrate binding, deprotonation, and the rate-limiting transfer of a hydride from benzyl alcohol to Au, as shown by a combination of Michaelis-Menten (M-M) saturation kinetics and kinetic isotope effects. Hammett studies performed with a single substrate versus those done with two substrates together in competition experiments showed significant differences, which were attributable to stronger competitive adsorption on the support by more electron-rich alcohols. The M-M analysis showed that alcohol substitution impacts substrate binding and deprotonation equilibria, which in turn affect the number of active alkoxides adsorbed at the MSI. Hammett slopes should therefore be measured under saturating conditions using one substrate at a time. The Hammett slopes measured for heterogeneous systems in this manner agree well with the KIE-Hammett slope relationship determined in homogeneous systems, which provide information on the early or late nature of the transition state. Our results show that the combination of Michaelis-Menten and Hammett techniques for benzyl alcohol oxidation provides mechanistic information associated with the MSI chemistry of supported Au catalysts as well as information on active site electronics.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700048

The concentration of copper was varied between 0 and 10 wt %, while the concentration of CeO2 was varied between 0 and 48 wt % in several permutations of Cu/CeO2/ZSM-5 catalysts. RWGS reactivity trends revealed that all three components of the catalyst system are essential for promoting and sustaining the optimum catalytic activity. The dynamic chemical states of copper and cerium were probed using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure), revealing reduced copper and mostly oxidized ceria in the active state. In situ X-ray diffraction data revealed the presence of copper aggregates, as well as copper within the ZSM-5 lattice. In situ and isotopic switching diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy analyses were used to unambiguously establish copper speciation within the ZSM-5 lattice and CeO2 surface sites as participatory in the RWGS mechanism, with surface formate species on CeO2 being a reaction intermediate. Based on a robust set of real-time structural, electronic, and surface chemical data, we proposed a reaction mechanism that involves the participation of all three components of this catalyst system.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700049

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission CO-IR of the reduced catalyst, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy are used to identify the surface structure of NPs with different P/Ru atomic ratios, changing from Ru to Ru2P to RuP with increasing P loading. In addition to improving the olefin selectivity, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to higher turnover rates and lowers the deactivation rate. P is thought to act as a structural promoter to reduce the Ru ensemble size, decreasing the hydrogenolysis rate. In addition, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to a decrease in the energy of the Ru valence orbitals, which are suggested to weaken metal-adsorbate bond energies and reactant surface coverages.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700051

Finally, a summary of photocatalytic applications and a perspective on future research direction have been discussed. Based on the research progress in this field, it is highly anticipated that the photocatalytic systems, comprising perovskite oxide materials along with groundbreaking technologies for large-scale realization of these processes, can be established in the near future to address the energy and environment-oriented challenges.									50	1	0	0	4	0	51			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700052

Recently, two types of biosynthetic pathways were reported. In the aerobic ergothioneine biosyntheses, non-heme iron enzymes incorporate a sulfoxide into an sp(2) C-H bond from trimethyl-histidine (hercynine) through oxidation reactions. In contrast, in the anaerobic ergothioneine biosynthetic pathway in a green-sulfur bacterium, Chlorobium limicola, a rhodanese domain containing protein (EanB), directly replaces this unreactive hercynine C-H bond with a C-S bond. Herein, we demonstrate that polysulfide (HSSnSR) is the direct sulfur source in EanB catalysis. After identifying EanB's substrates, X-ray crystallography of several intermediate states along with mass spectrometry results provide additional mechanistic details for this reaction. Further, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations reveal that the protonation of N-pi of hercynine by Tyr353 with the assistance of Thr414 is a key activation step for the hercynine sp(2) C-H bond in this trans-sulfuration reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900002	34306804

We identified three OSCs from Iris tectorum. ItOSC2 is a rare multifunctional alpha-amyrin synthase. Sequence comparisons, site-directed mutagenesis, and multiscale simulations revealed that three spatially clustered residues, Y531/L256/L258, form an unusual Y-LL triad at the active site, replacing the highly conserved W-xY triad occurring in other amyrin synthases. The discovery of this active site architecture in ItOSC2 underscores the plasticity of terpene cyclase catalytic mechanisms and opens avenues for protein engineering toward custom designed OSCs.									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900046	34306805

Computational analysis indicates that the triplet excited state of these complexes shows an oxyl radical behavior, while the Sb-V center remains in a high-valent oxidation state, serving uniquely to carry the oxo moiety and activate the coordinated ligands. This porphyrin-based system has been exploited upon irradiation to catalyze C-H to C-C bond conversion via the addition of hydrogen donors (ethers and aldehydes) onto Michael acceptors in a redox-neutral fashion without the need of any external oxidant. Laser flash photolysis experiments confirmed that the triplet excited state of the photocatalyst triggers the desired C-H cleavage.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900008	33815891

The definition of the IMC catalysts allowed for more direct connections to be made between catalyst bulk and surface compositions and catalyst performance in wet reforming. We show that Ni + Ga catalysts exhibit comparable or better rates of reaction on a per-site basis and improved stability in comparison to other leading formulations. We also demonstrate excellent control over product selectivity as a function of Ni + Ga IMC bulk and surface compositions with nearly ideal selectivity toward CO2/H-2 or CO/H-2 achieved. Selectivity toward the production of smaller hydrocarbons could also be suppressed significantly due to uniquely limited rehydrogenation kinetics of the Ni + Ga IMCs. Our studies also shed light on the stability of Ni + Ga IMCs under reaction conditions and how high conversion in reactions that involve many strongly bound reaction intermediates can lead to IMC phase relaxation to the most stable phase with concomitant surface composition and catalytic performance changes. Correlations between surface chemistry and catalyst performance were afforded by both the well-defined nature of the IMCs and computational surface science studies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900001

However, the specific roles of such supports remain to be demystified owing to the difficulties in obtaining precise structural information on supported catalysts. To understand the effects of MOF topology, pore environment, and metal identity of node supports on the catalytic activity, a Ni catalyst was supported on eight Zr- or Hf-MOFs based on 8-connected nodes: namely M-NU-1200, M-NU-1000, M-NU-1008, and M-NU-1010 (M = Zr, Hf). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the supported catalyst structures. To investigate the support effects on their activities, the supported Ni catalysts were evaluated by using ethylene hydrogenation as a model reaction. The results revealed that all Hf-based-MOF-supported Ni catalysts exhibited higher catalytic reactivity with TOF (turnover frequency) values at least double of those isostructural Zr counterparts. Additionally, MOFs with less congested metal anchoring sites, as a result of the topology and surrounding pore environment, yielded higher TOFs, suggesting the importance of supports in dictating both the catalyst accessibility and activity. Computational analysis complemented the experimental observations and provided insights into reaction barrier differences and their performance variation.

H-2 Evolution at an Electrochemical "Underpotential" with an Iridium-Based Molecular Photoelectrocatalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	16			9006	9018		10.1021/acscatal.0c02265				AUG 21 2020	2020	Molecular platforms capable of both photochemical H-2 evolution and electrochemical catalyst regeneration hold promise for the efficient generation of solar fuels. Systems studied to date require a significant electrochemical overpotential (eta), so no photon energy is being chemically stored. A detailed study of the parameters that govern the electrochemical overpotential of molecular photoelectrocatalysts is presented. By understanding how tuning the solvent, catalyst structure, and acid pK(a) affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of the potential- and light-driven H-2 evolution reaction, conditions were identified wherein the solvento complex [Cp*Ir(bpy)(NCCH3)][PF6](2) (Cp* is pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl; bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine) mediates photoelectrocatalytic H-2 formation at an electrochemical "underpotential" (eta < 0) driven by visible light. Under 460 nm illumination and in the presence of the weak organic acid H-PhTMG(+) (2-phenyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidinium), the catalyst facilitates H-2 evolution with Faradaic efficiencies up to 90% and overpotentials as low as -90 mV. Mechanistic studies enabled the construction of graphical "maps" that can guide the choice of catalyst and conditions to minimize overpotential, applicable to both photoelectrocatalysts and dark electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900004

In this work, TiO2-x was employed to regulate active Fe species to the electron-rich state, causing remarkable synergetic effects in which the sulfur removal rates of Fe-based catalysts were increased by 10-40% and reaction rate constants were also increased by around 100% (pure Fe-based catalysts) and 30% (Fe-Zn bimetallic catalysts). The results of characterization and DFT calculations show that the strong electron-donating effect of TiO2-x on Fe species can promote the dispersion of Fe species and weaken the Fe-O and Fe-S/FeZn-S bonds, resulting in the increases in sulfidation degrees by around 3.5% and enrichments of coordinatively unsaturated sites or sulfur vacancies. In addition, weaker Al-OH peaks caused by TiO2 can also facilitate the increase in sulfidation degrees of Fe-based catalysts. Furthermore, hydrodesulfurization/direct desulfurization ratios are decreased by adding TiO2-x, attributed to the electron-rich Fe species that makes C-S bonds and alpha/beta-H more vulnerable to attacks. Slight changes in acidity caused by TiO2-x have little effect on the catalytic performances of Fe-based catalysts. This work lays a solid foundation for industrial application of eco-friendly and economical Fe-based catalysts in the HDS field.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900005

However, owing to unsuitable redox capacity, most NH3-SCR catalysts such as MnO2/TiO2 and MnO2-CeO2/TiO2 suffer from poor activity and N-2 selectivity and SO2 poisoning. Benefiting from constructing mesoporous MnCeSmTiOx amorphous mixed oxides by the coprecipitation method, enhanced SO2-tolerant low-temperature NH3-SCR performance was achieved. The MnCeSmTiOx catalysts have an amorphous and mesoporous structure with a BET surface area of 214 m(2) .g(-1). The NO conversion could reach nearly 100% at 140-320 degrees C and maintain >90% at 400 degrees C and a gas hourly space velocity of 80,000h(-1). The selectivity of N-2 could be maintained at approximate to 100% at 100-320 degrees C and stay at >90% up to 400 degrees C. Besides, the MnCeSmTiOx catalyst preserves higher catalytic performance after introducing H2O and SO2 compared with the catalysts without adding Sm. The redox properties, acidic properties, and reaction intermediates of catalysts were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption, oxygen temperature-programmed desorption, pyridine-IR, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform. The synergistic effect of the Lewis acid sites and oxidation catalytic sites of mixed oxides serves for the conversion of NO to N-2 by following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. Doping Sm into MnCeSmTiOx can increase oxygen vacancies and transfer electrons to Mn4+ and Ce4+, which facilities the formation of active adsorbed NO2, bidentate nitrate, and bridging nitrate intermediates and suppresses SO2 poisoning by inhibiting the oxidation of SO2 by Mn4+ and Ce4+. Our work could be beneficial to modulate the redox capacity of active sites on NH3-SCR catalysts so that NOx can be eliminated in complex flue gas at low temperatures.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900006

These indude molecular homogeneous catalysts incorporating various ligands, enzymes, and solids that include pairs of metal atoms mounted on supports. Catalysts in this broad class are active for numerous reactions and offer unexplored opportunities to address challenging reactions, such as oxidation of methane and oxidation of water in artificial photosynthesis. The subject of supported metal pair-site catalysts is in its infancy, facing challenges in (a) precise synthesis, (b) structure determination at the atomic scale, and (c) stabilization in reactive atmospheres. In this Perspective, we summarize key characteristics of molecular and enzymatic catalysts that incorporate neighboring metal centers and build on this foundation to assess the emerging literature of metal pair-site catalysts on various supports. The supported catalysts include those synthesized by anchoring molecular dinuclear precursors to support surfaces and those synthesized by selective formation of dinuclear surface species from mononuclear surface species. Examples of metals in this dass are rhodium and iridium, and examples of supports are MgO and Fe2O3. We summarize characterization of these materials by electron microscopy and spectroscopy, emphasizing atomic-resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopies that provide atomic-scale structural information and allow characterization of functioning catalysts, especially X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We list some opportunities for research, including suggestions that might lead to structurally well-defined supported metal pair-sites with new catalytic properties.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900009

Monometallic phosphides such as Ni2P have been shown to be active toward OER, but their performance remains unsatisfactory. Herein, guided by the theoretical mechanism study of the intrinsic high electroactivity revealed in the d-band center (E-d) theory, the Fe-substituted Ni2P ((NixFe1-x)(2)P) nanosheets grown directly on NiFe foam are designed and synthesized. As OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media, the (NixFe1-x)(2)P nanosheets show an overpotential of 166 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the Ni2P and most reported transition-metal-based catalysts. Combining DFT simulations with experiments reveals that the enhanced activity results from the moderate rise in E-d energy levels, which balances the adsorption and desorption capacities of the oxygen-containing intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH). This work supplies valuable insights for the rational design and construction of efficient doped electrocatalysts under the guidance of the d-band center theory.									43	0	0	0	2	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900010

However, the interpretation of the structure-reactivity relationship caused by different crystal types of carriers and the metal-support interface is not well understood. Herein we synthesized ZrO2 -supported Cu nanoparticle catalysts via different preparation methods and reduction temperatures under similarly exposed surface facets and Cu valency but different polymorphic phases of ZrO2 (monoclinic ZrO2: m-ZrO2; tetragonal ZrO2: t-ZrO2) and the metal-support interface. Interestingly, the as-synthesized Cu/t-ZrO2 catalysts showed remarkably better catalytic performance than Cu/m-ZrO2 for the in situ hydrogenation of lauric acid in the methanol-water system. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results ascribed the lower efficiency of m-ZrO2 as a carrier to weakly adsorbed reactant and intermediate molecules as well as the absence of an oxygen vacancy in the crystal phase. The interface-rich Cu/t-ZrO2 catalysts displayed higher activity normalized to the surface-exposed Cu sites toward lauryl alcohol production than the interface-deficient counterparts. DFT calculation results further revealed that this metal-support interface plays an important role in promoting the C-O bond or H-H bond cleavage in two possible reaction routes, thus reducing the activation barrier of the overall reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900011

However, the difficulty in activating the methyl group of biomass and simultaneously promoting the C-C coupling makes photocatalytic reforming still a great challenge. Herein, through the first-principles simulation calculation of the energy barrier of acetone dehydrogenation and conversion over a series of noble metal single atom (Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au)-loaded TiO2 (MSA-TiO2) photocatalysts, we predict a Pt single atom-loaded TiO2 (PtSA-TiO2) photocatalyst that can enable methyl activation, CH3COCH2 center dot radical formation, and hydrogen production most effectively from acetone, which is very significant for the synthesis of high-value-added multicarbon compounds by C-C coupling. This is well confirmed by our photocatalytic experiments, revealing that PtSA-loaded commercial P25-TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic activity of 3.87 mmol g(-1)h(-1) for the direct coproduction of high-value-added 2,5-hexanedione (HDN) and hydrogen from acetone with a selectivity of 93%, at least 13-fold higher activity than other noble metal (Ru, Rh, and Ir) single atoms or Pt nanoparticle-loaded ones. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy reveals that the PtSAs contribute to the effective methyl activation and simultaneously promote the formation of more intermediate CH3COCH2 center dot radicals, which are further confirmed by in situ electron spin resonance spectroscopy.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900012

Determinations of rates of catalyzed alcohol oxidations and ketone reductions, and of cofactor release, pointed out to the role of a W295A substitution as being decisive in steering enantioselectivity in the oxidation of arylated 1-methyl substituted alcohols. Molecular dynamics simulations of enzyme-substrate interactions in the Michaelis complexes of wild-type ADH-A and a Y294F/W295A double mutant could rationalize the experimentally observed shift in enantioselectivity and differences in catalytic activity with 4-phenyl-2-butanol. Finally, we present herein evidence for apparent interdependency between substrate/product and the cofactor in the ternary complex, which directly affects the NADH dissociation rates; therefore, this substrate-coenzyme crosstalk plays a direct role in determining the turnover rates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900013

Different transition metals have been screened using electronic structure methods by estimating onset potentials from the most endergonic elementary reaction step. We calculate onset potentials for the oxygen reduction reaction on metal atoms embedded in N-substituted graphene di-vacancies by virtue of first-principles-informed microkinetic analysis. We find that for more oxophilic metals (Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ru), purely thermodynamic models systematically underestimate onset potentials. Furthermore, the oxophilic metals (Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ru) are oxidized under reaction conditions, leading to an increase in activity compared to their reduced state. Importantly, coadsorbed OmHn species actively participate in the reaction, which requires a dynamic treatment of spectator species. These findings highlight the limitations of thermodynamic analyses for electrocatalytic processes, which commonly assume the same oxidation state for each metal, and show that deviations between computational and experimental onset potentials cannot be solely attributed to the shortcomings of the electronic structure methods.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900014

Extensive synthesis and step-wise screening of over 600 dipeptide derivatives were performed for the efficient evolution of decoy molecules. In the presence of N-(3-cyclopentyl)propanoyl-L-pipecolyl-L-phenylalanine (3CPPA-Pip-Phe), one of the most effective decoy molecules discovered herein, the catalytic turnover frequency and total turnover number for benzene hydroxylation reached 405 min(-1) P450BM3(-1) and 54,500 P450BM3(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the decoy molecules developed in this work drastically accelerated the hydroxylation of other non-native substrates, such as anisole and toluene, as well as nonaromatic compounds, such as cyclohexane, propane, and ethane.

Biocatalysis is preferred as it can be performed under mild reaction conditions, in an aqueous environment, and can involve benign oxidants (molecular oxygen) and biodegradable catalysts (enzymes and cells). Whole cells and isolated enzymes have both been demonstrated effectively catalyze the biotransformation of HMF (5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural) to FDCA. Whole cell biocatalysts are robust and benefit from endogenously produced cofactors (which are otherwise expensive stoichiometric reagents). However, wild-type organisms suffer from catabolic pathways which yield many side products and catabolize FDCA. Thus, whole cells require metabolic modification to favor certain pathways and eliminate others to be viable. With clear pathways and simple reaction conditions, isolated enzymes allow for better control and easier product recovery. However, no individual enzyme effectively catalyzes the full oxidation of HMF to FDCA, and thus, cofactors, mediators, immobilization, mutation, or cooperation with other enzymes is employed to achieve complete oxidation. Herein, a comprehensive review of the biocatalytic methods for converting HMF to FDCA is presented. Moreover, general strategies for alcohol and aldehyde oxidation are also discussed to provide a more complete context.									10	0	1	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900016

Distinct from the extensively developed photoredox catalysis, in which the photocatalyst generally does not directly participate in a bond-forming process, and photocatalyst/TM synergistic catalysis, in which the photocatalyst absorbs photon energy and transfers energy to the TM catalyst through a redox or energy transfer process, this Review focuses on summarizing the recent developments of photocatalytic reactions that use TM complexes to both absorb visible light and participate in catalytic bond formation involving a catalyst covalently bonded intermediate. The contents of this Review are categorized by the transition metal used (Pd, Cu, Co, Ni, Mn, Au, Rh, Fe, Ru), with a descending sequence according to the number of examples reported of each metal, and provide an overview of TM catalysis under visible light reported to April 2020.

Herein, a zinc-modified ultrastable Y (USY) zeolite containing higher Bronsted acidity was prepared by synergistic treatment with zinc chloride and steaming. The results of characterization showed that selective dealumination and silicon healing due to introduction of zinc ions ([ZnCl](+) and [ZnOH](+)) into zeolite could promote the formation of extra-framework silicon (EFS) and different silicon healing of the Al vacancies, which led to the formation of half-sodalite cages connecting with supercages and thus increased the availability of acidic sites in the sodalite cage. Meanwhile, DFT calculations demonstrated that the acidic strength of protons in the sodalite cage was enhanced by [ZnCl](+) and [ZnOH](+), and the synergy of Bronsted/[ZnCl](+) became stronger. As a result, the strong Bronsted acid was increased by 19%. This translated to higher n-octane and heavy oil (VGO) catalytic cracking activity and gasoline yield.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900018

It is found that the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channels is energetically more favored than the individual sinusoidal and straight channels due to their different local environments. On the basis of the computed Gibbs free energy at 500 degrees C, the rate-determining step for the formation of 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene as the first intermediate is the heterolytic activation of H-2, which is encapsulated in a conjugated frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), generated from the acidic O-H proton transfer to the hydrocarbon substrate. For the subsequent formation of toluene or benzene and o-xylene from 1-benzyl-2-methylbenzene hydrocracking, the rate-determining step, which is the heterolytic activation of H-2 encapsulated in a conjugated FLP, determines the selectivity.

Nevertheless, water as a more abundant and ecofriendly hydrogen source has hardly been used due to the high difficulty in splitting water molecules. Herein, we designed a photocatalytic water-donating transfer hydrogenation (PWDTH) technique, in which hydrogen was extracted from water under light illumination and then in situ added to different unsaturated bonds (C=C, C=O, N=O) for chemical synthesis. Platinum-loaded carbon nitride (Pt/CN) was used as the model catalyst for this cascade reaction, which is beyond its normal applications for water splitting. This approach was highly accessible to efficiency optimization, either by modifying CN for extended light absorption and enhanced charge transfer or by alloying Pt with another metal for better catalytic activities. Remarkably, a quantum efficiency of up to 21.8% was achieved for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under 380 nm irradiation, which is 3 times higher than that obtained in the single water-splitting reaction, indicating that the PWDTH can be more rewarding than hydrogen evolution for solar energy harvesting. Deep insights into the underlying mechanism were provided by detailed measurements and interpretations of femtosecond transient absorption spectra, action spectra (quantum efficiency as a function of excitation wavelength), and reaction kinetic profiles under varied conditions including the variation of light intensities, temperatures, and water isotopes. The mild reaction conditions, simple processing, and broad substituent group tolerance endow this approach with a high potential toward a general solar-to-chemical conversion technique.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900020

Special attention is paid to the role of anharmonicity (a result of collective phenomena) and the deviations from the standard harmonic oscillator approximations, which can fail to provide a reliable assessment of entropy. To address these challenges, advanced methodologies are needed that can explicitly account for these thermodynamic drivers through the appropriate statistical sampling of reactive free-energy surfaces. We discuss where anharmonicity should be expected, where it has been observed from a theoretical perspective, and the methods currently employed to address it. We concentrate on three types of systems where we have observed major, non-negligible anharmonic effects: (1) supported nanoparticles, where the migration of metal atoms, complexes, and entire clusters exhibit anharmonic behavior in their dynamic motion; (2) porous solids, where confinement effects distort potential energy surfaces and hinder molecular motions, resulting in large entropic terms; and (3) solid/liquid interfaces, where interactions between solvent molecules and adsorbed species can result in large solvent organization free energy and unique reactivity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900021

Here, we demonstrate the interplay between the catalyst structure and CO2 hydrogenation on Cu catalysts boosted with nickel species. The nickel dispersion on copper markedly affects the CO2 dissociation activity and catalytic reaction pathways, thus resulting in distinctive catalytic activity and selectivity attributed to Ni. Specifically, the catalyst incorporating nickel alloyed in copper maximizes the synergy between the two metals and is characterized by conversions close to the thermodynamic equilibrium to CO as a product-with switched off methanation-over a wide temperature range. Catalyst performance data, spectra characterizing the catalyst, and theoretical results demonstrate that surface copper with adjacent nickel atoms efficiently activates CO2 via a redox mechanism-with adsorption of CO being suppressed-so that methanation associated with deep hydrogenation of CO is inhibited. The results of this investigation highlight the importance of structures with copper-adjacent-nickel, which appear to offer appealing opportunities for tailoring efficient copper-containing catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900022

However, unmodified Cu exhibits poor selectivity and activity for formate production. Our in situ Raman spectroscopy study detects HCOO* intermediates on the unmodified Cu surface under CO2 electroreduction reaction conditions and confirms their reductive desorption being the rate-limiting step of producing formate. We further show that cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) can dramatically improve the catalysis via competitive adsorption to facilitate HCOO* desorption. The Cu-CTAB interaction leads to a faradic efficiency of 82% and a 56-fold increase in partial current density for CO2 reduction to formate at -0.5 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode in a near-neutral aqueous solution, which is the best performance to date for unmodified Cu under ambient conditions.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900023

The studied reaction was found to involve three sequential steps: (i) protonation of the substrate's N2 atom by Lys893, (ii) nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) to the substrate, and (iii) hydride transfer from the substrate to the sulfur atom of the Moco. The free energy profile that was calculated revealed that the rate-limiting step corresponds to hydride transfer. It was also found that Lys893 plays a relevant role in the reaction, being important not only for the anchorage of the substrate close to the Moco, but also in the catalytic reaction. The variations of the oxidation state of the molybdenum ion throughout the catalytic cycle were examined too. We found out that during the displacement of the products away from the Moco, the transfer of electrons from the catalytic site to the FAD site was proton-coupled. As a consequence, the most favorable and fastest pathway for the enzyme to complete its catalytic cycle was that with Mo-v and a deprotonated SH ligand of the Moco with the FAD molecule converted to its semiquinone form, FADH(center dot).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900024

Its biological activity relies on three aromatic cross-links, which create a cup-shaped topology and allow tight binding to nascent peptidoglycan chains. The cytochrome P450 enzymes OxyB, OxyA, and OxyC have been shown to introduce these synthetically challenging aromatic linkages. The ability to utilize the P450 enzymes in a chemo-enzymatic scheme to generate vancomycin derivatives is appealing but requires a thorough understanding of their reactivities and mechanisms. Herein, we systematically explore the scope of OxyB biocatalysis and report installation of diverse diaryl ether and biaryl cross-links with varying macrocycle sizes and compositions, when the enzyme is presented with modified vancomycin precursor peptides. The structures of the resulting products were determined using one-dimensional/two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), tandem HR-MS, and isotopic labeling, as well as ultraviolet-visible light absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopies. An exploration of the biological activities of these alternative OxyB products surprisingly revealed antifungal properties. Taking advantage of the promiscuity of OxyB, we chemo-enzymatically generated a vancomycin aglycone variant containing an expanded macrocycle. Mechanistic implications for OxyB and future directions for creating vancomycin analogue libraries are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900025	34422446

Due to the high demand for PVC, this leads to ethylene oxychlorination being one of the most important processes in the industry. This Review covers an indepth analysis of the dynamic nature of active sites for the main and side reactions involved in ethylene oxychlorination, featuring the findings and viewpoints from the dynamic kinetics study and analysis under industrial operating conditions. A unified picture of the mechanism of the surface reactions, and the effect of supports and promoters, has been presented based on the decoupled redoxcycle experiments, which leads to a significantly better understanding of the mechanism and provides valuable guidelines for effective catalyst design. Operando techniques and kinetic tools of the rate-diagram, as well as their application to the study of the redox-cycle in ethylene oxychlorination and kinetic models on both the main product and byproduct, are also reviewed. Perspectives on challenges and new process development and future research focus for better study of the VCM production chemistry are also proposed.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900026

Among other technologies, denitrification of runoff streams via electrocatalysis is a promising solution, but a lack of fundamental insights into the relevant reaction mechanisms and a limited understanding of the molecular-level factors that control selectivity to desired products have hindered progress. Previous work suggests that, while Pt electrocatalysts produce primarily undesirable ammonium (NH4+) products from electrochemical NOx reduction at room temperature, addition of promoters such as Sn may tune the solution-phase product selectivity to yield a mixture of hydroxylamine (NH3OH+) and ammonium. To elucidate the atomic-scale features responsible for this significant selectivity shift, we investigate the reaction mechanism for NO electroreduction on Pt3Sn(111) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations combined with detailed treatments of surface ensemble, coverage, and solvation effects. High coverages of NO* on the catalyst surface (up to 5/9 ML) are explicitly considered to mimic experimental reaction conditions and to ascertain the effect of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reaction mechanism. Activation barriers for electrochemical reduction and N-O cleavage in adsorbed NO* and subsequent reaction intermediates, as well as chemical N-O bond breaking in similar species, are determined using a combination of transition state search algorithms and explicit electrochemical double-layer models. The resulting reaction free energy landscape highlights the importance of both interactions between the adsorbed reaction intermediates and NO* and solvation effects in promoting hydroxylamine production over ammonium on Pt-Sn alloys. Such effects lead to enhanced stability of the HNO* reaction intermediate, in comparison to pure Pt, and to its subsequent conversion to hydroxylamine. The results provide a compact interpretation of how Sn alters the product selectivity during NO electroreduction on Pt and point to design principles by which selectivity may be controlled in denitrification and related electrocatalytic processes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900027

The pseudohexagonal Ta2O5 (TT-Ta2O5) synthesized by a hydrothermal method showed the highest catalytic activity for CO oxidation as a support for gold catalysts. The temperature at 50% CO conversion was -11 degrees C for 1 wt % Au/TT-Ta2O5, and the temperature was 23 degrees C at 100% CO conversion (space velocity of 20000 mL h(-1 )g(cat)(-1)). To investigate the reaction mechanism, in situ performed, and the sequential delivery of adsorbed CO on Ta2O5 sites and Au sites to the active sites was observed at -120 degrees C. The results of temperature-programmed CO reduction suggested that the oxygen adsorbed at -100 degrees C contributed mainly to the high catalytic activity of CO oxidation, while the lattice oxygen played a minor role for CO oxidation from -60 to 100 degrees C, which was the same temperature range with the actual reaction condition.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900028

However, the determination and interpretation of the apparent activation energy in multistep reactions is not an easy task. For this purpose, concepts based on the definition of degree of rate control are convenient, which comprise mathematical approaches for analyzing reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics. Although these concepts have been used in catalysis, they have not yet been quantitatively applied in electrocatalytic systems, whose ability to control the potential across the solid/liquid interface is the main difference with heterogeneous catalysis, and the electrical current is commonly used as a measure of the reaction rate. Herein, we use the definitions of sensitivities and kinetic degree of rate control to address some of the drawbacks that frequently arise with interpreting apparent activation energy as a measure of intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of an electrode. For this, a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-like electrokinetic model is used for making numerical experiments and verifying the proposed ideas. The results show that, to improve the catalytic activity of an electrode material, one must act upon the reaction steps with the highest normalized electrochemical sensitivities. On the other hand, experiments at different applied voltages showed that if the electroactive surface poisoning processes take place, changes in E-app should be carefully used to compare the catalytic activity of the electrodes considering the effects by surface coverages. Finally, the importance of making measurements at steady-state to avoid difficulties in the calculations of apparent activation energy is also discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900029

Never-theless, these homogeneous methodologies typically necessitate the utilization of noble metal-based (e.g., Ir, Ru, etc.) photosensitizers. In contrast, solid-state semiconductors represent an attractive alternative but remain less explored for C-C bond-forming reactions driven by visible-light irradiation. Herein, we report that photocatalytic pinacol C-C coupling of benzaldehyde to hydrobenzoin can be achieved on two-dimensional ZnIn2S4 nanosheets upon visible-light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (e.g., triethylamine). We further demonstrate that it is feasible to take advantage of both excited electrons and holes in irradiated ZnIn2S4 for C-C coupling reactions in the absence of any sacrificial reagent if benzyl alcohol utilized as the starting substrate, maximizing the energy efficiency of photocatalysis and circumventing any byproducts. In this case, industrially important benzoin and deoxybenzoin are formed as the final products. More importantly, by judiciously tuning the photocatalytic conditions, we are able to produce either benzoin or deoxybenzoin with unprecedented high selectivity. The critical species during the photocatalytic process were systematically investigated with various scavengers. Finally, such a heterogeneous photocatalytic pinacol C-C coupling strategy was applied to produce a jet fuel precursor (e.g., hydrofuroin) from biomass-derived furanics (e.g., furfural and furfural alcohol), highlighting the promise of our approach in practical applications.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900030

These structures are dynamic and provide changes in the chemical environment and redox state of transition metal centers that result in drastic changes in the catalytic behavior. Inspired by these catalytic traits, porous polymers represent a versatile platform for preparing catalysts by anchoring metals to organic functional groups. Following this inspiration, we studied the structural evolution of a series of catalysts containing atomically dispersed Cu ions grafted onto imine-linked porous organic frameworks (IPOFs) during synthesis and reaction. Cu species were found to be bound to the imine or diiminopyridine units of IPOFs and to be active for oxidation of carbon monoxide. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (S) showed that the metal centers could gradually activate oxygen and change their oxidation state. Interestingly, depending on the type of functional group responsible for binding Cu, the active sites either reach a balanced redox turnover between Cu(I) and Cu(II) states or get poisoned by CO and locked at a Cu(I) state during reaction. Furthermore, samples with agglomerated Cu species were found to be redispersed upon contact with the reaction mixture, which promoted a high initial activity not seen in the original samples. Overall, our results show that catalytic sites in porous polymers can have very dynamic structures that are highly dependent on the polymer functional groups as well as reaction conditions and show how this strategy can be used to produce active catalysts with a wide range of possible compositions and chemistries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900031

Doped carbon-based materials offer a viable means for replacing Pt, but their activity improvement still remains a great challenge. Here, configurations of N-doped carbons are first analyzed using ab initio simulations toward ORR. The results show that a certain short-range ordered structure labeled as C-N2, which comprises of two nitrogen atoms flanking carbon, is the optimal choice. The predicted configuration of C-N2 is experimentally realized by triazine-doped carbon (triNC). The triNC with C-N2 sites demonstrates high ORR activity (onset potential 0.98 V, halfwave potential 0.89 V) comparable to commercial 20% Pt/C. The highly localized and positive-charged carbon atom in the C-N2 structure facilitates the dissociation of O-2 to increase the ORR kinetics, proved by theoretical calculation. A Zn-air cathode is fabricated using the triNC ORR electrocatalyst and outperforms the cathode using Pt/C in terms of specific capacity, energy density and long-term durability. The atomic-scale approach reported here provides a good strategy to achieve active carbon-based electrocatalysts for potential and scalable use in energy conversion and storage.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900032

We considered all relevant elementary reaction steps on Co(11 (2) over bar1) step-edge and Co(0001) terrace sites as well as such important aspects as coverage-related lateral interactions, different chaingrowth mechanisms, and the migration of adsorbed species between the two surfaces in the dual-site model. CHx-CHy coupling pathways relevant to the carbide mechanism have favorable barriers in comparison to the overall barriers for the CO insertion mechanism. A comparison of reaction barriers indicates why cobalt is such a good FT catalyst: CO bond scission and chain growth compete, while termination to olefins has a slightly higher barrier. The predicted kinetic parameters correspond well with experimental kinetic data. The Co(11 (2) over bar1) model surface is highly active and selective for the FT reaction. Adding terrace Co(0001) sites in a dual-site model approach leads to a substantially higher CH4 selectivity at the expense of the C2+-hydrocarbons selectivity. The chain-growth probability decreases with increasing temperature and H-2/CO ratio, caused by faster hydrogenation of the hydrocarbon chains. The elementary reaction steps for O removal and CO dissociation significantly control the overall CO consumption rate. Chain growth occurs almost exclusively at step-edge sites, while additional CH4 stems from CH and CH3 migration from step-edge to terrace sites. Replacing CO by CO, as the reactant shifts the product distribution nearly completely to CH4, which is related to the much higher H/CO coverage ratio during CO2 hydrogenation in comparison to CO hydrogenation. These findings highlight the importance of a proper balance of CO and H surface species during the FT reaction and pinpoint step-edge sites as the locus of the FT reaction with low-reactive terrace sites near step-edge sites being the origin of unwanted CH4.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900033

However, reports on deoxygenation of longer polyols (e.g., erythritol, xylitol, and sorbitol) to monoalkenes are scarce, especially when using H-2 as reducing agent. Here we design a conceptually different catalyst system for polyol conversion to olefins, containing a selective Ru hydrogenation function (e.g., RuBr3) in an ionic liquid that dehydrates alcohols (tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, Bu4PBr). This system performs HDO of erythritol to butenes in yields up to 69%. Strikingly, overreduction to less valuable butane is effectively suppressed. We show that in situ formed CO is crucial in the formation and stabilization of the active and selective catalyst. The actual hydrogenation catalyst is identified as a Ru carbonyl bromide species, as demonstrated by FTIR and XANES. Finally, we show that this HDO also works for more economically relevant polyols: glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol, leading to propene, pentenes, and hexenes as main products, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900034

By applying electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to compare hydrated, dehydrated, and NH3-saturated catalysts before and after hydrothermal aging, as well as density functional theory calculations, it is found that hydrothermal aging induces Cu relocation, leading to stronger Cu-support interactions. This is particularly evidenced by ZCuOH conversion to Z(2)Cu, which leads to the generation of a structure with two Cu(II) cations positioned in a double six-membered ring prism. These two Cu(II) ions have a separation of similar to 3.90 angstrom as derived by EPR analysis, which agrees well with our DFT-based model. The Cu(II) cations that do not undergo such dramatic changes also appear to stay closer to framework windows as evidenced by the overall increased anisotropy during EPR measurements. In situ EPR measurements under SCR conditions demonstrate that, in comparison to the fresh catalyst, a higher percentages of Cu species stay as Cu(II) in the aged catalyst. This suggests that the reduction half-cycle of the SCR redox, i.e., Cu(II) -> Cu(I), becomes slower for the hydrothermally aged catalyst.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900035

We report that A-site engineering of La1-xSrxFe0.8Al0.2O3 oxides significantly adjusts the oxygen capacity, which nearly triples from 1.0 mmol/g (x = 0.1) to 2.7 mmol/g (x = 0.5) with CO selectivity maintaining above 94%. Characterization results show that doping of Sr at the La-site induces dynamic crystal reconstruction from perovskite to Fe-0 and LanSrFen-xAlxO3n+1 (n = 1 and 2) oxides with Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) structure, possessing good methane activation and oxygen transport property, respectively. Spontaneously growth of RP oxides around Fe-0 rapidly delivers lattice oxygen from perovskite oxide to Fe-0. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that introduction of Sr notably reduces oxygen vacancy formation energy, leading to better oxygen donating ability. The synergy between dynamic structure evolution and oxygen mobility modulation greatly improves methane-to-syngas performance, which provides meaningful guidance to design advanced catalysts with better oxygen capacity for specific catalytic transformations.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900036

However, existing chemoenzymatic systems with more than one chemical reaction and one enzymatic reaction working cooperatively are rare. Moreover, the application of oxidoreductases in cooperative chemoenzymatic reactions is limited by the necessity of using expensive and unstable redox equivalents such as nicotinamide cofactors. Here, we report a light-driven cooperative chemoenzymatic system comprised of a photoinduced electron transfer reaction (PET) and a photosensitized energy transfer reaction (PEnT) with an enzymatic reduction in one-pot to synthesize chiral building blocks of bioactive compounds. As a proof of concept, ene-reductase was directly regenerated by PET in the absence of external cofactors. Meanwhile, enzymatic reduction worked cooperatively with photocatalyst-catalyzed energy transfer that continuously replenished the reactive isomer from the less reactive one. The whole system stereoconvergently reduced E/Z mixtures of alkenes to the enantiopure products. Additionally, enantioselective enzymatic reduction worked competitively with photocatalyst-catalyzed racemic background reaction and side reactions to channel the overall electron flow to the single enantiopure product. Such a light-driven cooperative chemoenzymatic system holds great potential for asymmetric synthesis using inexpensive petroleum or biomass-derived alkenes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900037

Here we demonstrate how a combination of machine learning and first-principles calculations can be used to extract knowledge from a relatively small set of experimental data. The approach is based on combining a complex machine-learning model trained on a computational library of transition-state energies with simple linear regression models of experimental catalytic activities and selectivities from the literature. Using the combined model, we identify the key C-C bond-scission reactions involved in ethanol reforming and perform a computational screening for ethanol reforming on monolayer bimetallic catalysts with architectures TM-Pt-Pt(111) and Pt-TM-Pt(111) (TM = 3d transition metals). The model also predicts four promising catalyst compositions for future experimental studies. The approach is not limited to ethanol reforming but is of general use for the interpretation of experimental observations as well as for the computational discovery of catalytic materials.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900038

These conclusions are first validated by experimental data on MIL-100(Fe)/MIL-100(Fe,Mn) and further used as guidelines to develop a ruthenium-based MIL-100 with even better catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900039

The robust charging reversibility of the redox metal sites ensures long-term durability of the devices but remains unachieved and usually ignored. Here, we use in situ UV-vis and Raman spectroscopies to track the redox states of a nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)(2) model catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during its lifetime in strong alkaline media. We show that at 200 mAcm(-2) in the 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the reversible redox states of the catalytically active Ni sites gradually disappear when the catalyst converts into an irreversible and inactive phase. We found that after deactivation, the complete reduction of such oxidized Ni sites can not be achieved until a very negative reduction potential around 0.1 V RHE was applied owing to the structural amorphization/disordering of the layered Ni(OH)(2) catalyst. Our results suggest that the deactivated and unreduced Ni sites hardly re-hydrate/re-hydroxylate and thus obstruct the OER process. These findings provide direct evidence for elucidation of the origin of the oxygen evolution decay and contribute to a reference to extend the lifetime of 2D-layered transition-metal hydroxide catalysts by stabilizing the reversible redox metal sites.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900040

The goal of this study is to optimize the catalytic efficiency of microgels by decreasing their particle size with surfactants that are custom-made for the respective prepolymerization mixture. The effectiveness of the approach is examined by evaluating the catalytic efficiency of the resulting microgels in comparison to their counterparts made in the presence of ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution. Spherical particles with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value dependent mean hydrodynamic diameters between 99 and 200 nm are obtained. Addition of Cu(II) ions and selected other transition metal ions activated the dormant catalysts for cleavage of glycosidic bonds in 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer at pH 7.00 and 37 degrees C using a fluorescent model substrate. The highest proficiency for the catalytic hydrolysis was observed for Cu(II)-containing microgels (K-cat/K-M x K-non = 870 000) with the lowest diameter indicating an almost twofold better stabilization of the transition state compared to a microgel prepared in the presence of ionic SDS solution. The study establishes a correlation of the HLB value of the nonionic surfactant blend used during material synthesis to the particle size and catalytic performance of the resulting microgels.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900041

Zeotypes are a class of microporous oxides whose lattices are substituted with metal heteroatoms, which serve as primary binding sites to catalyze a variety of chemical transformations including reductions, oxidations, and condensations. Research efforts continue to develop more complete mechanistic descriptions of catalytic behavior, requiring increasingly accurate descriptions of all moieties that comprise active centers. Framework metal heteroatoms adopt various local configurations that are difficult to control synthetically and are susceptible to restructuring during reaction. These binding sites contain structural and catalytic diversity even when they are located in the nominally simplest zeotype frameworks, as is typically the case for "model" heterogeneous catalyst materials of purportedly well-defined structure. Secondary environments are well-documented to influence catalysis via shape selectivity and confinement effects, yet their polarity, as defined by the oxide framework and any polar binding sites it contains (e.g., heteroatoms, hydroxyl groups), also influences the structures and Gibbs free energies of intermediates and transition states, as well as coadsorbed intraporous molecules, leading to further catalytic diversity. These three aspects that describe active centers at and beyond their binding sites must be accounted for in quantitative descriptions of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors that dictate catalysis over metal-containing zeotypes. Advances in describing the structural and catalytic diversity of these materials have required harnessing state of the art computational, spectroscopic, material synthesis, and chemical characterization methods. Herein, we outline opportunities to leverage experiment and theory to interrogate these aspects of active centers with increasing fidelity, to further advance molecular descriptions of catalysis over metal-containing zeotypes and broaden their range of catalytic behavior.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900043

Highly enantioselective construction of such quaternary carbon centers poses a singular challenge due to the steric repulsion between the four different carbon substituents. Herein, we report a novel strategy to control the enantioselective construction of chiral aquaternary alpha-ldehydes from racemic alpha-branched aldehydes. Distinct from the established chiral alpha-quaternary aldehyde synthesis, this project employed a chiral pi-allyl-Pd complex neighboring the enolate to determine both the enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The synthetic utility of the products has been highlighted by a series of derivatizations, and the potential of this method has been extended to the synthesis of chiral alpha-quaternary ketones. Furthermore, this reaction exemplifies the themes of step and atom economy, in addition to the principles of diversity-oriented synthesis.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900044

It is desirable to develop catalysts that perform well at low temperature and pressure (250-400 degrees C, <2 MPa). The main challenge of low-temperature NH3 synthesis is the dissociation of the extremely stable N N triple bond. Herein, we report the design of homogeneous single-atom Ru centers on an H-ZMS-5 (HZ) support with the Ru atoms individually anchored in the micropores of HZ, effectively boosting NH3 synthesis under mild conditions via an associative pathway. Synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and in situ DRIFTS analyses show that =N- groups are the primary intermediates, and DFT calculations further show that, unlike Ru nanoclusters, the cooperation of a single Ru atom and hydrogen species in HZ leads to N-2 hydrogenation rather than direct N-2 dissociation, and the indirect N-N bond dissociation occurs much more easily via the formation of the NHNH3* intermediate; the energy barrier for breaking the N-N bond keeps falling from 2.90 eV for *N-2 to 0.04 eV for *NHNH3, showing that N-2 hydrogenation is an effective way for sharp weakening of N-N bonds. Moreover, the rate-determining step is shifted from the dissociation of the N N triple bond to the formation of *N2H2. As a consequence, the single-atom 0.2 wt % Ru/H-ZSM-5 catalyst shows the highest NH3 synthesis rate per gram of Ru (1.26 mol(NH3) gRu(-1) h(-1) at 300 degrees C and 1 MPa) among the Ru-based catalysts ever reported.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900045

The HppE-catalyzed 1,2-phosphono-migration of (R)-1-HPP, which involves the pro-R hydrogen abstraction from C2, was proposed to proceed via the formation of a C2 carbocation intermediate. Here, we show that such an intermediate does not transpire during the reaction. The reorientation of the singly occupied orbital at the C2-radical center, through out-of-plane torsion of the P-C1-C2-C3 dihedral angle, triggers the phosphono-migration and precludes the attack of the Fe-bound OH on the C2 radical (hydroxylation) as well as the C2-O coupling (epoxidation). For the substrate (1R)-1-hydroxyl-2-aminopropyl phosphonate, the lone-pair electrons on the amino group enable a fast proton-coupled electron transfer process, wherein the proton transfer from the amino group to phosphonate is coupled to the electron transfer from the C2 radical to the iron center, leading to a C2-iminium cation rather than the phosphono-migration. Finally, the C2 iminium intermediate is converted to a ketone product and NH3. These results demonstrate that the alpha-heteroatom substituent is vital for the generation of the cationic species, as well as the selectivity control in the HppE-catalyzed reactions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900047

Semilocal exchange correlation functionals are known to provide an incorrect adsorption site and overestimated adsorption energy for CO on Pt. We develop a simple first-principles correction for the adsorption energy of CO on Pt(111) and Pt(100) using the bond length of adsorbed CO as a descriptor. The energy correction, which increases in the order top < bridge < hollow site, is used to derive the surface stability diagram for CO adsorbed on 111 and 100 facets of Pt showing the thermodynamically stable CO configurations on the surface as a function of temperature and pressure. High coverage (theta > 0.5) configurations of CO on Pt(111) lead to the formation of superimposed hexagonal/quasi-hexagonal lattice of CO on the hexagonal Pt(111) layer from a systematic exploration of such structures. Non-hexagonal structures seen in vacuum and low temperature conditions, (root 3 x 3)rect-4CO and c(root 3 x 7)rect-SCO, are however only 5 meV/angstrom(2) less stable than the hexagonal lattice at a similar coverage. For Pt(100) at theta >= 0.75, the CO molecules adopt a one-dimensional coincidence lattice and we observe the formation of (n x 2) unit cells (n = 4, 6, 8) with (2n - 2) CO molecules in each cell on top/quasi-top and bridge/quasi-bridge positions creating a skewed hexagonal lattice to reduce CO-CO repulsion with increasing coverage. The computational results agree with the available experimental observations for Pt(111) and Pt(100). The integrated theoretical simulation and experimental observation provide structural data for the study of catalytic reactivity on Pt surfaces in reactions involving high CO pressures and suggest an approach for understanding the structure of CO molecules on other metal catalyst surfaces during the catalytic reactions involving a high pressure of CO.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900048

Strict legislation limits the sulfur content in fuels to ultralow levels, only achieved through harsh chemical methods that produce massive amounts of CO 2 . Bio-desulfurization represents a more environmentally friendly alternative, with the bacteria Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 eliminating sulfur from the most chemically recalcitrant organosulfur compounds through a set of reactions performed by four enzymes (DszA-D). Despite its potential, bio-desulfurization is still too slow for direct use in refineries. As such, there is an urgent need to develop faster enzymes for the 4S pathway. To help in this endeavor, we determine here the reaction mechanism of the rate-limiting enzyme DszB with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods and clarify the fine molecular requisites for efficient catalysis. The first and rate-limiting step of the reaction is the protonation of 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate by Cys27 with an activation barrier of 25.3 kcal.mol(-1) and follows an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, releasing the SO2 group and forming the Cys27 thiolate and the hydroxybiphenyl product. Cys27 and SO2 then react with a water molecule, completing the reactional cycle, and release sulfur as HSO3-. The rate-limiting step of the reaction was replicated for 21 different conformations of DszB, enabling the clear identification and quantification of the most relevant active-site preorganization requisites for the reaction to occur through low barriers. Finally, we rationally identified the residues that can be mutated to design much more efficient, oil refinery-competent DszB variants.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900049

In acid-catalyzed biomass conversions, water is a key reagent/byproduct that can induce leaching/poisoning of catalyst's acid species, a major problem toward catalyst recyclability and product purification. Thus, developing efficient water-tolerant solid acid catalysts is vital for viable biomass valorization. TiO2 is considered to be a promising water-tolerant solid acid catalyst for biomass conversions because of the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4+ sites, which are robust and less prone to leaching in the aqueous medium. Besides, the synergistic combination of TiO2 with redox metals (Ru, Pd, Ni, Cu, etc.) provides abundant bifunctional acid-redox sites, which exhibit a favorable catalytic role in the deoxygenation of biomass molecules to practically useful hydrocarbons. Therefore, this review provides an overview of recent progress toward TiO2-based water-tolerant acid catalysis for biomass conversion, with a focus on hydrothermal stability of TiO2, its acidity, and catalysts' synthesis methods. Various biomass conversions over TiO2-based catalysts, where water-tolerant acid sites or acid-redox dual sites show a significant catalytic effect, were discussed. Structure-activity relationships based on water-tolerant Lewis acidity of TiO2 were emphasized. We believe that this review will provide valuable information for developing efficient water-tolerant solid acid catalysts not only for biomass valorization but also for other challenging reactions in the aqueous medium.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900050

Two proposed mechanisms, dearomatization of pyridine catalyzed by cooperation of two copper(I) centers and by one copper(I), are calculated and analyzed. The results indicate that one copper(I) center is capable of catalyzing the dearomatization reaction. To achieve the dearomatization on one copper(I) center, the Cu-H addition "product" (derived from styrene insertion into Cu-H) undergoes 1,3-and 1,5-Cu migration on a benzylic ligand, facilitating the 1,2- and 1,4-dearomatization of pyridine. In the two metal-center mechanism, significant sterically repulsive interactions among the substituents on the ligands between the two metal fragments hindered the dearomatization process. The origin of selectivity between 1,2- and 1,4-dearomatization of pyridine has also been discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900051

In the first step, the Cu-catalyzed cyclopropanation of branched dienes generates vinylcyclopropanes in high yields, regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, albeit in modest cis/trans diastereoselectivity. The stereoconvergent nature of the subsequent Rh-catalyzed [5 + 2] cycloaddition with alkynes overrides this apparent limitation and affords preferentially one 7-membered ring out of the 8 or 16 possible stereoisomers that can be theoretically generated. The final regioselectivity and enantioselectivity are high in the majority of cases .

Nevertheless, choosing the appropriate experimental conditions and the use of CPI coupled with a simplified kinetic model allowed us to extract the lifetime of the species involved in substrate oxidation. These figures are usually elusive, even though there is a wide collection of hypotheses, guesses, and speculations in the literature. From our analysis, we defined a surface photocatalytic activity index The latter consists of the ratio between the surface-defined kinetic constant for substrate oxidation and surface recombination and is independent of other experimental conditions, such as irradiance and catalyst concentration.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900054

We present a mechanistic study of EDR over Rh catalyst based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis. Our results show that both the initial decomposition of C2H2OH and the later C-O bond formation are crucial steps on the reaction free energy landscape. The microkinetic model suggests that the alpha-dehydrogenation of ethanol is the rate-determining step, and the calculated reaction rate (r(H2)) is 8.23 x 10(3) s(-1). Moreover, factors behind catalyst deactivation were investigated and potential solutions were explored from both theoretical and experimental aspects. The results indicate that additional H-2 could potentially mitigate catalyst deactivation by methanation of coke deposited on the catalyst. These computational and experimental efforts further the understanding of the complicated catalytic process and inspire the rational design of EDR catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900055

Therefore, an accurate location of single atoms is essential for understanding the reaction mechanism and design of SACs anchored at 2D layered materials. However, the preparation of SACs with a precise location remains a great challenge. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation, characterization, and catalytic performance of SACs, focusing on single atoms anchored at 2D layered materials beyond graphene. These 2D materials include transitional metal dichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, and MXenes. Importantly, the topic of impurities is discussed because these can be present at an even higher percentage than the single atoms at 2D layered materials. A variety of electrochemical energy applications are discussed in which SACs have a crucial role, including water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. Finally, this review provides the latest applications and developments perspective of single metal atoms on 2D surfaces, which offers a unique opportunity to tune active sites and optimize the activity, selectivity, and stability of electrocatalysts.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900056

In this work, we demonstrate that isoprene can be efficiently produced via a hybrid bio/thermochemical process, combining the efficient fermentation of cellulosic sugars to mevalonolactone (MVL) with the acid-catalyzed MVL decarboxylation to isoprene. We report herein the thermochemical conversion of MVL to isoprene over inexpensive amorphous SiO2/Al2O3. A detailed investigation into the reaction conditions and the Si/AI ratio shows that isoprene formation is maximized over high-SiO2-content samples at mild temperatures (225-250 degrees C) that prevent its secondary oligomerization to alkylated aromatics and cyclic olefins. The highest isoprene yield is attained over SiO2/Al2O3 with 90 wt % SiO2 at 250 degrees C and 1.4 h(-1), corresponding to similar to 60% of the theoretical maximum. Acidity-performance correlations reveal the key role of Bronsted acidity in the reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900057

Stoichiometric organometallic studies reveal that R-F-S bond-forming reductive elimination is a challenging step in the catalytic cycle. This led to the identification of diphenylphosphinoferrocene as the optimal ligand for this transformation. Ultimately, this method was applied to the construction of diverse fluoroalkyl thioethers (RFSR), with R = both aryl and alkyl.									17	0	0	0	5	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000029	34306801

This substitution was risky as the reaction mechanism is thought to involve C-C bond formation via addition of alkyl carbon radicals to arenes. Such intermediates are also susceptible to C-O bond formation via O-2 addition. Control of absolute stereochemistry under aerobic conditions was also uncertain.

Nickel complexes serve as effective catalysts owing to their tendency to undergo facile oxidative addition and slow beta-hydride elimination, and their capability to access both two-electron and radical pathways. Two-component alkene functionalization reactions have achieved high chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivities by tethering one of the coupling partners to the alkene substrate. Three-component reactions, however, often incorporate directing groups to control the selectivity. Only a few examples of directing-group-free difunctionalizations of unactivated alkenes have been reported. Therefore, great opportunities exist for the development of three-component difunctionalization reactions stereoselectivities.									47	2	0	0	7	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000049	33732540

Since PALs and AEPs share essentially similar overall structures, we surmised that the S2 and S1' substrate-binding pockets immediately flanking the catalytic Si site constitute the major ligase activity determinants (LADs) that control the catalytic directionality of these enzymes. Here, we report the successful conversion of butelase-2 into butelase-1-like ligases based on the LAD hypothesis. We prepared 23 LAD mutants by mutating residues of the S2 pocket (LAD 1) and/or the S1' pocket (LAD2) of butelase-2 into homologous residues in PALs. These LAD mutants markedly diminished protease activity and increased ligase activity. In contrast, substituting 12 non-LAD residues to the corresponding residues in butelase-1 did not change their protease profiles. At physiological pH, mutations targeting both LADs resulted in shifting the catalytic directionality from 95% hydrolysis to >95% peptide ligation. This results in the engineering of efficient recombinant peptide ligases that were demonstrated to be useful for macrocyclization and site-specific labeling of bioactive peptides and proteins. Five high-resolution crystal structures of butelase-2 and its engineered mutants reveal subtle changes proximal to the catalytic Si site that account for the reversal in enzymatic activity. Computational simulations of enzyme-substrate complexes suggest how the S-acyl intermediate is positioned at the S2 site and the substrate orientated, controlling accessibility of either water or incoming nucleophiles from the prime-side (S1' site) of the catalytic center. Together, these features determine the catalytic directionality between hydrolysis and ligation in AEPs and PALs. Overall, this work validates the LAD hypothesis as a central guide for making peptide ligases from their corresponding widely available protease counterparts, to produce precision tools for exquisite site-specific conjugation and the biomanufacturing of biologics.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000072

However, creating an enzyme de novo is still in its infancy, so far yielding enzymes of modest catalytic efficiency. In this study, a system of artificial retro-aldolase enzymes found to have chemistry coupled to protein dynamics was examined. The original design was created computationally, and this protein was then subjected to directed evolution to improve the initial low catalytic efficiency. We found that this re-engineering of the enzyme resulted in rapid density fluctuations throughout the enzyme being reshaped via alterations in the hydrogen bonding network. This work also led to the discovery of a second important motion which aids in the release of an intermediate product.

In this work, we provide mechanistic insight into the framework methylation within H-ZSM-5 at high methanol loadings and varying acid site densities by means of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics simulations show that stable methanol clusters form in the zeolite pores, and these clusters commonly deprotonate the active site; however, the cluster size is dependent on the temperature and acid site density. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations give evidence that the barrier for methanol conversion is significantly affected by the neighborhood of an additional acid site, suggesting that cooperative effects influence methanol clustering and reactivity. The insights obtained are important steps in optimizing the catalyst and engineering the induction period of the methanol-to-hydrocarbon process.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000080	32923027

However, neither the location of Mg2+ in the structure of TrmD nor its role in the catalytic mechanism is known. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identify a plausible Me binding pocket within the active site of the enzyme, wherein the ion is coordinated by two aspartates and a glutamate. In this position, Mg2+ additionally interacts with the carboxylate of a methyl donor cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The computational results are validated by experimental mutation studies, which demonstrate the importance of the Mg2+-binding residues for the catalytic activity. The presence of Mg2+ in the binding pocket induces SAM to adopt a unique bent shape required for the methyl transfer activity and causes a structural reorganization of the active site. Quantum mechanical calculations show that the methyl transfer is energetically feasible only when Mg2+ is bound in the position revealed by the MD simulations, demonstrating that its function is to align the active site residues within the topological knot-fold in a geometry optimal for catalysis. The obtained insights provide the opportunity for developing a strategy of antibacterial drug discovery based on targeting of Mg2+-binding to TrmD.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000004	32904895

This work demonstrates an efficient targeted activation to C-OH, C-O-C, or C=C by engineering the structure of catalytic Pt sites, affording 2-methylfuran (2-MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), or 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PeD) as product in the hydroconversion of furfuryl alcohol. The catalytic Pt sites have been engineered as atomic Pt, coordination unsaturated Pt-Pt in atom-thick dispersion, or coordination unsaturated 3D Pt-Pt by tailoring the Pt dispersion (single atom, 2D cluster, or 3D cluster) on Mg and Al-containing layered double oxide (Mg(Al)O) support. The selective activation of C-OH, C-O-C, or C=C has been traced with the FT-IR spectra recorded surface reaction. On atomic Pt, C-O-H is easily activated, with the assistance of Mg(Al)O support, with O-terminal adsorption without affecting furan C-O and C=C. However, C=C in the furan ring is easier to be activated on coordination-unsaturated Pt-Pt in atom-thick dispersion, resulting in a step-by-step hydrogenation to generate THFA. On coordination-unsaturated 3D Pt-Pt, the hydrogenolysis of furan ring is favored, resulting in the cleavage of furan C-O to produce 1,2-PeD. Also, the Mg(Al)O supports derived from Mg and Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) here also play a key role in promoting the selectivity to 1,2-PeD by providing basic sites.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000001

This method allows the rapid synthesis of chiral benzyl alcohols in high yields and stereocontrol, despite its nontemplated nature. In a cascade activation consisting of an initial irradiation-induced radical C-H-bromination and a consecutive enantioconvergent hydroxylation, the iodoarene catalyst has a dual role. It initiates the radical bromination in its oxidized state through an in-situ-formed bromoiodane and in the second, Cu-catalyzed step, it acts as a chiral ligand. This work demonstrates the ability of a chiral aryl iodide catalyst acting both as an oxidant and as a chiral ligand in a highly enantioselective C-H-activating transformation. Furthermore, this concept presents an enantioconvergent hydroxylation with high selectivity using a synthetic catalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000002		
J	Moradzaman, Mozhgan; Mul, Guido								Infrared Analysis of Interfacial Phenomena during Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 over Polycrystalline Copper Electrodes								ACS CATALYSIS				10	15			8049	8057		10.1021/acscatal.0c02130				AUG 7 2020	2020	Using attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy and similar to 10 nm thick, sputtered Cu-films on single bounce Si-ATR-crystals, we have analyzed the electrochemical conversion of CO2 in 0.1 M NaOH/D2O solutions. By using cyclic voltammetry, transitions in the composition of dissolved and surface-adsorbed species could be identified. At a highly negative potential [more negative than -1.2 V (vs RHE)], the formation of OD- and D-2 is dominant, resulting in a relatively high concentration of dissolved carbonate, with a maximum IR intensity at , similar to 1410 cm(-1). When the potential is less negative than -1.2 V, spectroscopically resolved interconversion of carbonate (CO32-) to bicarbonate (D)CO(3)(- )is evident, explained by a decrease in the local pH. Furthermore, adsorbed carbonate can now be distinguished from dissolved carbonate due to the strongly potential-dependent peak position of adsorbed carbonate ranging from similar to 1510 to 1570 cm(-1). In the potential range of -1.2 to -0.5 V (vs RHE), using D2O, the recently proposed CO2-dimerradical-anion was observed, adsorbed on the polycrystalline copper film. We also assign a previously unresolved band at similar to 1610 cm(-1) to this species. The dimer disproportionates to adsorbed CO and CO32-, the latter being converted to bicarbonate by proton addition. Adsorbed CO is sensitive to a Stark shift, that is, a shift as a function of applied potential. Eventually, CO disappears, and the infrared signature of (dissolved) formate at similar to 1590 cm(-1) appears at similar to -0.5 V. We discuss the spectra and chemistry in detail, based on the reference spectra of carbonate, bicarbonate, and formate and using (CO2)-C-13 to substantiate the formation of the dimer intermediate. The results are discussed and compared to recent literature on infrared analysis of electrochemical reduction of CO2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000003

Herein we disclose an asymmetric allylation of 3-hydroxyisoben-zofuran-1(3H)-ones with boron allylation reagents to construct chiral phthalide derivatives. The simple Bi(OAc)(3)/chiral phosphoric acid catalytic system proves to be efficient in this method, delivering the desired chiral 3-allylisobenzofuran-1(3H)-ones in good yields (up to 99%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99.5:0.5 e.r.) under mild conditions. The large-scale reaction and diverse transformations of products to various scaffolds with potential biological activities render it more attractive.

The present reaction model involves 25 different species and a total of 86 elementary processes, including adsorptions, desorptions, surface chemical steps, and diffusions. The reaction network accounts for three different mechanisms for the reverse water-gas shift reaction and three different mechanisms for methanation. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the reverse water-gas shift reaction dominates the CO2 hydrogenation on Ni(111) with no evidence of methane formation. The reaction proceeds mainly through the redox route, with the carboxyl pathway also being active but to a lesser extent. Methane production is hindered by the H + CO -> HCO endothermicity and the prohibitive energy barrier for CO dissociation, implying CO desorption rather than evolution through the Sabatier reaction. A detailed comparison to earlier theoretical studies supporting the methanation reaction shows that some unreliable assumptions along with limited theoretical approaches biased the former conclusion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000006

This tries to ensure efficient and sustainable base chemical production, while also safeguarding human health and the environment. To this end, the development of novel, nontoxic, and effective catalytic systems that are capable of driving value-added chemical transformations in environmentally benign solvents (e.g., water) is highly desirable. Moreover, these new catalysts need to be metal-free, easy-to-prepare, and potentially recyclable. Carbon dots, which are relatively new carbon-based nanoparticles, fulfill all these requirements because of their outstanding physicochemical features and thus have emerged as promising nanocatalytic platforms. This Perspective highlights the recent advances in synthesis of carbon dots and their applications in organic catalysis and photocatalysis, with particular attention to green nonmetal-doped systems. Finally, forward-looking opportunities within this field are mentioned here.									19	2	0	0	5	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000007

The kinetic study revealed that a water content in OME1 as low as 0.21 wt % can significantly hamper the reaction rate. The apparent activation energy increased with the water ATR-IR concentration, but the frequency factor was more severely affected and decreased by an order of magnitude when the water concentration was doubled. With increasing water content, the chain growth mechanism shifted from competition between the direct insertion of TRI and the dissociation of TRI with formaldehyde incorporation, to reaction of TRI with water to form methylene glycol units which were inserted in the OME chain. The competition between water and the reactants for binding to the active sites of the zeolite was studied by means of modulated excitation attenuated total reflection infrared (ME-ATRIR) spectroscopy experiments. It demonstrated a competition for silanol sites and Bronsted acid sites (BAS) according to the binding affinity order OME1 > H2O > TRI. This trend was confirmed by a DFT study of the interaction of OME1, TRI, and H2O with BAS. Combined together, these results indicated that the presence of water inhibited the adsorption of TRI on the binding sites, which prevented OME growth. Hence, even very low levels of water must be controlled for an efficient catalytic process.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000008

Cyclic voltammetry at different concentrations of formic acid and different scan rates and pulsed voltammetry were used to obtain a deeper insight into the effect of formate coverage on the rate of the direct pathway. Pulsed voltammetry also provided information on the effect of the concentration of formic acid on the rate of the formation of adsorbed CO on Pt(100). At low to medium coverage, increasing formate coverage increases the rate of its direct oxidation, suggesting that decreasing the distance between neighboring bidentate-adsorbed formate favors its interconversion to and/or stabilizes monodentate formate (the reactive species). However, increasing the formate coverage beyond approximately 50% results in a decrease of the rate of the direct oxidation, probably because bidentate formate is too closely packed for its conversion to monodentate formate to be possible. Cyclic voltammetry at very high scan rates reveals the presence of an order- disorder phase transition within the bidentate formate adlayer on Pt(111) when the coverage approaches saturation. The dependence of the potential of the maximum rate of dehydration to adsorbed CO, and of the rate at the maximum, on the concentration of formic acid is in good agreement with predictions made for a mechanism, in which adsorbed CO is formed through the adsorption of formate followed by its reduction to adsorbed CO, thus confirming that monodentate-adsorbed formate is the last intermediate common to both the direct and indirect pathways.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000009

According to X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements, it was revealed that, during the CH4 combustion, the Pd nanoparticles existed on the Al2O3 support as a PdO phase, while the crystallinity of PdO depended on the Pd particle size. On the basis of X-ray diffraction XRD), amorphous PdO particles with a size of <7 nm exhibited low activity for CH4 combustion. In contrast, as the Pd particle size increased, larger crystalline PdO particles (>7 nm) were formed, which were highly active for CH4 combustion. Comparing the effects of the different Al(2)O(3 )crystalline phases, Pd/alpha-Al2O3 was proved to be more resistant to deactivation by H2O than Pd/gamma-Al(2)O(3 )and Pd/theta-Al2O3. Moreover, according to H2O temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and infrared (IR) measurements, since alpha-Al2O3 was relatively hydrophobic compared to gamma-Al2O3 and theta-Al2O3, a faster and reversible adsorption/desorption of OH/H2O species was achieved, while the H2O poisoning on PdO species in the vicinity was limited.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000012

It is a significant research challenge to find catalysts that can withstand water while delivering rates comparable to the dry PdO phase. Therefore, an in situ water sorption strategy could be advantageous in maintaining high rates for the reaction. Here, we investigate water sorbents that are used to remove the water produced by the reaction, which significantly enhances the activity of a Pd/CeO2 catalyst for methane combustion. The results reveal that the addition of zeolites or alumina to the Pd catalyst can transiently reduce the water concentration in the reactor and thus lead to increased catalytic rates. However, due to the limited number of sorption sites, hydroxylation of the PdO phase takes place rapidly, causing the catalyst to quickly exhibit the same activity as without the sorbent after a transient state. However, by using a stronger sorbent such as CaO mixed with the catalyst, it is possible to obtain higher catalytic activity that is maintained for longer periods of time. This latter system exhibits a 6-fold improvement in transient conversion of methane compared to that of the control catalyst. Meanwhile, long-term stability tests show catalytic activity higher than that without sorbent for extended periods of time. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that the number of adsorptive sites and the water sorption energy on the sorbents both influenced the water sorption efficiency. Although the sorbent needs to be regenerated, we envision this strategy being useful in conditions where regeneration can be performed without disruption of the catalytic performance. Overall, this work opens an avenue for promoting the methane combustion activity of catalysts by in situ water sorption.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000013

The reactions showed good functional group compatibility, proceeded well under mild conditions, and provided biaryls in yields of up to 96%. A wide range of useful functional groups, such as fluoro, chloro, ether, hydroxyl, amide, cyano, keto, trimethylsilyl (TMS), and ester were tolerated under the reaction conditions; however, the use of phenylboronic anhydride and arylboronic acid pinacol esters generally would lead low yields. Good regioselectivity for the electron-poor phenyl group was achieved when unsymmetrical diphenyl sulfoxides were used. The protocol is applicable at the gram scale even with half the amount of catalyst. Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, indicating that the reaction occurred through oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination to provide the final coupling product.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000014		
J	Biswas, Saborni; Kurtz, Donald M., Jr.; Montoya, Samuel R.; Hendrich, Michael P.; Bominaar, Emile L.								The Catalytic Role of a Conserved Tyrosine in Nitric Oxide-Reducing Non-heme Diiron Enzymes								ACS CATALYSIS				10	15			8177	8186		10.1021/acscatal.0c01884				AUG 7 2020	2020	Recent studies have identified several key intermediates of the nitric oxide reductase (NOR) cycle of flavodiiron proteins (FDPs). These intermediates include, sequentially, a mu-hydroxo diferrous species, a mono-NO intermediate, a di-NO intermediate (FDPdiNO), and a bis-mu-hydroxo diferric species. This paper focuses on the reaction path connecting the last two intermediates on which the nitrous oxide product is released. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, a reaction sequence is proposed in which the enzyme passes through an intermediate with a bridging hyponitrite ligand, which accepts a proton, initiating a rate-determining ligand rotation from an N/N-to an N/O-coordinated conformation. This rotation is facilitated by a second-sphere tyrosine residue, which provides a transient hydrogen bond to one of the nitrogen atoms of the substrate near the transition state. The role of the tyrosine residue in the NOR activity has been tested by steady-state kinetics and rapid freeze-quench (RFQ) studies of the Y197F variant of the FDP from T. maritima in which the hydrogen bonding interaction is absent. The Y197F variant displayed little or no steady-state NOR activity in support of the importance of Y197. The RFQ samples, monitored by Mossbauer spectroscopy, showed that Y197F follows the same reaction path as a wild-type FDP up to and including the formation of FDPdiNO but diverges subsequently with the variant forming an inactive mono-NO species. The RFQ results demonstrate that Y197 enables the postFDP(diNO) section of the reaction cycle in the wild-type FDP to proceed to N2O. The proposed refinement of the reaction mechanism provides an explanation for the lack of NOR activity of the variant Y197F of T. maritima and of other di-NO binding diiron enzymes and model compounds with active site structures like those of FDPs. The reported reductions of NO to N2O catalyzed by synthetic diiron complexes proceed only with the support of radiation, additional electrons, or an electron-rich ligand environment. However, higher potential diiron sites like those of FDPs require hydrogen bonding to second-sphere residues to turn over NO to N2O.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000015

This work elucidated the effect of different pretreatments on molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) to understand how surface reactivity is controlled by the surface oxidation state. The catalyst was pretreated in oxidative, inert, and reducing environments. The inert and reducing pretreatments created oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface that acted as active sites for the adsorption of oxygenated molecules, with the reducing pretreatment yielding a higher density of these active sites. Exposing the catalyst to an alcoholic solvent such as methanol also led to a partial reduction similar to the inert pretreatment. After pretreatment, the catalyst was exposed to ethanol, acetaldehyde, and crotonaldehyde with subsequent characterization by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Density functional theory (DFT) was also used to determine adsorption configurations and energies of ethanol, acetaldehyde, and crotonaldehyde. Reduced surfaces were shown to have a stronger affinity for carbonyls, leading to a higher activity for the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde and ethanol to C-4 molecules. Catalysts pretreated in an oxidative environment were completely inactive toward chemisorption and reaction of acetaldehyde.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000016

It is also a heavily used chemical in various industrial and agricultural applications, making it a toxic water pollutant worldwide. Catalytic reduction of ClO3- into Cl- by H-2 is of great interest to both emission control and water purification, but platinum group metal catalysts are either sluggish or severely inhibited by halide anions. Here, we report on the facile preparation, robust performance, and mechanistic investigation of a MoOx-Pd/C catalyst for aqueous ClO(3)(- )reduction. Under 1 atm H-2 and room temperature, the Na2MoO4 precursor is rapidly immobilized from aqueous solution onto Pd/C as a mixture of low-valent Mo oxides. The catalyst enables complete reduction of ClO3- in a wide concentration range (e.g., 1 mu M to 1 M) into Cl-. The addition of Mo to Pd/C not only enhances the catalytic activity by >55-fold, but also provides strong resistance to concentrated salts. To probe the reaction mechanisms, we conducted a series of kinetic measurements, microscopic and X-ray spectroscopic characterizations, sorption experiments, tests with other oxyanion substrates, and a comparative study using dissolved Mo species. The catalytic sites are the reduced MoOx species (primarily Mo-IV), showing selective and proton-assisted reactivity with ClO3-. This work demonstrates a great promise of using relatively abundant metals to expand the functionality of hydrogenation catalysts for environmental and energy applications.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000017

This is almost a dogma in the development of C-H activation reactions. Here we report a strategy to change this dogma, as we have found that a Pd-catalyzed, ligand-enabled remote gamma-alkylation of saturated aliphatic carboxamides can be realized in the presence of more accessible beta-C-H bonds by using strained bicyclic alkenes as the coupling partners. Density functional theory calculations and experiments suggested that the realization of the change in the regiodetermining step from commonly encountered irreversible C-H activations, which are reversible here, to an unexpected Pd migration process, which is regiodetermining. This is a new strategy to achieve gamma-C-H activation, compared with the previous strategy, making gamma-C-H activation both the turnover- and regiodetermining step.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000018

Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis with Liquid and Vapor Phase Tellurium								ACS CATALYSIS				10	15			8223	8230		10.1021/acscatal.0c00805				AUG 7 2020	2020	Methane pyrolysis transforms CH4 into hydrogen and solid carbon without a CO2 byproduct. Using a high-temperature liquid catalyst in a bubble column reactor, deactivation from coking is avoided and the solid carbon removed. As an element with high electron affinity, liquid tellurium is an active methane pyrolysis catalyst with an apparent activation energy of 166 kJ/mol. At the reaction temperature of approximately 1000 degrees C, Te has a high vapor pressure and the vapor is also found to be a catalyst with an apparent activation energy of 178 kJ/mol. Contrary to results obtained for other molten alloy catalysts, dissolving Ni in molten tellurium lowers the pyrolysis activity. Quantum mechanical calculations were performed with accurate methods for the gas-phase reaction, and with ab initio, constant-temperature, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with energies computed using density functional theory for the liquid phase.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000019

This reaction features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scopes, delivering a wide range of highly functionalized chiral amine derivatives. Mechanistic studies suggest that chiral lithium phosphate can serve as a pocket to accelerate the aggregation of enamide and RAE through hydrogen-bonding and coordination interaction, enabling the formation of a charge-transfer complex (CTC). Either enamide or CTC can be excited by direct irradiation or Ru(II)-mediated photosensitization to furnish chiral iminium intermediates for the asymmetric Friedel-Crafts reaction of indole.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000022

Cp* iridium Precatalysts for Selective C-H Oxidation via Direct Oxygen Insertion: A Joint Experimental/Computational Study. ACS Catal. 2012, 2, 208 218), in the present study, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations on another kind of an Ir-oxo complex, namely, [Ir-v(eta(5)-C5H5){bpy(COOH)(2)}(O)](2+) or OC, where bpy(COOH)(2) is 2,2'-bipyridine-4,4' dicarboxylic acid, to assess its ability to hydroxylate methane to methanol. OC is formed by light-induced oxidation of the Ir-H2O complex to generate electricity. By hydroxylating methane to methanol and inserting H2O, OC can regenerate the Ir-H2O complex and thus create a catalytic loop similar to a fuel cell. Herein, by utilizing intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) analysis, we show detailed mechanisms of how OC efficiently cleaves the strong C-H bond of methane to form methanol in three possible spin states, namely, the triplet, open-shell singlet, and closed-shell singlet states. In the triplet state, the C-H bond cleavage proceeds with an activation energy of only 11.3 kcal/mol via a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, where an intermediate species involving (CH3)-C-center dot and Ir-OH center dot is formed in the same spin state, although a spin change to the open-shell singlet state is likely to occur. A subsequent HO-CH3 recombination occurs without a barrier through direct radical coupling in the open-shell singlet state. In contrast, the C-H bond cleavage in the closed-shell singlet state occurs via a hydride transfer (or oxygen insertion) mechanism, where methanol is directly formed without any intermediate states. Although this reaction mechanism requires a lower C-H activation energy (5.6 kcal/mol), OC in the closed-shell singlet state is less stable by 11.9 kcal/mol than that in the triplet state. These results provide a theoretical prediction of an alternative promising catalyst for the direct conversion of methane to methanol and the methane fuel cell.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000023

In suitable materials, these changes favor the cyclic production of synthesis gas. Advanced study of these properties is of prime importance when strengthening the material selection criteria for thermochemical applications. Considering this, we investigate the redox behavior of LaxSr1-xMnO3 (LSM) perovskite oxide systems during dry and steam chemical looping reforming of methane. The durability and structural stability are studied for cyclic regeneration to the parent perovskite structure. It is observed that lanthanum addition suppresses the LSM structural disintegration during the reduction reaction and promotes its regeneration upon reoxidation. High syngas yields of up to 2.7 mmol g(-1) are produced with 25% lanthanum content during 30 consecutive cycles of dry reforming of methane. H-2 purity is also increased by up to 18% in lanthanum-rich LSM structures when compared to pure SrMn0 3 with similar to 74% H-2 purity. It is found that despite structural disintegration, manganese plays an active role in redox activities and its oxidation state is greatly influenced by lanthanum concentration and oxidation medium. We think that this study will supplement the in-depth investigation of the material's physiochemical properties before and after the redox reactions prior to selection of a suitable oxygen carrier/catalyst.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000024

Simple alcohols, methanol in particular, can be used both as a cosolvent and an electron donor for H2O2 generation.

After electrochemical cycling, thin films of damaged ionomer, enriched in C=C bonds, are observed near the Pt surface. This local degradation of the Pt-ionomer interface triggered by electrochemical oxidation contrasts with that from peroxide radical exposure.

Even more effective are bimetallic NiCu nanoparticles, which can provide a remarkable photocatalytic H-2 evolution enhancement compared to single-element Cu or Ni systems. The main concern of such alloyed co-catalysts is their activity with respect to alteration of their elemental composition and oxidation state over reaction time. Ex situ characterization techniques provide controversial interpretations of the co-catalytic role of the individual elements. Hypotheses such as the in situ reduction of "native" Ni or Cu species during photocatalysis, the oxidation of metallic Cu or Ni into oxides or hydroxides, or the formation of p-n junctions or core/shell structures have been proposed. Herein, we present an operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of a NiCu-TiO2 system under UV light illumination in ethanol-water solutions, i.e., under photocatalytic H-2 evolution conditions. The experimental approach allows for monitoring in real time chemical changes that take place in the co-catalyst under intermittent illumination, i.e., under light on-off cycles. We show that while Ni and Cu are partially oxidized in the as-formed NiCu co-catalyst (air-formed surface oxides or hydroxides) and undergo partial dissolution in the liquid phase under dark conditions, such Ni and Cu oxidized and dissolved species are reduced/redeposited as a bimetallic NiCu phase at the TiO2 surface under illumination. The dissolution/redeposition mechanism is triggered by TiO2 conduction band electrons. We not only prove a UV-light-induced healing of the NiCu co-catalyst but also unambiguously demonstrate that the species responsible for the strongly enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution of NiCu nanoparticles are the metallic states of Ni and Cu.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000027

Tandem catalysis that integrates the activation of CO or CO2 to an intermediate and the subsequent controllable C-C bond formation to form lower olefins offers a promising approach. Here, we report the hydrogenation of both CO and CO2 over bifunctional catalysts composed of a spinel binary metal oxide and SAPO-34. ZnAl2O4/SAPO-34 and ZnGa2O4/SAPO-34 are found to be highly selective for the synthesis of lower olefins from both CO and CO2. Our studies reveal that the oxygen vacancy site on metal oxides plays a pivotal role in the adsorption and activation of CO or CO2, while the -Zn-O- domain accounts for H-2 activation. We demonstrate that methanol and dimethyl ether formed on metal oxide are the reaction intermediates, which are subsequently converted to lower olefins by the Bronsted acid sites in zeolite. The hydrogenation of CO and CO(2 )on metal oxide surfaces proceeds via the same formate and methoxide species. We elucidate that the water-gas shift reaction on oxide surfaces is responsible for CO2 formation during syngas conversion. The cofeeding of CO2 in syngas offers a useful strategy to inhibit CO2 formation.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000028

Our study combines dassical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of different models for the enzyme-substrate complex and a detailed exploration of the reaction mechanism for the most plausible model using hybrid quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics techniques. Different enzyme-substrate models were built considering that the nucleophile in charge of the initial attack to the substrate could either be a water molecule or a hydroxide anion bridging between the two manganese(II) cations present in the active site. In contrast, for the substrate, we considered four different possibilities: one with the guanidino group of the substrate protonated and three of them where this group is neutral. In this last case, we considered two different tautomeric states and two possible coordination modes with the divalent ions. Our MD simulations revealed that the most stable complexes correspond to those having a hydroxide anion as the nucleophile, while both a protonated and a neutral form of the guanidino group can bind into the active site. Our analysis of the potential energy surface reveals a complex reaction pathway, where the initial attack of the nucleophile is followed by the inversion of the epsilon nitrogen atom of the guanidino group. It produces a reaction intermediate, stabilized by means of an H-pi interaction with a histidine residue, that shows high structural similitude with some of the most potent inhibitors known for HARGI (those derived from the 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid). Subsequently, a proton is transferred from the nucleophile to the leaving group via Asp128. The final step corresponds to the separation of the two reaction fragments: L-ornithine and urea. Our analysis is shown to be robust by comparison among the results obtained with different initial structures and functionals and also because of the good agreement with the experimental estimations of the activation energy and with mutagenesis analysis. Finally, the analysis of the electronic distribution demonstrates that manganese ions are not involved in charge-transfer processes during the reaction pathway, playing a structural and electrostatic role to stabilize the nucleophile and intermediate states of the reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000030

Synthetic approaches to functionalized steroids are important for generating steroidal agents for drug screening and development. However, chemical activation is challenging because of the predominance of inert, aliphatic C-H bonds in steroids. Here, we report the engineering of the stable, highly active bacterial cytochrome P450 enzyme P450BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium for the mono- and dihydroxylation of androstenedione (AD), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone (TST). In order to design altered steroid binding orientations, we compared the structure of wild type P450BM3 with the steroid C19-demethylase CYP19A1 with AD bound within its active site and identified regions of the I helix and the beta 4 strand that blocked this binding orientation in P450BM3. Scanning glycine mutagenesis across 11 residues in these two regions led to steroid oxidation products not previously reported for P450BM3. Combining these glycine mutations in a second round of mutagenesis led to a small library of P450BM3 variants capable of selective (up to 97%) oxidation of AD, DHEA, and TST at the widest range of positions (C1, C2, C6, C7, C15, and C16) by a bacterial P450 enzyme. Computational docking of these steroids into molecular dynamics simulated structures of selective P450BM3 variants suggested crucial roles of glycine mutations in enabling different binding orientations from the wild type, including one that closely resembled that of AD in CYP19A1, while other mutations fine-tuned the product selectivity. This approach of designing mutations by taking inspiration from nature can be applied to other substrates and enzymes for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000031

This has inspired the construction of artificial catalysts by the attachment of functional groups onto molecular scaffolds or solid supports to induce synergistic interactions. Herein, the transphosphorylation reaction is used as a model to demonstrate that cooperativity can also occur intermolecularly between multiple functional groups within self-assembled vesicular structures. We demonstrate that the modular and dynamic nature of such systems allow for triggered reorganization and the up- or down-regulation of catalytic activity. Such concepts have the potential to be used in the design of synergistic catalysts and their incorporation into responsive catalytic systems in water.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000033

Here, we report the use of a nonacidic MFI zeolite support, containing excess K+ beyond ion exchange capacity, well-dispersed Pt, and high Pt presence inside the pores, to maximize direct n-alkane aromatization selectivity. TGA, catalyst deactivation studies, and characterizations show that the smaller pore sizes and lack of large cages in the MFI support sterically inhibit coke formation inside the pores (0% in comparison to 4.9% over Pt/KL for n-octane aromatization), which also reduces dealkylation of ethylbenzene and o-xylene under mild conditions to give a more selective product distribution: 86% selectivity by weight toward C6 ring closure in comparison to 27% for Pt/KL. Additionally, using NH3-TPD, XPS, CO-DRIFTS, and STEM, we show the contribution of excess K+ as an inhibitor of strong acid sites, an indirect Pt electron promoter through improving metal-support interactions, and Pt dispersant. This work highlights the alternative use of well-understood zeolitic supports for the highly selective aromatization of n-heptane and n-octane by 1,6-ring closure, increasing the number of potential streams that can undergo direct aromatization and providing a suitable alternative to Pt/KL.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000037

How enzymes work and achieve their catalytic efficiency are some of the fundamental questions of life. Most studies have focused on specific enzymes to elucidate their reaction mechanisms and rate acceleration. No study, to our knowledge, has performed systematic analyses of the available properties of all six classes of enzymes. Here, we have systematically analyzed three parameters pertinent to enzyme catalysis, viz. activation free energy, substrate-binding free energy, and enzyme efficiency, which were estimated using the turnover number and the K-M value at a given temperature for each enzyme. By correlating these parameters with structural/biological information, including the presence/absence of inorganic and/or organic cofactors, the enzyme's oligomerization state, the monomer size, the cellular location, and the substrate specificity/promiscuity, we show that, despite the chemical, structural, and reaction diversity of the enzymes analyzed, the activation free energies, substrate-binding free energies, and enzyme efficiencies of most enzymes fall in a very characteristic narrow range of values. Various strategies are used by enzymes to confine the values of the catalytic parameters to such a narrow range. These include their location, their monomeric size or oligomeric state, their specificity, the environmental conditions, and the use of cofactors.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000038

The reported activating mechanism of the a-isomer was shown to require the initial formation of a transient C-1-O-2-C-2 epoxide that subsequently undergoes transformation to levoglucosan. Density functional theory results from maltose, a model compound for the alpha-isomer, show that the intramolecular C-2 hydroxyl group favorably interacts with lone pair electrons on the ether oxygen atom of an alpha-glycosidic bond in a manner similar to the hydroxymethyl (C-6 hydroxyl) group interacting with the lone pair electrons on the ether oxygen atom of a beta glycosidic bond. This mechanism has an activation energy of 219 kJ mol(-1), which is similar to the barriers reported for noncatalytic transglycosylation mechanism similar to 209 kJ mol(-1)) and in good agreement with experimentally measured barriers for a-cyclodextrin conversion at high temperatures. The results help explain the lack of sensitivity of depolymerization kinetics to glycosidic bond stereochemistry. Subsequent constrained ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that vicinal hydroxyl groups in the condensed environment of a reacting carbohydrate melt anchor transition states via two-to-three hydrogen bonds and lead to lower free energy barriers (similar to 134-155 kJ mol(-1)) in agreement with previous experiments.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000039

The photocatalyst efficiency of lignocellulose conversion is typically limited by the buffering redox system in combination with oxidation and reduction of the photoexcited holes and electrons, respectively, which ensures high charge-recombination rates. Herein, Ag+-exchanged CdS is employed for easy photoexcited electron transfer to the oxidized intermediate, which results in a marked increase in the conversion yield with high product selectivity under mild reaction conditions without any additives. The conversion yield of the lignin model compound under 6 W blue LED illumination is nearly 100% and only cleaved aromatic compounds are formed. The efficient photoredox CdS catalyst obtained via photoexcited electron-hole coupled transfer derived from an appropriate Ag+ exchange affords a promising method for lignocellulose conversion with reduced energy consumption.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000040

One of the key reasons for this poor operando durability is the surface oxidation of carbonaceous supports via Fenton(-like) reactions between the Fe centers and the intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an acidic medium, H2O2. In the present study, we have investigated the pH effect on the chemical deactivation of Fe-N-C catalysts by contacting them with a controlled amount of H2O2. Covering the entire pH range 0-14, we reveal a strong pH dependence of the H2O2-induced deactivation. Especially, acidic H2O2 treatment leads to a severe decrease in ORR activity while almost negligible deactivation is found after a treatment in a sufficiently strong alkaline electrolyte. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study reveals a positive correlation between the magnitude of Fe-N-C activity decrease and the signal intensity of the hydroxyl radical spin adduct after H2O2 treatment at a given pH. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as the hydroxyl radical is identified as a key deactivating agent of Fe-N-C catalysts operating from acidic to neutral pH environments. This result suggests that controlling the formation and lifetime of ROS at such pH is crucial to secure durable fuel cell operation with Fe-N-C cathodes. Alternatively, fuel cell operation under highly alkaline environment could also be considered to improve the catalytic durability, by virtue of a different Fenton(-like) reaction pathway at such pH.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000042

Use of excess I-2 to quench LCCTP provides the corresponding (+)- and (-)-iodo-terminated PMCP products.

However, the presence of a surfactant shell on the catalyst is detrimental, as the resulting performance of the electrocatalyst depends crucially on the ability of reactants to access active surface sites. Techniques for postsynthesis deprotection are therefore mandatory for removing the capping agents from the otherwise blocked reactions sites without compromising the structural integrity of the nanocatalysts. Herein, we present silver nanowires (Ag-NWs)-produced via PVP-assisted polyol synthesis (PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone)-as effective catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ec-CO2RR), which reach Faradaic efficiencies close to 100% for CO formation after deprotection by a so-called "electrochemical looping" (ec-l) pretreatment. Electrochemical looping refers to a sequence of potentiostatic CO2 electrolysis experiments that exhibit well-defined starting (E-start), vertex (E-vertex), and end (E-end) potentials. The resulting product distribution undergoes a profound hysteresis in the forward and corresponding backward run of the electrochemical looping experiment, thus pointing to an effective deprotection of the catalyst as made evident by postelectrolysis XPS inspection. These results can be considered as a prime example demonstrating the importance of the catalyst's "history" for the resulting ec-CO2RR performance. These transient (non-steady-state) effects are crucial in particular for the initial stage of the CO2 electrolysis reaction and for catalyst screening approaches carried out on the time scale of hours.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000044

Here, we show that Au-sites in Au/TiO2 surprisingly become blocked upon treatment in common alcohols (2-propanol and methanol), with 2-propanol causing a greater extent of blockage. Nearly 95% of Au-sites are covered after treatment in 2-propanol at room temperature, followed by desorption at 150 degrees C. Infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption unambiguously confirms the occurrence of this phenomenon. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Raman spectroscopy, and DFT simulations suggest that the formation of carbon deposits from 2-propanol decomposition and/or the migration of a TiOx layer over the supported NPs may be responsible for the blockage of Au-sites. Nearly full coverage of Au NPs after treatment in 2-propanol led to negligible activity for catalytic CO oxidation, whereas partial retraction of the overlayer led to enhanced activity with time-on-stream, suggesting a self-activating catalytic performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000045

This effect is traced back to an increased charge on the O-2 center dot center dot center dot gold/titania adsorption complex due to solvation by water, in addition to stabilization by protonation of the preactivated O-2 thanks to autodissociation of interfacial water molecules.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000047

Herein, a heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate was developed by coordinating the mononuclear Ru3+ center (Ru hereafter) with a N,P-containing polymer, which was synthesized from phosphonitrilic chloride trimer and 2,6-diaminopyridine. Multiple nitrogen functionalities in the polymer (N content: 25.9 wt %) containing pyridine nitrogen and phosphazene nitrogen not only provided an electron-rich coordination environment for stabilizing mononuclear Ru center but also facilitated CO2 conversion by interacting with CO2 molecules. The polymer-coordinated mononuclear Ru catalysts (Ru/p-dop-POMs) could promote the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate with a turnover number (TON) up to 25.4 x 10(3) in aqueous solutions, and the concentration of formate in the solution could reach 3.4 mol/L. DFT calculations revealed that the electron-rich mononuclear Ru site could promote H-2 dissociation, which is the rate-determining step in the reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Systemic studies demonstrated that the synergistic effect between individually electron-rich Ru centers and nitrogen-rich polymer enhanced catalytic efficiency.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000050

Controlled surface reactions were used to synthesize these bimetallic nanoparticles on both TiO2 and SiO2 supports. Chemisorption measurements of the bimetallic catalysts indicate that Pd prefers to be on the nanoparticle surface with a Cu parent catalyst, while Pd prefers to be subsurface with a Ag parent catalyst. From energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, the composition of the nanoparticles is determined to be more uniform on the SiO2 support compared to that on the TiO2 support. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results indicate that, after reduction, the CuPd bimetallic catalysts have some Pd-Pd bonds, but the average number of Pd-Pd bonds decreases after reaction. Infrared spectra of the adsorbed CO show that an increased fraction of isolated Pd species are present on the bimetallic catalysts compared to those on the monometallic catalysts. Adsorption of acetylene and ethylene, however, indicates adsorbed surface species that require contiguous Pd ensembles. These results suggest that the surface structure of the catalyst is highly dynamic and influenced by the gas environment, as well as the support. The catalysts are active for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in an ethylene-rich environment under mild conditions. Over all catalysts, the ethylene selectivity is greater than 92%; however, improved selectivity is observed over the bimetallic catalysts compared to that over the monometallic Pd catalysts. An ethylene selectivity of 100% is observed over the CuPd0.08/TiO2 catalyst. The highest acetylene conversion rate per gram of Pd is observed over the CuPd0.02/TiO2 catalyst, while the highest turnover frequency is found over the AgPd0.64/TiO2 catalyst. The bimetallic SiO2-supported catalysts have lower rates than Pd/SiO2 but still show improved selectivity. The combined characterization measurements and reaction kinetics studies indicate that the performance improvements of the bimetallic catalysts may be attributed to both electronic and geometric modifications of Pd by the parent Cu or Ag metal.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000051

Despite intense interest, the catalytic mechanism of MGATS is not known in detail, precluding therapeutic exploitation. We solved structures of MGATS complexed to glycosyl donor and acceptor ligands, revealing an unforeseen role for donor-induced loop rearrangements in controlling acceptor substrate engagement.

While physical and spectral characterizations fail to obtain most of these details because of interference from the electrolyte and dynamic surface structures under reaction conditions, electrochemical measurements instead are able to provide the most direct information. A thermodynamic-kinetic model was developed in our previous work, which showed great capability to extract the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates through the Tafel plot without considering the exact structures of catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a more adaptive model in combination with probing the methanol oxidation reaction was developed. This approach offers the following advantages: From the aspect of thermodynamics, an experimentally rationalized adsorption profile could be obtained without the requirement to know the scaling factors of reactive intermediates. From the aspect of surface structure, the potential induced change of intermediates' coverage in the reaction could be described with high sensitivity. From the aspect of kinetics, multiple Tafel slopes in a single Tafel plot could be explained by potential induced variation in intermediates' coverage and activation energy in the ratedetermining step (RDS). A volcano relation between the symmetry factor and adsorption energy was also discerned and discussed, showing the strong correlation between thermodynamics and kinetics. Our model offers a promising analyzing tool by providing essential information on the electrochemical interface and both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of catalysts, which are important for the design of next-generation high-performance catalysts for multistep electrochemical reactions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000054

In the last two decades, replication of the reactivity of non-heme iron oxygenases has become feasible even with simple coordination complexes of iron and manganese. A bonafide minimalistic functional model was the tetradentate-N4 ligand based iron complex [Fe(tpa)(CH3CN)(2)](2+)(Fe(tpa), tpa = tris(2-methylpyridyl)amine which activates H2O2 via a mechanism that mirrors key steps of enzymatic O-2 activation processes at mononuclear iron centers: controlled O-O bond cleavage, generation of a high-valent Fe=O oxidant, and promotion of almost the full spectrum of its oxidative reactivity (C-H hydroxylation, olefin epoxidation, syn-dihydroxylation, and desaturation). These landmark discoveries set the mechanistic framework to use iron coordination complexes with nitrogen-rich ligands as catalysts for oxidizing organic substrates under synthetically relevant conditions. Due to proof-of-concept demonstrations of the potential of these catalysts in organic synthesis, this chemistry has flourished over the past decade. In parallel to the realization of the potential of this class of catalysts in diverse organic transformations, effort has been spent to manipulate the catalyst structure with the aim of tuning both the reactivity and selectivity of the oxidation reactions. This perspective provides an overview of the progress of this research. Some key features of the archetypical Fe(tpa) catalyst have stayed surprisingly true throughout this evolution, but a series of alterations that modulate its electronic, steric, or binding properties allowed a rational elicitation of a specific reactivity or selectivity. In some cases, the replacement of iron by manganese has also proven beneficial. Overall, the rational optimization of the catalyst structure has enabled the development of highly asymmetric olefin epoxidation, syn-dihydroxylation, and site-selective and even enantioselective C-H oxidation reactions.									24	1	0	0	4	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000055

However, the underlying mechanism and contribution of interfacial/surface phenomena behind the pulsed potential application remain largely unknown. We investigated the state of the copper surface during the pulsed potential electrochemical CO2R using in situ X-ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES). We probed the surface valence of the metallic electrode and found that the Cu electrode remains metallic over a broad pulsed potential range and only oxidizes to form Cu(OH)(2) in the bulk when the pulsed potential reaches the highly oxidative limit (greater than 0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Our results suggest that the pulsed anodic potential influences the interfacial species on the electrode surface, i.e., the dynamic competition between protons and hydroxide adsorbates instead of bulk copper oxidation. We attribute the suppressed HER to the electroadsorption of hydroxides, which outcompetes protons for surface sites. As shown in a recent in situ infrared study [Iijima, G. et al.; ACS Catalysis 2019, 9, 6305], adsorbed hydroxides promote CO adsorption, a crucial CO2 reduction intermediate, by preventing CO from becoming inert through a near-neighbor effect. We corroborate this interpretation by demonstrating that the pulsed potential application can suppress the HER during the CO reduction just as the CO2R. Our results suggest that the pulsed potential mechanism favors CO2R over the HER due to two effects: (1) proton desorption/displacement during the anodic potential and (2) the accumulation of OHads, creating a higher pH-surface environment, promoting CO adsorption. We can describe this pulsed potential dynamic interfacial mechanism in a competing quaternary Langmuir isotherm model. The insights from this investigation have wide-ranging implications for applying pulsed potential profiles to improve other electrochemical reactions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000056

The iron-catalyzed reaction proceeded with predictable regioselectivity, engaging sterically accessible C-H bonds including orthoto-fluorine sites. The site selectivity for the catalytic HIE reaction was studied to identify the kinetic preferences for C-H activation. Structure- activity relationship studies with a series of iron precatalysts established that introduction of substituents at the 3- and S-positions of pyridine of the pincer significantly accelerated HIE. Mechanistic studies identified N-2 as an inhibitor of C-H activation, while H-2 served to generate the active catalyst.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000057

Nevertheless, it has often been reported that C-alpha-oxidation, rather than ether bond cleavage, is the main result of LMS treatments, which limits the overall efficiency and effectiveness. Remarkably few studies have attempted to influence this product profile and thereby enhance the effectivity of LMS-catalyzed lignin degradation. Here, we studied the influence of buffer properties on the product profile of a beta-O-4' linked lignin model dimer upon conversion by a laccase/hydroxybenzotriazole system. We show that the ratio between beta-O-4' ether cleavage and C a -oxidation can be substantially increased by using unconventional buffer properties (i.e., highly concentrated buffers at near-neutral pH). Whereas <10% ether cleavage was obtained in conventional buffer (i.e., weak buffer at pH 4), as much as 80% ether cleavage was obtained in highly concentrated buffers at pH 6. In addition, this alteration of buffer properties was found to improve the stability of both laccase and mediator. The underlying reactions were further studied by using experimental and computational (density functional theory, DFT) approaches. Based on the outcomes, we propose detailed reaction mechanisms for the reactions underlying ether cleavage and C-alpha-oxidation. We propose that increasing buffer pH or increasing buffer strength enhances H-bonding between the lignin model and buffer anions, which drives the overall reaction outcome toward ether cleavage. These insights may pave the way for more efficient and effective biocatalytic lignin degradation.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000059

The resulting Na-promoted CoFe2O4 catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes (Na-CoFe2O4/CNT) exhibited high CO2 conversion (similar to 34%) and light olefin selectivity (similar to 39%), outperforming other reported Fe-based catalysts under similar reaction conditions. Their performance was superior to that of single-metal NP catalysts (Na-Fe3O4/CNT and Na-Co/CNT) and a physically mixed (Na-Fe3O(4) + Co)/CNT catalyst. The superior performance of the Na-CoFe2O4/CNT catalyst can be attributed to the facile formation of a unique bimetallic alloy carbide (Fe1-xCox)(5)C-2, which results in higher CO2 conversion and better selectivity toward light olefins in comparison with conventional chi-Fe5C2 active sites derived from Fe-only catalysts and significantly improved heavy hydrocarbon (C2+) formation in comparison with the Co2C sites of Co-only catalysts. The single-source precursor CoFe2O4 exclusively forms a single-phase alloy carbide promoted by the Na promoter, whereas the mixed (Na-Fe3O4 + Co) precursor forms an isolated Co phase with the alloy carbide phase, promoting undesirable CH4 formation. An optimal value of x <= 0.2 for (Fe1-xCox)(5)C-2 was predicted using the cluster expansion method and density functional theory, resulting in a stable bimetallic alloy structure.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000060

Here, we report a template sacrificial method to fabricate an atomically dispersed Co catalyst; three C kinds of silica templates with different microstructures (MCM-41, SBA-15, and FDU-12) were employed and the effect of pore structure of the templates on the dispersity of Co was investigated. The catalysts fabricated with different templates presented different Co dispersities, leading to distinguishing catalytic performance. The optimized Co-1@NC-(SBA) catalyst with atomically dispersed Co displayed outstanding catalytic activity for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived species as well as the hydrogenation of various nitroaromatics. The reaction mechanism of the HDO of vanillin was investigated by using density functional theory calculations as well.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000061

Photocatalytic approaches have attracted widespread attention as promising options to turn pollutants into environmentally benign end products under favorable operating conditions. Although most approaches rely on the titanium dioxide (TiO2) structures, many other engineered photocatalytic materials can also be used to enhance overall efficiency and practicality of such systems. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the available options for discrete mitigation of NH3 in gaseous and aqueous matrixes. The performances of photocatalytic materials and systems are compared with respect to quantum and space-time yields. Special attention has been paid to the reaction mechanisms prevalent during photocatalytic removal of NH3 in each medium coupled with the production of end products (e.g., hydrogen and nitrogen) through NH3 splitting. The effects of process and operational variables (e.g., irradiation time, relative humidity, mode of operation, and environmental matrix type) on performance are also discussed along with the intrinsic properties of the applied materials (e.g., surface functional sites and structure). Existing obstacles, such as the formation of hazardous byproducts through complicated reaction pathways, are explored along with future challenges.									18	0	0	0	5	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000062

The photostability and charge separation of COFs are highly important to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic transformation. In this work, a fully conjugated donor-acceptor COF is constructed with a benzothiadiazole unit, which exhibits high stability and enhanced charge separation. The prepared COF can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anions under air and visible light, which mediate the photocatalytic oxidative amine coupling and cyclization of thioamide to 1,2,4-thiadiazole in moderate to high yield and high recyclability (18 examples). This study demonstrates the great capacity of fully conjugated COFs with a D-A structure for light-driven organic synthesis.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000063

As an important aspect of shape-selective catalysis, the significance of diffusion in conversion, deactivation, and product selectivity over molecular sieve catalysts has been recognized but still has not been interpreted quantitatively and explicitly. In the present work, direct tracking molecular diffusion in the SAPO-34 catalyst during the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction is successfully realized by combining the MTO reaction with the diffusivity evaluation by a pseudo-gas chromatography method which was operated in one catalyst bed under the real reaction condition. Diffusion behavior over the working catalyst can be measured along with the reaction to reflect the evolution in shape-selectivity catalysis in real time. For the first time, the accessibility of the catalyst microporous surface for the reactant was quantified during the reaction, which provided a rational understanding of the reaction and deactivation of MTO over the catalyst with continuous coke deposition. The evaluation of configurational diffusion hindrance in SAPO-34, because of the accumulation of organic species retained in the catalyst, corresponds well to the evolution of methanol conversion and product distribution and provides the scientific basis for manipulating the MTO reaction from the point of shape-selective catalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000064

This catalytic dehydrosilylation is one of the few examples of thermal catalytic functionalizations of unactivated alkylsilanes. The reaction involves transmetalation of an alkylsilane, beta-hydride elimination, release of the terminal olefin, and reoxidation of the palladium catalyst. A variety of linear internal olefins underwent the overall isomerization to terminal olefins in good yields and in good regioselectivities. Particularly noteworthy, isomerizations occurring over seven carbon units proceeded in yields that are comparable to those of isomerizations occurring over one carbon unit.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000065

Herein, an amorphous TiOx layer is introduced on the surface of crystalline TiO2 catalyst to form the core-shell structure (am@TiO2) via an oxidation corrosion method. Owing to the surface disordered TiO layer, the obtained ampTiO(2) exposes abundant -OH groups for the homogeneous loading of nanosized IrOx, while the charge carrier interfacial migration is substantially enhanced. The as-prepared IrOx-am@TiO2 exhibits photocatalytic water oxidation performance with an O-2 evolution rate of 143.6 mu mol/g.h, which is approximately 14 times higher than that of the bare ampTiO(2). Moreover, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.99% is obtained under LED-405 illumination. This work provides a direction for improving the photocatalytic performance and helps to gain a fundamental understanding of the water oxidation steps.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000066

The main drawback hindering its commercialization is the low selectivity to C-2-hydrocarbons due to their further oxidation to carbon oxides. In this respect, we focused on elucidating fundamentals of the previously reported positive effect of water on the activity and selectivity in the OCM reaction over MnOx-Na2WO4/SiO2 by means of steady-state kinetic and mechanistic tests at ambient pressure as well as temporal analysis of products with sub-millisecond resolution and isotopic tracers in vacuum. The obtained results cannot be rationalized by the earlier developed concepts explaining the role of water in the OCM reaction over this catalyst system. In addition, the selectivity-enhancing water effect was determined for MnOx/SiO2, MnOx/Al2O3, Na2WO4/SiO2, and Na2WO4/Al2O3, as well as SiO2-based materials with supported PbOx, ZrO2, or La2O3. No rate-improving effect was established for MnOx/Al2O3 and ZrO2/SiO2, while positive or negative effects were determined for PbOx/SiO2, MnOx/SiO2, and Na2WO4/SiO2 or La2O3/SiO2 and Na2WO4/Al2O3, respectively. Thus, testing other catalysts in the water presence seems to be promising in view of improving the OCM performance to an industrially attractive level. Owing to the developed protocol for catalyst testing under alternating water-free and water-containing OCM feeds, both reversible and irreversible water effects on the selectivity to C-2-hydrocarbons over MnOx-Na2WO4/SiO2 were identified. The irreversible effect was related to water-induced redispersion of MnOx. Mechanistic insights into the reversible rate- and selectivity-improving effects were derived from kinetic analysis of the rates of methane conversion into individual reaction products at different water partial pressures and temperatures. Selectivity-conversion relationships enabled us to understand the specific reaction pathways in the course of the OCM reaction affected by water. Water was established to increase the rates of methane conversion into C-2-hydrocarbons, CO, and CO2 with the strongest effect being determined for CO formation. For all the rates, the strength of the positive water effect decreases with an increase in temperature from 750 to 825 degrees C. In addition to the acceleration of methane conversion, water also helps to transform nonselective molecular-adsorbed oxygen species responsible for the direct oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000067

Several enantiocomplementary IREDs were identified for the synthesis of (R)- and (S)-5-chloro-2-(5-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)benzo[d]oxazole with high enan- tioselectivity. The catalytic efficiency of (R)-selective IRED from Leishmania major (IR1) and (S)-selective IRED from Micromonospora echinaurantiaca IR25) was 0.027 and 0.962 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively. To further improve the catalytic efficiency of IR1, its double mutant Y194F/D232H was identified by saturation mutagenesis and iterative combinatorial mutagenesis, which exhibited 61-fold in the catalytic efficiency relative to that of wild-type enzyme. The density functional calculations and molecular dynamics simulations provided some insights into the molecular basis for the improved activity of mutant Y194F/D232H. Furthermore, Y194F/D232H and IR25 were applied to access a range of different substituted 1,4-diazepanes with high enantiomeric excess (from 93 to >99%). This study offers an effective method for construction of chiral 1,4-diazepanes of pharmaceutical importance via imine reductase-catalyzed intramolecular reductive amination of the corresponding aminoketones.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000069

Catalytic conversion of biomass usually involves tandem activation and cleavage of C-C and C-O bonds. Some steps occur in the aqueous phase and demand catalysts of high water resistance. Water-resistant ceria with redox and acid-base synergistic catalytic sites has attracted great interests particularly for biomass upgradation. The reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pairs and the existence of oxygen vacancies improve its redox ability and thus catalytic activity. Besides, the acid-base properties enable its use in acid-base catalytic reactions. The strength or concentration of acid-base sites is tailorable. The water-tolerance character is unique and thus can be employed in the conversion of dilute aqueous biomass solutions. In this Perspective, we summarize the latest research progress in the high-value utilization of biomass feedstocks, including biomass raw materials, platform molecules originated from biomass as well as its derivatives and downstream chemicals over pure CeO2, doped CeO2, and CeO2-supported metal catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000070

Her; we develop a catalyst of Pt nanoparticles on Al2O3 that exhibits extremely high activity with 100% CO conversion at -20 degrees C and orders of magnitude higher specific rate than current commercial catalysts. Detailed catalyst characterizations reveal the presence of metallic Pt sites and positively charged ones associated with the OH species in Pt/Al2O3. Both experimental data and theoretical calculations suggest that CO adsorbed on Pt(OH) kink sites reacts with OH species covering Pt-0 terrace sites to release CO2. Afterward, O-2 is facilely activated on terrace sites to regenerate OH. The presence of OH species and the synergy between Pt kink and terrace sites on the Pt species lead to an ultralow reaction barrier for CO oxidation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000071

However, low surface areas and incomplete release of metal from the lattice have prevented the widespread application of these materials. Here, we describe the preparation of thin perovskite films on stable supports by atomic layer deposition (ALE)) as a means for avoiding the limitations associated with bulk perovskites. Examples will be given which demonstrate that many of the favorable properties of perovskite supports can be retained, while avoiding some of the shortcomings.

Zeolite-encapsulated nanoparticles have been shown to be an effective catalyst architecture to regulate the sequence in which reactants and intermediates are exposed to different types of active sites in tandem reactions. In this work, pore size engineering of the encapsulating zeolite matrix is demonstrated to be an effective strategy to exercise selectivity control in tandem reaction involving bulky intermediates and products. Pt nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in H-BEA zeolites (Pt@H-BEA) are able to catalyze a one-step conversion of biomass-derived cyclopentanone (CPO) to C-10 cyclic hydrocarbons (bicyclopentane and decalin) with a combined yield of 78%, which is the first report of accomplishing the conversion of CPO to biojet fuels in one step. In contrast, Pt NPs encapsulated in MFI zeolites with smaller micropores with similar metal and acid site densities lead to primarily cyclopentane (similar to 70%). Kinetic analysis shows that the difference in pore size between these two zeolite frameworks is the primary cause for the drastic change in selectivity, likely due to the higher energetic barriers of formation and diffusion of bulky active complex, intermediates, and products. Pt NPs supported on either H-BEA or H-ZSM-5 are unselective toward C-10 cyclic hydrocarbons in the CPO conversion, indicating the importance of the encapsulated catalyst architecture. Pt@H-BEA exhibits excellent recydability with no detectable deactivation after three regeneration cycles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000075

Herein we fabricate a nanoporous gold electrocatalyst by electrochemical dealloying of potential cycling, which enables reducing carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide with a Faradaic efficiency of up to 98% at an overpotential of 390 mV. Pb-upd measurements verify that the high activity stems from the high density of step/kink sites with geometrically needed high-index facets on the curved internal surface. Moreover, a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ stripping voltammograms reveals that catalysis decay during long-term stability test results from the reduction of surface step/kink sites and the deposition of metal impurities (Zn, Pb, and Cu). The catalytic performance of the deactivated electrode can be recovered by applying potential cycling, which can restore the fractions of step/kink sites and remove surface metal impurities simultaneously.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000076

Using density functional theory, the Zn-catalyzed copolymerization mechanism has been characterized with a particular focus on the effects of chiral beta-diiminate (BDI) ligands as they influence the reactivity and enantioselectivity in the epoxide ring-opening step, where the latter is required for isotacticity. Theory indicates that both mono- and binuclear forms of the catalyst are involved along the reaction path, with the turnover-limiting step being ring-opening of the epoxide mediated by a binuclear catalyst. Subsequent CO2 insertion is predicted to be kinetically facile and preferentially mediated by a mononuclear catalyst. The predicted preference for epoxide opening to give R,R-stereocenters in the copolymer when N-(4-(((1S,2S)-2-(benzyloxy)cyclohexyl)amino)-5,5,S-trifluor- opent-3-en-2-ylidene)-2,6-dimethylaniline is used as the BDI ligand agrees with the experiment and is attributed to differential ligand distortions associated with key non-bonded interactions in the competing transition-state structures. Further analysis predicts that 2,6-dichloro and dibromo substitutions of the BDI ligand N-aryl groups) should result in increased rates and enantioselectivities for copolymerization.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000077

Its robust nature has meant-in the past-that selective manipulation of this motif remained elusive. The reductive activation through hydrosilylation of tertiary amides-using Vaska's complex (IrCl(CO)-(PPh3)(2))-has emerged as a powerful strategy for the chemo-selective transformation of amides into reactive enamines and iminium ions. Furthermore, these synthetically valuable species can be accessed in the presence of traditionally more reactive functional groups. This approach to amide reductive activation via hydro- silylation has been exploited in a range of downstream C-C bond forming processes and has seen significant applications in total synthesis, enabling streamlined routes for the synthesis of complex natural product architectures. This perspective covers the development of this synthetic strategy, from initial hydrosilylation studies to its flourishing use in the reductive functionalization of amide-containing molecules, both simple and complex.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000078

Both methylations with methanol (MeOH) and dimethyl ether (DME) are investigated via both stepwise and concerted mechanisms. Calculations are carried out using periodic density functional theory corrected by high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations on cluster models. While we find little selectivity between the methylations of different aromatics, our calculations indicate that isomerization via methyl shifts between different isomers is a viable mechanism with barriers comparable to methylation. The generally observed trend is that MeOH methylation barriers are smaller than those using DME, with the difference between MeOH and DME increasing with the level of methylation of the aromatic molecule.									2	0	1	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000081

This work introduces ZnO-containing ZrO2- or MZrOx -supported (M = Ce, La, Ti or Y) catalysts. The most active materials outperformed the state-of-the-art catalysts with supported CrOx, GaOx, ZnOx, or VOx species as well as bulk ZrO2-based catalysts without ZnO. The space-time yield of propene of 1.25 kg(C3H6).kg(cat)(-1).h(-1) at a propane conversion of about 30% with a propene selectivity of 95% was obtained over Zn(4 wt %)/TiZrOx at 550 degrees C. For deriving key insights into the structure of active sites, reactivity, selectivity, and onstream stability, the catalysts were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, EDX mapping, XPS, X-ray absorption, CO-TPR, CO2-TPD, NH3-TPD, pyridine-FTIR, operando UV-vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, TPO, and temporal analysis of products. In contrast with previous reports that used bulk ZrO2-based catalysts without ZnO, coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations are not the main active sites in the ZnO-containing catalysts. Supported ZnO, species were concluded to participate in the PDH reaction. The current X-ray absorption analysis proved that their structure is affected by the type of metal oxide used as a dopant for ZrO2 and by the crystallinity of ZrO2. Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species were concluded to show high activity and on-stream stability. Their intrinsic activity is enhanced when TiO2 and ZrO2 coexist in the support or when ZrO2 is promoted by TiO2. This is probably due to accelerating hydrogen formation in the course of the PDH reaction as concluded from temporal analysis of products with sub-millisecond resolution. The results of temperature-programmed oxidation of spent catalysts as well as ex situ Raman and operando UV-vis studies enabled us to conclude that the high on-stream stability of isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species in the PDH reaction is related to their low ability to form coke. In general, the tendency for coke formation seems to increase with an increase in the degree of ZnOx agglomeration.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000083

Herein, Pd supported on mesoporous Fe2O3 with a high specific surface area was rationally designed and chosen to construct the Pd/iron oxide interface. As a versatile model, the physicochemical environments of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) could be precisely controlled by taming the reduction temperature. The experimental and density functional theory calculation results unveiled that the catalyst in the support-metal interface confinement (SMIC) state showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and sintering resistance for CO oxidation. The constructed Fe sites at the interfaces between FeOx overlayers and Pd NPs not only provided additional coordinative unsaturated ferrous sites for the adsorption and activation of O-2, thereby facilitating the activation efficiency of O-2, but also impressively changed the reaction pathway of CO oxidation. As a result, the catalyst followed the Pd/Fe dual-site mechanism instead of the classical Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. For the catalyst in the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) state, its catalytic activity was seriously suppressed because of the excessive encapsulation of the active Pd sites by FeOx overlayers. The present study therefore provides detailed insights into the SMIC and SMSI in ferric oxide-supported Pd catalysts, which could guide the preparation of highly efficient supported catalysts for practical applications.									31	1	0	0	4	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000084

A detailed mechanistic study provided insight into the species responsible for this induction period and guided efforts to remove them. High-resolution electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and density functional theory computations revealed that a mu-hydroxide and a bridged 1,2-hydroxypropanolate complex are present during the induction period. Kinetic studies and additional computation indicated that the mu-hydroxide complex is a short-lived catalyst arrest state, where hydroxide dissociation from one metal allows for epoxide enchainment to form the 1,2-hydroxypropanolate arrest state. While investigating anion dependence on the induction period, it became apparent that catalyst activation was the main contributor for dormancy. Using a 1,2-diol or water as chain transfer agents (CTAs) led to longer induction periods as a result of increased 1,2-hydroxyalkanolate complex formation. With a minor catalyst modification, rigorous drying conditions, and avoiding 1,2-diols as CTAs, the induction period was essentially removed.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000085	34367720

Traditional oxidative additions of aryl chlorides to Pd complexes are known to be orders of magnitude faster than with aryl fluorides, and many palladium catalysts do not activate aryl fluorides at all. The experimental and computational studies outlined herein, however, support the view that at elevated Grignard/ArX ratios (i.e., 2.5:1), a Pd-Mg heterobimetallic mechanism predominates, leading to a remarkable decrease in the energy required for Ar-F bond activation. The heterobimetallic transition state for the C-X bond cleavage is proposed to involve simultaneous Pd backbonding to the arene and Lewis acid activation of the halide by Mg to create a low-energy transition state for oxidative addition. The insights gained from this computational study led to the development of a phosphine ligand that was shown to be similarly competent for Ar-F bond activation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800046	34221636

Treatment of the Fe complex with 1 equiv of diphenylacetylene results in the formation of a bimetallic bridging alkyne complex, along with dissociation of IPr from Fe. At elevated temperatures, the bridging alkyne complex undergoes oxidative coupling to form a dimetallacyclopentadiene complex, formally by a one-electron oxidation at each metal center. Each complex catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of diphenylacetylene. Kinetic studies exhibit first-order dependence on the bimetallic complexes, providing further support for the presence of these species in the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations support the experimental mechanistic data and suggest that the catalytic cycle is completed by binding of an alkyne to the diene complex, followed by insertion to form a hexatriene species that then undergoes ring closure to form an inverse sandwich complex, [DIPP(Me3Si)N]Fe(eta(6)-arene)Fe[N(SiMe3)DIPP]. The arene product is then displaced by alkyne to close the catalytic cycle.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800031

Her; we show a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic, and in situ spectroscopy measurements to probe the rWGS and methanation of carbon dioxide on a CeO2-dispersed isolated Ru catalyst (Ru-SnOx/CeO2, structure confirmed by HAADF-STEM) derived from the [Ru@Sn-9](6-) Zintl cluster decoration. Kinetic measurements, in combination with isotopiclabeling reactions, prove that rWGS and methanation occur through the kinetically relevant C-O bond rupture of surface carboxyl (HOCO*) and surface formate (HCOO*) respectively. A site-selective reaction model has been established on the basis of the response of rWGS and methanation to water pressure. Probably, the rWGS was carried out at the interface between the transition-metal nanoparticles and the support and could be influenced greatly by water, while the methanation was carried out at a site far away from the interface and has a weak dependence on water. This system can be easily extended to some other hydrogenation reactions, thus attracting attention to building isolated structures with Zintl clusters.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800032

Because of its high cost, NADH has to be necessarily regenerated from cheap and affordable raw materials. Herein, we show that the combination of the [Cp*Ir(R-pysa)NO3] (pysa = kappa(2)-pyridine-2-sulfonamidate; R = H, 4-CF3, and 6-NH2) complexes and H-P(O)(OH)(2) as hydride source constitutes a top-performing system for the chemical regeneration of NADH. Particularly, the enhanced metal acidity induced by the electronwithdrawing -S(O)(2)- bridge, between the -NH amide functionality and the pyridine-ring, and the presence of the -NH2 substituent in proximity to the metal are the key factors for obtaining the highest activity ever reported for the chemical regeneration of NADH (TOF up to 3731 h(-1), T = 313 K, pH = 6.58 by 0.4 M phosphite buffer), approaching that of enzymes.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800047

To monitor electrostatic changes along important steps during catalysis, we used a nitrile probe (T46C-CN) inserted proximal to the reaction center of three dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) with different biophysical properties, Escherichia coli DHFR (EcDHFR), its conformationally impaired variant (EcDHFR-S148P), and Geo bacillus stearothermophilus DHFR (BsDHFR). Our combined experimental and computational approach revealed that the electric field projected by the substrate toward the probe negates those exerted by the cofactor when both are bound within the enzymes. This indicates that compared to previous models that focus exclusively on subdomain reorganization and protein-ligand contacts, ligand-ligand interactions are the key driving force to generate electrostatic environments conducive for catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800042	32905264

A two-electron electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (2e(-) ORR) is a clean and on-site method for H2O2 production. Here, we report metal-free catalysts (mesoporous carbon hollow spheres, MCHS) for high-efficiency H2O2 production in neutral electrolytes (0.1 M PBS). The selectivity of H2O2 on MCHS catalysts is higher than 90% at a wide range of potentials (0.35-0.62 V), and it can reach 99.9% at a potential of 0.57 V. These catalysts show some of the best performances for H2O2 production in neutral electrolytes. It is preferable to develop H2O2 catalysts in a neutral environment, as the pH of the stabilizers used for H2O2 is also close to neutral. The outstanding activity of our catalyst comes from a combination of factors such as suitable porosity, the content of oxygen functional groups, and the types of different species of oxygen functional groups. First-principles simulations show that a catalyst with suitable mixed oxygen and COOH functional groups plays an important role in the catalytic formation of H2O2. The reported metal-free catalysts are promising catalysts for high-efficiency production of H2O2 in the future.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800001

[Rh(DPEphos)H-2](2) can be generated in situ from Rh(DPEphos)(benzyl) and catalyzes polyaminoborane formation (H2BNMeH)(n) [M-n = 15 000 g mol(-1)]. Closely related Rh-(Xantphos)(benzyl) operates at 0.1 mol % to give a higher molecular weight polymer [M-n = 85 000 g mol(-1)] on the gram scale with low residual [Rh], 81 ppm.

P.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 552-563]. For the neutral [Co-III(TAML(sq))] complex, this leads to the doublet (S = 1/2) mono-nitrene radical species [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(Y)] (bearing an unidentified sixth ligand Y in at least the frozen state), while a triplet (S = 1) bis-nitrene radical species [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(2)](-) is generated from the anionic [Co-III(TAML(red))](-) complex. The one-electron-reduced Fischer-type nitrene radicals (N(center dot)Ns(-)) are formed through single (mono-nitrene) or double (bis-nitrene) ligand-to-substrate single-electron transfer (SET). In this work, we describe the reactivity and mechanisms of these nitrene radical complexes in catalytic aziridination. We report that [Co-III(TAML(sq))] and [Co-III(TAML(red))](-) are both effective catalysts for chemoselective (C=C versus C-H bonds) and diastereoselective aziridination of styrene derivatives, cyclohexane, and 1-hexene under mild and even aerobic (for [Co-III(TAML(red))](-)) conditions. Experimental (Hammett plots; [Co-III(TAML)]-nitrene radical formation and quantification under catalytic conditions; single-turnover experiments; and tests regarding catalyst decomposition, radical inhibition, and radical trapping) in combination with computational (density functional theory (DFT), N-electron valence state perturbation theory corrected complete active space self-consistent field (NEVPT2-CASSCF)) studies reveal that [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(Y)], [Co-III(TAML(q))(N(center dot)Ns)(2)](-), and [Co-III(TAML(sq))(N(center dot)Ns)](-) are key electrophilic intermediates in aziridination reactions. Surprisingly, the electrophilic one-electron-reduced Fischer-type nitrene radicals do not react as would be expected for nitrene radicals (i.e., via radical addition and radical rebound). Instead, nitrene transfer proceeds through unusual electronically asynchronous transition states, in which the (partial) styrene substrate to TAML ligand (single-) electron transfer precedes C-N coupling. The actual C-N bond formation processes are best described as involving a nucleophilic attack of the nitrene (radical) lone pair at the thus (partially) formed styrene radical cation. These processes are coupled to TAML-to-cobalt and cobalt-to-nitrene single-electron transfer, effectively leading to the formation of an amido-gamma-benzyl radical (NsN-CH2-(CH)-C-center dot-Ph) bound to an intermediate spin (S = 1) cobalt(III) center. Hence, the TAML moiety can be regarded to act as a transient electron acceptor, the cobalt center behaves as a spin shuttle, and the nitrene radical acts as a nucleophile. Such a mechanism was hitherto unknown for cobalt-catalyzed hypovalent group transfer and the more general transition-metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer to alkenes but is now shown to complement the known concerted and stepwise mechanisms for N-group transfer.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800003

Here, we shed light on the atomic-scale structure of hybrid Pt/FeNC catalysts (1-2 wt % of Pt), revealing, via scanning tunnelling electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the presence of Pt@FeOx particles. The absence of exposed Pt on the surface is confirmed by the suppression of methanol oxidation reaction and CO stripping experiments. The promising application of such Pt/FeNC catalysts, comprising FeNx sites and Pt@FeOx particles, is demonstrated at the cathode of DMFC. To gain fundamental understanding on the stability in acid medium and on the intrinsic ORR activity of Pt@FeOx, we constructed model surfaces by depositing FeOx films with controlled thickness (from 1.0 nm to 6.4 nm), fully covering the Pt(111) surface, which resulted stable in acid medium in the potential range of 0.45-1.05 V vs RHE. The specific ORR activity of Fe2O3/Pt(111) increases exponentially with decreasing overlayer thickness, which is explained by the tunneling of Pt electrons through Fe2O3. This special phenomenon sheds light onto recently reported excellent durability of Pt/FeNC composites in PEMFC and identify a promising core@shell strategy leading to stable PGM-free surfaces in acid medium, and tolerant to methanol.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800005

Formate is an ideal electron donor for cofactor regeneration due to its general availability, low reduction potential, and benign byproduct (CO2). However, formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) are usually specific to NAD(3), such that NADPH regeneration with formate is challenging. Previous studies reported naturally occurring FDHs or engineered FDHs that accept NADP(+), but these enzymes show low kinetic efficiencies and specificities. Here, we harness the power of natural selection to engineer FDH variants to simultaneously optimize three properties: kinetic efficiency with NADP(+), specificity toward NADP(+), and affinity toward formate. By simultaneously mutating multiple residues of FDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101, which exhibits practically no activity toward NADP(+), we generate a library of >10(6) variants. We introduce this library into an E. coli strain that cannot produce NADPH. By selecting for growth with formate as the sole NADPH source, we isolate several enzyme variants that support efficient NADPH regeneration. We find that the kinetically superior enzyme variant, harboring five mutations, has 5-fold higher efficiency and 14-fold higher specificity in comparison to the best enzyme previously engineered, while retaining high affinity toward formate. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the contribution of each mutation to the superior kinetics of this variant. We further determine how nonadditive epistatic effects improve multiple parameters simultaneously. Our work demonstrates the capacity of in vivo selection to identify highly proficient enzyme variants carrying multiple mutations which would be almost impossible to find using conventional screening methods.									7	1	0	0	4	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800008	32733773

In this paper, strong-base-modified covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were reported to be effective in the cleavage of the beta-O-4 linkage. With the modification, the cleavage rate of the beta-O-4 linkage was enhanced remarkably. Insight into the catalytic mechanism illustrated that the strong basic sites assisted the activation of C-beta-H bonds, which accounted for the promotion effect. The catalyst was further applied to the depolymerization of organosolv lignin, which showed 87% conversion of the beta-O-4 linkage. This strategy should be useful in the catalyst design for lignin depolymerization.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800009

Tetrabutylammonium decatungstate and anthraquinone were found to act as synergistic HAT photocatalysts. Density PC isolated yield functional theory calculations suggested a Pd-0-Pd-II-Pd-III-Pd-I-Pd-0 pathway and revealed that regeneration of the Pd-0 catalyst and the photocatalyst occurs simultaneously in the presence of KHCO3. This regeneration features a low energy barrier, promoting efficient coupling of the palladium catalytic cycle with the photocatalytic cycle. The work reported herein suggests great promise for further applications of HAT photocatalysis in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling and C-H functionalization reactions to be successful.									17	1	0	0	5	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800011

We rationally designed several variants with up to 30-fold increased acyl transfer to hydrolysis ratios while mostly retaining initial activity. Variants exhibiting broader acyl-donor substrate scope and higher or inverted enantioselectivity were also designed. Alterations of the catalytic His-Asp pair decreased the activation of hydrolytic water, thereby increasing acyl transfer to hydrolysis ratios. This study demonstrates that targeting the disruption of water networks and manipulating the activation of nucleophiles are promising strategies for engineering promiscuous acyltransferase activities.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800012

This transformation is accomplished through the reaction of alkyl aldehydes with alkynes in the presence of dipropylamine and Hantzsch ester catalyzed by a P/N heteroleptic Cu(I)-based photosensitizer under photoredox catalysis conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that this aldehyde-alkyne coupling process comprises a regioselective radical addition of in situ-generated alkyl-substituted alpha-amino radicals to alkynes with subsequent 1,5-proton transfer, C-N bond cleavage, and concomitant isomerization of the resulting allyl radical species. Thus, in net result, dipropylamine serves as a traceless linker agent for the deoxygenative radical cross-coupling of alkyl aldehydes with alkynes under photoredox catalysis reaction conditions.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800013

As the single metal atoms are stabilized by coordination bonds with the substrate, the strong metal-support interactions can be exploited for ready manipulation of the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward target reactions. However, most single-atom catalysts (SACs) are prepared by pyrolysis and contain a wide range of coordination structures. Resolving the atomic configurations of the metal coordination moieties represents a critical first step in the establishment of an unambiguous correlation between the SAC structure and activity. In this Review, we summarize recent progress in the studies of single-atom electrocatalysts, with a focus on the impacts of the coordination structure of the single-atom sites on the electrocatalytic activities toward a series of reactions that are important for various electrochemical energy technologies, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and so on. The survey entails a wide range of SACs, from noble metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ru, Ir, Au, etc.) to non-noble metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.), supported on a variety of substrate materials (e.g., pristine and doped carbon, metal, metal oxide, metal sulfide, etc.). Finally, the Review concludes with a perspective highlighting the promises and challenges in the further development of SACs within the context of coordination chemistry.									63	0	0	0	3	0	63			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800015

However, the sole production of alkenes from the ODH process is significantly important but remains a great challenge due to the uncontrollable oxygen species for overoxidized products. Here, we report a sulfate-modified NiAl mixed oxide derived from layered double hydroxide that exhibits similar to 100% ethylene selectivity at 10% ethane conversion using N2O as a representative soft oxidant, which surpasses the previously reported catalysts. Extensive characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the sulfate modifier favors the formation of more species Ni3+ and promotes the isolation of electrophilic oxygen (O-) species through electronic and steric effects. Different from the conventional cognition of electrophilic oxygen species leading to overoxidation, we identify that the increase of the proportion of isolated electrophilic oxygen species determines the higher selectivity of ethylene. The isolated oxygen species are favorable for the effective breakage of C-H bonds of ethane to selectively produce ethylene with facile desorption, while the adjacent ones strongly bind ethylene and excessively break the C-H bonds to overoxidation. More importantly, the sulfate-modification strategy for increasing ethylene selectivity can be extendable to not only the CO2-assisted ODH reaction but also to other catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800016

Recently, the coating of catalysts to control their deactivation has generated much research traction. This Review is aimed at studying different encapsulation techniques employed for controlling catalyst deactivation. Focus is given to the prevention of irreversible modes of deactivation, such as sintering and leaching. In this Review, we elaborate on different entrapment methods used to protect catalysts from deactivation in both liquid and gas reaction media. Relevant probe reactions are discussed with emphasis on the catalyst activity and stability. Challenges associated with those processes are also described with emphasis on the mass transfer limitations as a result of the coverage of the active sites. Finally, some future perspectives and areas for possible improvement are highlighted.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800017

The validity of those predictions depends on the applied simulation protocol and its capability to account for all relevant aspects of the catalytic system. Commonly used approaches often only include an approximative treatment of solute-solvent interactions and neglect dynamic effects occurring at ambient temperature. In order to go beyond those limitations, we rely on a density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulation protocol, which shows that the inclusion of those effects is essential in order to understand the O-O bond formation process in various facets. In this work, we focus on the effects of a modification to the Py5 ligand framework of a Ru-based WOC. Previously, it was suggested that increasing the basicity of the pyridyl subunit results in a lower activation barrier for the O-O bond formation [Dalton Trans. 2018, 47, 10780-10490]. We take advantage of the metadynamics method to efficiently explore the O-O bond formation event using DFT-MD. This allows us not only to investigate in detail the beneficial effect an increased basicity has on the O-O bond formation but also to rationalize its origin and complexity that is in part found in the structure of the first solvation shell of the catalyst.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800018

In addition, because the cyano group can undergo various diversifying reactions, they are very versatile chiral building blocks for the synthesis of optically active aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carboxamides, amines, and N-heterocycles such as tetrazolium. Accordingly, the catalytic enantioselective cyanation reaction, as one of the most important C-C bond forming reactions, has been intensely studied in the past three decades. While traditional efforts mainly focus on the addition of the cyanide to highly polarized electrophiles as well as alkene hydrocyanation, intriguing directions in enantioselective cyanations have been opened, including the development of enantioselective alkene cyanofunctionalization, cyanation via C-H bond functionalization, and C-C bond cleavage, as well as the invention of bifunctional cyanating agents to design asymmetric tandem synthesis and to exploit enantioselective cyanide-free cyanation reactions. Additionally, significant advances have also been made in developing unprecedented chiral catalysts to address a long-term challenge, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse C-alpha-tetrasubstituted or quaternary alpha-chiral nitrites. This perspective aims to highlight these impressive advances, illustrates their key advantages and future applications, and provides some inspiration for related research.									17	1	0	0	5	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800019

While necessary, their presence adversely impacts the performance of the catalyst. PEMFC catalyst performance losses associated with Nafion ionomers are due to physical barriers to reactant gas transport and loss of active sites through specific adsorption of polymer-bound sulfonate groups on the catalyst surface. These impacts are particularly damaging for PEMFC high current density (HCD) performance. Here, we show that ionic liquids (IL) present at the catalyst interface can act to prevent the specific adsorption of sulfonate groups of Nafion on Pt surfaces, negating the detrimental impact of the ionomer on reaction rates, specifically for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This result holds promise for further Pt loading reductions in PEMFCs.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800020

In this work, we report Pd/C and Sn-Pd/C nanocatalysts for the base-free aerobic oxidation of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin, a challenging reaction not only in the fundamental research of selective oxidation of alcohols but also for the practical transformation of bio-based alcohols to value-added chemicals. We effectively tuned the mean size of Pd nanoparticles from 1.8 to 6.7 nm by varying the temperature used for catalyst preparation and further modified the electron density of the Pd/C catalyst by adding a SnO2 promoter with different loadings. TEM, HAADF-STEM, XPS, CO chemisorption, and in situ DRIFT-IR of CO adsorption characterizations allowed us to get insight into the unique catalytic properties of Pd nanocatalysts. It was conjectured that the base-free aerobic oxidation of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin over the Pd/C catalyst can be a structure-sensitive reaction and the Pd particle size was decisive for the dispersion of Pd, the proportion of catalytically active Pd-0 sites, and the intrinsic turnover frequency (iTOF). The 1 wt % Pd/C (1.8 nm) catalyst showed an iTOF value of 268 h(-1) and 100% yield to vanillin at 120 degrees C, 5 bar of O-2 , and 20 mg of the catalyst within 9 h. We further demonstrated that Sn4+ ions in SnO2 as an electronic promoter can promote Pd/C activity by the formation of highly active, electron-sufficient Pd-0 sites which significantly lowered the apparent activation energy of reaction. The 0.1Sn-Pd/C catalyst showed a higher iTOF value of 458 h(-1) and a yield of 100% to vanillin at 120 degrees C, 3 bar of O-2 and 15 mg of the catalyst within 6 h. Moreover, we verified a satisfying reusability and an adequate substrate scope over the 0.1Sn-Pd/C catalyst.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800021

DFT data support a pallada-ene process and shed light on the critical role of hemilabile interactions between the Pd center and the bulky biaryl phosphine. Significantly, these Pd(0) catalysts are also effective for promoting intermolecular formal cycloadditions between ACPs and trifluoromethyl ketones, thus providing for a direct entry to chiral tetrahydrofuran moieties (THFs) bearing trifluoromethyl-substituted carbons.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800022

Thus, the design and development of efficient and selective asymmetric catalysts are undoubtedly required. To solve this demanding situation, the discovery of innovative catalyst motifs, including unreported structural backbones or activation modes, that are able to overcome the actual limitations is essential. This Review discloses the mechanically interlocked molecules as emerging and powerful chiral catalysts, including their use as both organocatalysts and ligands in metal-mediated reactions. The structural and conformational properties of these entwined scaffolds, including their finely controllable responsiveness, make them privileged, although still underexplored, players in asymmetric catalysis.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800023

To this end, we have investigated structure-activity relationships in Pb2Ru2O7-x having pyrochlore structure by tuning the structural oxygen vacancy (O-vac) and metal oxidation states. Increase in O-vac with temperature boosts the ORR. activity by facilitating molecular oxygen dissociation via decrease in work function. O-vac formation is accompanied by lowering of the Ru(V)/Ru(IV) ratio due to charge-compensation which leads to decreased OER activity. Air-annealing of Pb2Ru2O7-x accelerates the formation of O-vac in comparison to Ar-annealing since atmospheric oxygen facilitates the reduction and phase-segregation of Ru from Pb2Ru2O7-x as RuO2. A maximum bifunctionality index and specific bifunctionality index of 0.69 V and 274.0 mu A/cm(BET)(2), respectively, are observed for pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x However, the activity is skewed toward OER for pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x creating an asymmetric bifunctional property which is not desirable for practical applications. To reduce the asymmetric behavior, pristine and air-annealed Pb2Ru2O7-x samples at 700 degrees C are physically mixed which yields a higher symmetric OER/ORR activity (vertical bar Delta i(OER(eta = 0.2.5 V)-ORR(eta = -0.45) (specific)(V))vertical bar: pristine = 0.25 mA/cm(BET)(2) , Air-700 degrees C = 0.20 mA/cm(BET)(2), physical mixture = 0.037 mA/cm(BET)(2)). The inverse OER/ORR relationship in Pb2Ru2O7-x is attributed to the presence of an optimal ratio of 0.75 for Ru(V)/Ru(IV) and O-vac/O-lattice which provides symmetric bifunctional activity essential in electrochemical devices. An increase in Ru(V)/Ru(IV) ratio in pristine Pb2Ru2O7-x with no detectable Ru dissolution in the electrolyte observed subsequent to a 5-h OER hold-test, confirming high stability.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800024

One important but open question is the origin of poisoning during the photoreaction of primary alcohols on a bare, reduced rutile TiO2(110) crystal under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. By comparing the photocatalytic properties of methanol and 2-methyl-2-pentanol, it is demonstrated that the fading activity in methanol photoreforming does not originate from the often-assigned increase of trap states for photon-generated charge carriers. Instead, we attribute the apparent catalyst poisoning to an increased rate of thermal back reactions, particularly to that of the photochemical oxidation step. While overall back reactions are generally considered in photocatalysis, back reactions of individual steps are largely neglected so far. Our work shows that their inclusion in the reaction scheme is inevitable for the comprehensive modeling of photocatalytic processes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800025

Herein, bimetallic nanoparticles in a metal-organic framework (MOF), i.e., CuPd@ZIF-8 composite, featuring a cubic CuPd core and a porous ZIF-8 shell, have been rationally fabricated for this end. Given the unique physicochemical properties, the Cu nanocubes can not only convert solar energy into heat to accelerate the reaction but also serve as the seed for in situ formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on their external surface to regulate the chemoselectivity of Pd active sites. The additional growth of the MOF shell is helpful to stabilize the CuPd core and offer regioselectivity via the steric hindrance effect. Ammonia borane provides active hydrogen species to significantly boost the hydrogenation and ensure the high selectivity. As a result, the CuPd@MOF exhibits high efficiency, featuring a turnover frequency (TOF, 6799 min(-1)) of 5-10(5) times higher than that in previous reports, and high chemo- and regioselectivity toward the semihydrogenation of alkynes, in the presence of NH3BH3 as a hydrogen source, under visible-light irradiation at ambient temperature.									16	0	0	0	0	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800026

Herein, we employed naturally occurring phytic acid as a renewable precursor to fabricate titanium phosphate (TiP)-supported Ru nanocatalysts with different reduction degrees of RuO2 (Ru/TiP-x, x represents the reduction temperature) by combining ball milling and moltensalt processes. Very interestingly, the obtained Ru/TiP-100 had good catalytic performance for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds at ambient temperature, resulting from the synergistic cooperation of the support (TiP) and the Ru/RuO2 with a suitable proportion of Ru-0 (52%). Various carbonyl compounds could be efficiently converted into the corresponding primary amines with high yields. More importantly, the conversion of other substrates with reducible groups could also be achieved at ambient temperature. Detailed investigations indicated that the partially reduced Ru and the support (TiP) were indispensable. The high activity and selectivity of Ru/TiP-100 catalyst originates from the relatively high acidity and the suitable electron density of metallic Ru-0.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800027		
J	Attias, Ran; Chae, Munseok S.; Dlugatch, Ben; Oliel, Matan; Goffer, Yosef; Aurbach, Doron								The Role of Surface Adsorbed Cl- Complexes in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries								ACS CATALYSIS				10	14			7773	7784		10.1021/acscatal.0c01956				JUL 17 2020	2020	Most electrolyte solutions supporting highly reversible Mg deposition/dissolution contain chlorides. These come as charged or neutral complex species, frequently as Mg-based complex ions, and Lewis-base anions. The electroactive species are usually comprised also of solvent molecules and chlorides as ligands. Numerous studies had shown the critical role of Cl-based species on the electrochemical reaction kinetics, deposition and dissolution overpotentials, electrocrystallization morphology, and many other imperative aspects of the electrochemical responses. Only very few, quite exotic and not fully studied, Cl-free electrolyte solutions have been reported to maintain reversible Mg deposition. Over the years, several compelling theories have been proposed to explain the decisive role of the Cl-containing species on the electrochemical reaction mechanisms during magnesium deposition and dissolution. The role of chlorine-based species in intercalation processes of Mg ions into crystalline hosts was seldom pursued, though. Interestingly, it appears that the Chevrel phase (CP) MgxMo6S8, the main benchmarking Mg intercalation compound, does not intercalate Mg in Cl-free solutions at room temperature (RT). This was established over and again during past decades and recently had been corroborated over a large set of experiments in our lab. Herein, we reveal, via experimental work, that Cl-based species also have a critical role in the electrochemical processes of intercalation. In this work, we studied the function of these during the course of the intercalation process of Mg ions into CP electrodes. We demonstrate that the intercalation process is extremely sluggish, to the point of nonexistent, from Cl-free electrolyte solutions. Quite remarkably, the addition of chlorine-comprising species opens the door to facile magnesium intercalation. On the basis of the numerous experimental results, we suggest a detailed Mg intercalation mechanism into CP. The proposed mechanism emphasizes the importance of the Cl-based species on the charge transfer process across the solid/solution interface. We propose that surface absorbed Cl-containing complexes reduce the activation energy for the interfacial charge transfer stage involving the transport of Mg ions from the solution to the crystalline phase and vice versa. We also propose a relatively simple manner to alleviate the intercalation impediment of Cl-free electrolyte solutions by the cathode's chemical or electrochemical pretreatment. This project has both scientific and applicative significance and may open a hatch for the future development of practical rechargeable Mg batteries (RMBs).									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800028

The activities for D/H exchange Ae(NR2)(2) (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba) were found to be highly active catalysts for between C6D6 and H-2 strongly increase with metal size (Ca < Sr < Ba) and with amide bulk: N(SiMe3)(2) < N(DIPP)(SiiPr(3))< N(SiiPr(3))(2), DIPP = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl. At 120 degrees C and pressures of 10-50 bar, no hydrogenation side-products are produced, and TONs of 205 and TOFs of 268, competitive with those for precious metal catalysts, have been achieved. The reverse H/D exchange between C6H6 and D-2 is even faster by a factor 1.5-2. Substrates also include a range of substituted arenes. Alkyl-substituted aromatic rings are preferably deuterated in acidic benzylic positions, and this tendency increases with the number of alkyl-substituents. Although unactivated (sp(3))C-H units could not be deuterated, the (sp(3))Si-H function in primary, secondary, and tertiary alkylsilanes could be converted. Two different pathways for C6H6/D-2 isotope exchange have been evaluated by DFT calculations: (A) a deprotonation/protonation mechanism and (B) direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Although the exact nature of the catalyst(s) is unclear, the first step is the conversion of Ae(NR2)(2) with D-2 into R(2)NAeD which can aggregate to larger clusters. Energy profiles with model catalysts (iPr(3)Si)(2)NAeD and [(Me3Si)(2)NAeD](2) (Ae = Ca or Ba) show that the direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution is the most likely mechanism for deuteration of arenes. The key to this unusual reaction is the initial formation of a pi-arene center dot center dot center dot Ae complex which is followed by the generation of an intermediate with a Meisenheimer anion. Heavier Ae metal amide complexes are, despite the lack of partially filled d-orbitals for substrate activation, potent catalysts for HIE.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800030

However, standard theoretical approaches based on density functional theory (DFT) suggest complete poisoning of the active sites and are unable to rationalize the experimentally observed dramatic pH dependence and Tafel slopes, which have a critical impact on the electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we overcome these challenges through a rigorous theoretical investigation of FeNC single-atom catalysts using a combination of several state-of-the-art methods: hybrid functionals, continuum solvation, and potential-dependent electrochemical reaction energetics. Our model shows dipole-field interactions in CO2 adsorption to determine the overall activity, which resolves the contentious origin of experimentally observed pH dependence and rationalizes differences in activity and Tafel slopes among different samples in experimental work. A critical conclusion of our study is that single-atom catalysts can be tuned for electrocatalytic activity not only through the traditionally considered binding energies but also through the corresponding surface dipole moment of rate-determining surface intermediates. Our presented methodology paves the way for accurate mechanistic studies as well as the computational catalyst design of general single-atom catalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800034

A critical step for enzymatic and whole-cell production of FDCA from 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) is the transformation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furoic acid (HMFA) into 5-formylfuroic acid (FFA). Here, we establish periplasmic pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) as biocatalytic tools for the oxidation of HMFA, HMF, and 5-formylfurfural (FFF). Further, we identify several amino acid residues including the "lid loop" of the substrate channel as promising targets for future engineering steps toward a fully periplasmic oxidation pathway to FDCA.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800035

Individual decorated fd phages are visualized and simultaneously functionally interrogated by Mt/AFM-SECM microscopy, an in situ local probe correlative imaging technique, combining atomic force (AFM) and electrochemical (SECM) microscopy in a mediator tethered (Mt) configuration. The statistical distribution of catalytic activity across the fd population is resolved, and the correlation between the functional properties of the phages and their actual dimensions is assessed. Moreover, achievement of subparticle resolution allows the enzymatic activity of individual viruses to be spatially mapped, revealing a highly active region located in the middle of the filamentous fd-scaffold. Quantitative modeling shows that this "catalytic hot-spot" arises from the interplay between charge transport by electron hopping between ferrocene moieties along the viral particles and enzymatic catalysis. The developed model also enables complete analysis of GDH kinetics at the single bioscaffold scale, revealing differences in the functional behavior of the biocatalytic viral particles when addressed at the ensemble or at the single-particle scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800036

Using a series of in situ characterizations (XPS, HS-LEIS, DRIFTS, and EXAFS), H-2-TPR, and transient kinetic analysis, two reactive surface oxygen species with different reduction characteristics are identified for catalysts during the reaction. The more abundant and more active surface oxygen species are closely related to the surface hydroxyls located at the Cu-Fe3O4 interfacial regions. A direct correlation of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction rate with both the number and reduction kinetics of the more active surface oxygen intermediates is established.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800037

Inspired by the natural MoFe protein-based enzyme, the nitrogenase, we exploited this electrochemical process with a unique two-dimensional catalyst, namely, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C). The catalyst is synthesized through a chemical vapor deposition method, with a highly orientated (200) facet of the alpha-Mo2C phase. A remarkable Faradaic efficiency as high as 40.2% has been achieved on the (200) faceted alpha-Mo2C during the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Density functional theory calculations confirm that rate-determining steps *NNH2 -> NNH3 and *NH -> *NH2 experience a low energy barrier on the (200) surface following the proton-electron coupled, distal associated mechanism. To protect Mo from leaching during the NRR process, we also grew layers of graphene on top of Mo2C, forming a chemically enduring two-dimensional heterostructured electrode.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800038

In this context, the use of artificial enzymes that are capable of substitute traditional industrial processes by environmental friendly routes is a challenge. Unfortunately, the complete understanding of the catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes remains elusive, thus hampering creation and development of enzymatic proteins. In this paper, the molecular mechanism of the non-natural multistep retro-aldolase reaction catalyzed by a de novo biocatalyst, the RA95.5-5, has been investigated by means of multiscale QM/MM methods. The design of a retro-aldolase presents the difficulty to create an enzyme being able to stabilize several transition states, maintaining low-energy barriers along the overall reaction. The obtained QM/MM free-energy landscape has allowed defining the rate-determining step corresponding to the carbon-carbon bond scission of the substrate, which is in accordance with the experimental data. A deep analysis of the electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the different amino acid residues of the protein, as well as the estimation of the electrostatic potential generated on key atoms of the substrate, has been carried out for the key steps of the reaction. The results, compared with previous computational studies on the most efficient de novo retro-aldolase, the RA95.5-8F, explains the different activities achieved during the directed evolution process and provides insights for future developments of more efficient enzymes.									6	1	0	0	3	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800039

To this end, N-doped carbon composites (NC) are prepared with different N-doping contents and used as supports for Fe particles. We find N-doped carbonaceous materials enable an effective control of the Fe oxidation state via an electronic interaction between Fe and N. This interaction leads to a decrease in the Fe particle size when the N-doping content is increased, as shown by structural characterization of transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction, and to a weakened oxygen affinity of the Fe particles in the presence of N-doped sites, as unveiled by H-2-temperature-programmed reduction measurements with separate N2O and water vapor pretreatments. The weaker oxygen affinity correlates with the excellent long-term stability of Fe/NC catalysts during the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived m-cresol to form valuable aromatic products, whereas obvious oxidative deactivation is observed for Fe/C. An investigation of the surface nitrogen composition of all N-doped samples shows that their deactivation rate constants are closely related to the nitrogen content anchoring Fe into the carbon architecture, which indicates unambiguously that embedding nitrogen into the carbon skeleton (mainly including pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen functional groups) plays a critical role in stabilizing Fe, while amino-N is inclined to suffering from wastage during the hydrodeoxygenation reaction. These results are further confirmed computationally through an electronic analysis of Fe-N complexes embedded into graphene, showing that skeletal nitrogen sites shield Fe from oxidation relative to bare carbon or aminic nitrogen.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800040

Details of the promotion mechanism established on atomic precise identification upon the active sites structure as well as the electronic status is seldomly reported yet. In the present work, we report the direct identification of valence status and coordination configuration of ZrO2 promoter additive over the cobalt-based FTS catalysts under a wide range of Zr/Co molar ratios from 0.12 to 1.5. Evidences from multiple technologies, including in situ/ex situ atomic resolution STEM imaging, EDS elemental mapping, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), as well as physicochemical analyses (in situ XRD, CO chemisorption, CO temperature-programmed surface reaction, etc.) disclose that the ZrO2 promoter presents as single-site dispersion on the surface of Co nanopartides (NPs) and the SiC support at low content, plays as the real active site to promote CO dissociation at the CoZrO2 interface. While at high ZrO2 content (Zr/Co molar ratio of 1.0), Zr species on the SiC support turns to nucleate to form an amorphous coating, whereas those on the Co NPs surface maintain monodispersion. When further increasing the ZrO2 content (Zr/Co molar ratio up to 1.5), cobalt NPs start to be encapsulated by ZrO2 coating, leading to the decline of FTS activity. The in situ EELS analysis and density functional theory calculations disdose that the Zr atom tends to bind at the Co NPs surface rather than embed into the lattice meanwhile a charge transfer from Zr species to Co NPs occurs, which facilitates the stronger interaction between Zr and cobalt and thus enhances the adsorption with the H-2 molecule as well as the CO dissociation. It thus offers enhanced catalytic activity and long-chain hydrocarbon selectivity during the FTS reaction.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800041

A catalytic process that converts NO2- to less harmful products has been proven to be an effective strategy for NO2- removal. Most previous studies, however, targeted selectivity toward N-2 using Pd catalysts, which severely limits the potential for the recovery of value-added byproducts from the catalytic process. Here, we report experimental and theoretical evidence that both Ir and CuxIr(100-x) nanoparticles possess near 100% NH3 selectivity for NO2- reduction compared to the <1% NH3 selectivity achieved by nano-Pd.

In this regard, irradiated TiO2, suspensions are simple and suitable systems to highlight some mechanisms of general validity in the aforementioned research fields. In this work the spin-trapping technique has allowed highlighting the concurrent action of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals toward bromide ions. In fact, hydroxyl radicals oxidize bromide ions to bromine atoms, which in turn can be reduced back to bromide ions by superoxide radicals. The results suggest that this relay mechanism, mainly based on secondary redox products (such as reactive oxygen species, ROS) rather than on direct interfacial electron transfer, is responsible for the generally observed constant concentration of bromide ions in irradiated TiO2 suspensions. The presence of nitrate ions in the system significantly alters this equilibrium. In fact, nitrate radicals generated by hole-induced oxidation of nitrate ions selectively oxidize bromide ions to elemental bromine even under anoxic conditions, but in the presence of bromate as an opportune electron scavenger. This result not only reveals the importance of nitrate radicals toward the photocatalytic production of elemental bromine but also confirms the active role of nitrate ions in irradiated photocatalytic suspensions.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800044

Biocatalytic synthesis of 2-ketoacids starting from L-amino acids would be highly desirable because the substrates are readily available from biomass feedstock. Here, we report bioinformatic exploration of a series of aminotransferases (ATs) to achieve the desired conversion. Thermodynamic control was achieved by coupling an L-glutamate oxidation reaction in the cascade for the recycling of the amine acceptor. These enzymes were able to convert a majority of proteinogenic amino acids into the corresponding 2-ketoacids with high conversion (up to 99%) extendable, and one-pot two-step processes were established for the synthesis of D-amino acids and N-methylated amino acids, achieving great overall conversion (up to 99%) and high ee values (>99%).

Application to an Oxygen Evolution Catalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	14			7958	7967		10.1021/acscatal.0c02532				JUL 17 2020	2020	Proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) catalysts are investigated in the framework of cyclic voltammetry (CV). We analyze heterogeneous catalysts and provide a detailed kinetic analysis of the various responses expected in the case of a PCET catalyst following either stepwise or concerted pathways. Both buffered solution and nonbuffered aqueous media are considered. In the first case, we show that, besides possible limitation by buffer diffusion, the PCET sequence may be rate-limiting. CV wave shape, position, and intensity are discussed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic penalties associated with each mechanism. When water is the proton acceptor in aqueous solution, diffusion of hydronium ions away from the electrode surface is a key parameter, and we show that, for stepwise processes, the equilibrated PCET is not the optimal catalytic response. Finally, we illustrate this formal analysis with an electrodeposited cobalt oxide behaving as a PCET catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in phosphate buffer. The PCET is at equilibrium, and the rate-determining step is a chemical step, presumably O-O bond formation, but the CV is controlled by buffer diffusion in the investigated conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800049

By the combination of Pd(PPh3)(4) and 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthalene (binap), a variety of functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkynes, aliphatic alkynes, propargylamines, and propargyl ethers, could be leveraged to provide a wide array of alpha-acrylic acids in high yields with high regioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies revealed that this reaction proceeded via the cyclopalladation process of alkynes and carbon dioxide in the presence of binap to generate a five-membered palladalactone intermediate and enabled the formation of Markovnikov adducts. Moreover, this strategy provided an effective method for the late-stage functionalization of alkyne-containing complicated molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800050

Both species present major environmental challenges; NO2- is also highly toxic to humans. Available technologies for the removal of NO3- and NO2- from potable water are hampered by a number of issues, which limit their widespread usage. Catalytic degradation of NO3- and NO2- is a potentially disruptive technology. However, the high cost of palladium metal required for this process is a significant economic barrier. Herein, we report the synthesis of scalable catalyst materials based on randomly alloyed palladium-silver nanoparticles. These catalysts significantly lower the overall catalyst cost and simultaneously achieve a 3.4-times increase in the catalytic activity for NO2- hydrogenative reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that alloying Pd with Ag creates more favorable surface binding sites, which is the origin of the increased catalytic activity. The catalysts are also highly selective toward the production of nitrogen gas over ammonia.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800051

We combine the electrochemical analysis with the quantitative analysis of cobalt content using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, transient behavior analysis using in operando XANES electrochemical analysis, and structural analysis using cryogenic X-ray absorption spectroscopy to show that three distinct behavioral regimes exist. Each behavioral regime suffers from a degree of corrosion, but both self-healing and self-repair mechanisms are capable of partially stabilizing the cobalt content within the catalyst film. However, even if the absolute cobalt content of the film is fully stabilized, the catalytic behavior of the film degrades over time. This behavior is attributed to observed structural evolution of the material, where mid- and long-range structural order increases during operation. The increased structural order appears independent of whether self-healing or self-repair mechanisms are activated and results in fundamental changes in the catalytic behavior, observable as decreased turnover frequency and increased Tafel slopes. These results reveal that the cobalt content or electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst films can be stabilized by controlling the applied voltage or solution composition, but simultaneous stabilization of both is not currently possible.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800052

Oxide-derived Cu catalysts exhibit a remarkable selectivity toward multicarbon products for the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR), but the exact role of the oxide remains elusive for explaining the performance enhancements. Here, we used operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with simultaneous measurements of the catalyst activity and selectivity by gas chromatography (GC) to study the relationship between oxidation states of Cu-based catalysts and the activity for ethylene (C2H4) production in a CO gas-fed cell. By utilizing a custom-built XAS cell, oxidation states of Cu catalysts can be probed in device-relevant settings and under high current densities (>80 mA cm(-2)) for the CORR. By employing an electrochemical oxidation process, we found that the Cu oxidation states and specific ion species do not correlate with C2H4 production. The difference in the CORR activity is also investigated in relation to electrochemical surface area (ECSA) changes. While the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is positively correlated to the ECSA changes, the increased C2H4 activity is not proportional to the ECSA. Ex situ characterization from microscopic techniques suggests that the changes in the C2H4 activity and selectivity may arise from a morphological transformation that evolves into a more active structure. These comprehensive results give rise to the development of a cell regeneration method that can restore the performance of the Cu catalyst without cell disassembly. Our study establishes a basis for the rational design of highly active electrocatalysts for broad-range reactions in a gas-fed device.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800053

The Cu2L21 < Cu2L22 < Cu2L23 structure-reactivity trend puts a spotlight on the electron-deficient core of Cu2L23 that exhibits the highest SOD (log k(cat) (O-2(center dot-)) = 7.55) and CAT-like (k(H2O2) = 0.66 M(-1)s(-1)) performance.

Most topical classes of aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl bromides were found to efficiently react with a variety of internal conjugated alkenes. This protocol set up a platform toward diverse alpha-arylated 1,6-dicarbonyl frameworks found in natural products and drugs, which are still highly challenging targets in traditional alpha-arylation protocols because of competitive selectivity of enolation. A removable directing group, gram-scale reaction, and modification of complex molecules have additionally demonstrated that the anti-Michael reductive Heck reaction is a powerful complementary strategy to the classical alpha-arylation approaches.

PatG and related dual-action proteases from cyanobactin biosynthesis are responsible for cleaving off the C-terminal recognition sequence and macrocyclizing the substrate to provide cyclic peptides. This reaction has found use in the enzymatic synthesis of diverse macrocycles. However, these enzymes function best on substrates that terminate with the nonproteinogenic thiazole/thiazoline residue, complicating synthetic strategies. Here, we biochemically characterize an additional class of PatG-like macrocyclases that natively use proline, obviating the necessity of additional chemical or biochemical steps. We experimentally define the biochemical steps involved in synthesizing the widespread prenylagaramide-like natural products, including macrocyclization and prenylation. Using saturation mutagenesis, we show that macrocyclase PagG and prenyltransferase PagF are highly promiscuous, producing a library of more than 100 cyclic peptides and their prenylated derivatives in vitro. By comparing our results to known cyanobactin macrocyclases, we catalog a series of enzymes from this family that should synthesize most small macrocycles. Collectively, these data reveal that, by selecting the right cyanobactin macrocyclase, a large array of enzymatically synthesized macrocycles are accessible.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800015	33457065

A vast broad spectrum of applications reflects their high biotechnological importance. The crystal structure of McoA from the hyperthermophilic bacteria Aquifex aeolicus has the most tightly compact and hydrophobic core among its prokaryotic counterparts. A 29-residue long loop enriched in glycines and methionines (Met-loop) close to the active T1 Cu center is not detected in the electron density maps. Accurate prediction of loop structures remains challenging, especially for long segments with sizable conformational space. Therefore, a combination of Rosetta and molecular dynamics simulations with ensemble-based small-angle X-ray scattering analysis was used to probe the conformational landscape of the Met-loop. The results indicate a highly flexible omega-loop, which is nevertheless not random but preferentially follows open-to-close transitions, exposing or occluding the T1 Cu site. Loop-truncated variants maintain wild-type stability and consistently lower and higher catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K-m) for organic and metal substrates, respectively. Our results suggest that the loop transient dynamic equilibrium can exert important switch-like regulatory function, defining a role for Met-rich motifs as dynamic gate-gappers. This work provides insights into the dynamics of Met-rich loops essential to understand the molecular determinants of substrate promiscuity and catalytic rates within multicopper oxidases. We anticipate that engineering the Met-loop structural dynamics will unleash important changes in enzyme function and specificity with impact on their applications.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800017

This rapid assay utilizes the colorimetric changes of a high contrast indicator dye, coumarin 6, to monitor the photo-induced electron transfer from a sacrificial amine donor to the metal complex excited state. The resulting [Ir(C boolean AND N)(2) (N boolean AND N)](0) can then reduce an aryl bromide to form the highly reactive aryl radical intermediate. The rate of this reaction is dictated by the molecular structure of both coordinating ligands. Relative reaction rate constants determined via this method correlated closely with F-19 NMR measurements obtained using a fluorinated substrate. A simple model that expresses the rate constant as a product of a single "strength" parameter assigned to each of the 72 ligands can well account for the 1152 measured rate constants. The best performing complexes exhibit much higher reactivity than the benchmark photocatalysts commonly used in photoredox transformations. The catalysts were also successfully tested for their chemoselectivity. The developed screening methodology can enable generation of the large data sets needed to use modern data science to extract structure-activity relationships.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800001

The intimate relation between the kinetics network of the reaction, catalyst deactivation kinetics, and residence time distribution is analyzed. The question is addressed why the deactivation of the alkylation reaction in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is slow compared to that in a tubular plug flow reactor (PFR). Conditions are derived where such differences will be minimum and maximum. In the reaction regime of high alkylate selectivity, linear and quadratic power law kinetics equations in propylene concentration can be deduced from microkinetics. They are used to derive analytical expressions of deactivation times for CSTR and PFR. The theoretical power law kinetics equations can be related to previously established empirical rate equations of catalyst deactivation. We show that, in the CSTR, the self-alkylation reaction path contributes substantially to the deactivation time. In the self-alkylation reaction, alkylate is formed by reaction of the isobutene reaction intermediate and isobutane. Catalysts of high proton strength can benefit catalyst deactivation times by suppressing the carbenium ion deprotonation reaction that produces alkenes as isobutene. In the PFR, selective alkylate formation occurs only when the reaction occurs in a reaction zone of the catalyst bed. Deactivation is faster than in CSTR because of the reactant profile in the reaction zone. This reaction zone has restricted mobility due to the fast deactivation of reactive protons located behind the reaction zone by alkenes formed by nonselective reactions in the reaction zone. In PFR, as long as the reaction is limited to an immobile reaction zone, deactivation time is independent of reaction site density and contact time. Contact time dependence arises when the reaction zone is mobile. Overall deactivation time then depends strongly on the degree of deactivation of the protons behind the reaction zone.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800002

Perovskites are known as typical total combustion catalysts in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The fundamental question that we investigate here is whether surface modifications of perovskites can lead to the formation of valuable reaction products in alkane oxidation. We studied the effect of segregated two-dimensional surface nanostructures on selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Manganese-based perovskites AMnO(3) (A = La, Sm) were prepared by combustion and hydrothermal synthesis. Bulk and surface structures were investigated by X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), multiwavelength Raman, and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) in combination with near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Surface oxygen species responsible for C-H activation were distinguished by AP-XPS on the basis of a rigorous in situ analysis of the O is spectra recorded under a broad range of reaction conditions. Signals at 529.2, 530.1, 530.9, 531.2, and 531.8 eV were attributed to lattice O, defect-affected O, surface O, oxygen in carbonates, and hydroxyl groups, respectively. Operando AP-XPS revealed critical surface features, which occur under catalyst operation. The catalyst performance depends on the synthesis technique and the reaction conditions. In presence of a two-dimensional MnOx surface phase, addition of steam to the feed resulted in an increase in selectivity to the partial oxidation product propene to practically relevant values. The selectivity increase is related to the presence of Mn in a low oxidation state (2+/3+), an increased concentration of hydroxyl groups, and a higher abundance of adsorbed activated oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The surface analysis of a working catalyst highlights the importance of the termination layer of polycrystalline perovskites as a genuine property implemented by catalyst preparation. Such a termination layer controls the chemical properties and reactivity of perovskites. The information provides input for the development of realistic models that can be used by theory to predict functional properties.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800003

Recently, applications of machine-learning (ML) algorithms involving catalysis have begun to appear with increasing frequency, as they constitute an attractive pathway both for discovering prospective species and identifying trends surrounding catalytic behavior, principally because the number of potential catalysts that can be examined greatly exceeds those found in more traditional experimental or theoretical approaches. Here, we harness a data-driven approach powered by ML in tandem with molecular volcano plots to estimate the activity of over 143,000 homogeneous nickel catalysts bearing phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene ligands for the reductive C(sp(2))-O cleavage reaction in aryl ether compounds, an important step in the degradation of biomass (lignin) into industrially useful feedstock chemicals. Our computational workflow reveals that a vast majority of Ni-phosphine and Ni-carbene catalysts are not ideally tuned to facilitate this reaction. An analysis of those species identified as being the most promising uncovers a clear catalytic design strategy that can be exploited in an experimental setting to enhance the rate of reductive C(sp(2))-O cleavage of aryl ether compounds.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800004

In a differential bubble column reactor, the apparent activation energy of the molten salt decreases from 301 kJ/mol for the eutectic NaCl-KCl to 171 kJ/mol for 3 wt % of iron-added as FeCl3. The solid carbon produced in the iron-containing salt mixture has a graphitic structure which is distinct from the more disordered carbon produced in the iron-free eutectic, suggesting a different solid carbon formation pathway. Results from H-D exchange investigations are consistent with a different reaction pathway for methane pyrolysis in the iron-containing NaCl-KCl melt than in the melt without Fe. The activity of the salt mixture was stable for over 50 h, producing molecular hydrogen and separable solid carbon. It is likely that the activity is due to the presence of Fe in molecular ions stabilized in the NaCl-KCl melt that facilitate the C-H bond activation in methane.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800005

This contribution addresses electrocatalytic properties of Ni-based catalysts in reactions of fuel oxidation in alkaline media. It first details the electrochemical behavior of Ni in alkaline media and approaches to determine the active surface area of Ni electrodes. Second, the electrocatalytic activities of Ni-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction are described (an endeavor for the development of anion exchange membrane fuel cells), along with a detailed analysis of the strategies put forward to improve them. It is notably shown that the state of Ni surface (oxidized or reduced) largely determines its electrocatalytic activity. This state of the surface also conveys a pivotal importance regarding the activity of Ni for the oxidation of complex fuels (borohydride, boranes, and hydrazine). Finally, emphasis is made on the durability of Ni-based catalysts in alkaline environments. It is shown that, in such media, the material durability of Ni-based electrodes can be high, but this does not necessarily warrant stable electrocatalytic activity, because of possible deactivation following surface oxide or bulk hydride formation in operation.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800006

Based on the composition of the active site cofactor, the monometallic [Fe]-hydrogenase is distinguished from the bimetallic [NiFe]- or [FeFe]-hydrogenase. The latter has been reported with particularly high turnover activities for both H-2 release and H-2 oxidation, notably at neutral pH, ambient temperatures, and negligible electric overpotential. Due to these properties, [FeFe]-hydrogenase represents the "gold standard" in enzymatic hydrogen turnover. Understanding hydrogenase chemistry is crucial for the design of transition metal complexes that serve as potentially sustainable proton reduction or H-2 oxidation catalysts, e.g., in electrolytic devices or fuel cells. However, even 20 years after the crystal structures of [FeFe]-hydrogenase have been published, several aspects of biological hydrogen turnover are heatedly discussed. In this perspective, we give an overview on how the diversity of naturally occurring and artificially prepared, semisynthetic [FeFe]-hydrogenases deepens our understanding of hydrogenase chemistry. In parallel, we cover recent results from biophysical techniques that go beyond the scope of conventional X-ray diffraction, EPR, and FTIR spectroscopy. Taking into account both proton transfer and electron transfer as well as the notorious sensitivity of [FeFe]-hydrogenase toward carbon monoxide, the discussion further touches upon the molecular proceedings of biological hydrogen turnover.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800007

The focus is on 1D and 2D nanomaterials, starting with carbon nanotubes, through graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides to black phosphorus, and closing the circle with graphene in 3D-printed materials. Through these examples, we show that detailed materials characterization is paramount prior to assigning catalytic properties to specific functionality. We show that while metallic impurities in nanocarbons and black phosphorus are often a source of perceived electrocatalysis of these materials, the different phase and valency impurities are often sources of electrocatalysis in transition metal dichalcogenides. These impurities should not be viewed negatively because if their amount is controlled, then they become dopants and can be beneficial for the intended applications of these nanomaterials.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800008

The coordination environments provided by the hemilabile amidate ligands were studied to reveal their spatial and electronic influence on the structures and energies of intermediates and transition states. Several factors contribute to the unique regioselectivity of this catalytic system, including orbital interactions, ligand coordination modes, and steric repulsion. The turnover-limiting step was found to be substrate-dependent. Experimental evidence was obtained to further test computationally generated hypotheses. These investigations show that the bis(amidate) Ti catalytic system's high regioselective performance can be attributed to ligand hemilability, which promotes metal-ligand cooperativity in the reaction mechanism.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800010

We report herein the achiral (CpIr)-Ir-x(IH)-catalyzed enantioselective C-H amidation of ferrocenes. Crucial to the high enantioselectivity is the use of a chiral carboxylic acid ligand derived from tert-leucine via Pd(II)-catalyzed gamma-C(sp(3))-H arylation and a sterically more hindered (CpIr)-Ir-x(III) catalyst. This reaction proceeds smoothly under very mild conditions (0 degrees C) and tolerates a wide range of ferrocene carboxamides and dioxazolones, providing the amidation products in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 97.5:2.5 er). This protocol might open the way for achiral (CpIr)-Ir-x(III)-catalyzed asymmetric C-H activation.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800012

Three dimensionally ordered macro-mesoporous (3DOMM) Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 oxide was synthesized by the combined methods of evaporation-induced interfacial self-assembly (EISA) and colloidal crystal templates (CCT). KMnOx nanoparticles (NPs) possess the natural microporous nanostructure of an octahedral molecular sieve (OMS) with an average size of 0.46 nm. Pt nanoclusters were anchored in situ at the microporous structure of KMnOx NPs and formed Pt-KMnOx active sites. For the OMMM Pt-Pt-KMnOx/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 catalyst, a 3D ordered macroporous (250 nm) structure can enhance contact efficiency between soot and catalysts, and a high specific surface area with contributions from ordered mesopores (5 nm) is beneficial for dispersion of KMnOx NPs and activation of gaseous reactants (O-2 and NO). Meanwhile, a microporous (0.46 nm) structure can anchor K sites and ultrafine Pt nanoclusters. The synergetic effect of ternary K-Mn-Pt components can transform gas reactants to the effective intermediate species and thereafter oxidize the well-dispersed soot particles. The OMMM Pt-KMnOx/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 catalyst possesses high catalytic activity and stability for soot oxidation under the conditions of loose contact: i.e., its TOF value is 2.10 h(-1) at 290 degrees C, which is more than a 4-fold increase over the 3DOMM Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 support (0.47 h(-1)). The architected hierarchical porous structure rationalizes an alternative protocol to improve solid-solid contact and the resulting activity, which can be further applied to other catalysis systems with different catalysts and reactants.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800013

Often, these simulations have relied on atomistic models where a single or a few conformational isomers of the complex are investigated. This Article will show that, for bisphosphine Ni complexes used to forge C-C bonds, a large number of conformers must be studied to provide confidence that the overall model is meaningful. Not only do conformer effects modify particular reaction barriers, but often the lowest barrier reaction pathway proceeds from a conformer that is not the lowest energy conformer. This finding suggests that errors on the order of more than a few kcal/mol could be present in single-conformer studies. The particular reaction pathway and conformer preferences for a series of eight common Ni bisphosphine complexes will provide some guidance as to when the effects of the conformer will be large or small.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800014

The defects mainly result from geo- metrical substitution of distinct Zn secondary building units for Zr counterparts on MTV-UiO-66 crystals. The as-synthesized HO-ZnZrO@C catalyst possesses rich surface oxygen vacancies on ultrafine ZnZrO nanoparticles, which are confined in robust 3D hierarchical carbon frameworks with open and successive channels. The HO-ZnZrO@C and hierarchical H-ZSM-5 tandem catalyst prepared by powder mixing not only affords a selectivity of aromatics up to 73.1% but also suppresses the CH4 selectivity down to 3.4% at a CO conversion of 35.2%. Particularly, we achieve a record-high space-time yield of 0.302 g g(oxide)(-1) h(-1) for methanol-mediated COx hydrogenation to aromatics with high catalytic stability. The 2,6-di-tert-butyl-pyridine adsorption FT-IR results indicate that the powder mixing mode between HO-ZnZrO@C and H-ZSM-5 decreases the number of external Bronsted acid sites on H-ZSM-5, which is beneficial for selective hydrogenation of intermediates to aromatics. Our strategy might open up an avenue for the rational design of highly open hierarchical nanostructures with targeted functionalities for various advanced applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800018

Using off-line, online, and flow-based methods, we observe that zirconium pi-allyl species are unstable in solution and previously unobserved dimethylalane complexes are more stable. The dimethylalane complexes are resistant to further 1-hexene additions, and their formation represents a previously unrecognized pathway for catalyst deactivation.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800020

An Ir(III) complex equipped with a t-butyl cyclopentadienyl ligand and paired with a modified chiral proline enables the highly enantioselective sulfoxide-steered C-H bond activation, providing an efficient and straightforward way to construct sulfur chiral centers. A wide range of dibenzyl sulfoxides and dioxazolones are compatible with this process, giving access to a variety of highly functionalized sulfoxide compounds with synthetically attractive amide substitution groups in good yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, the flexible derivatization of the amidated sulfoxide was elaborated, providing various types of chiral sulfoxide scaffolds that would be potentially useful in asymmetric catalysis as chiral bidentate and tridentate ligands.									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800021

With a minimal amount of alkylaluminum required to activate the catalyst, polymerization kinetics is profoundly affected by the dosage of it. High dosage of alkylaluminum retards the polymerization but does not kill the catalyst. Through a comprehensive characterization on the samples by differential scanning calorimetry, crystallization elution fractionation, thermal gradient interaction chromatography, cross-fractionation chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance, it has been shown that alkylaluminum also alters the short-chain branching distribution (SCBD) of the copolymer but barely affects the total comonomer incorporation. It is proposed that alkylaluminum alters the active species from producing statistical copolymer chains to producing block polymer chains with C4-enriched and C4-scattered segments. It provides an example of a bimetallic structure of active species as well as an approach to tailor SCBD between a statistical copolymer and block copolymer bearing C4-enriched and C4-scattered segments.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800022

However, in real situations, a multitude of VOCs are present simultaneously. Other than the studies with photocatalyst design, the mechanisms of mutual effects between different VOCs and the complex reactions at the pollutants/photocatalyst interface are highly delicate to seek for the optimal routes for their decomposition and mineralization. In this work, a comprehensive analysis was made for the destruction of the formaldehyde (CH2O) and toluene (C7H8) mixture. The synergistic efficiency in the decomposition of the CH2O/C7H8 mixture was first established relative to its individual component. The photocatalytic efficiency was maintained for 8 h on the SnO2 photocatalyst, and the durability of the proposed photocatalyst was stable enough even after 30 days of exposure to air. Direct evidence for the synergistic effect on the destruction of the CH2O/C7H8 mixture composition is hypothesized. Most likely, the addition of CH2O into C7H8 turns out to be the rate-determining step in the ring-opening process to promote the decomposition reaction rates for the mixture. It was revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations that the CH2O addition leads to the generation of o-tolualdehyde as key intermediates, which elevated the adsorption and activation of the aromatic ring. This work may offer better insights into the practicality of photocatalysis technology in decomposition of key gaseous pollutants by endowing the "conventional" SnO2 photocatalyst with novel applications.									26	0	0	0	6	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800023

Here, we use periodic density functional theory and microkinetic modeling to systematically investigate the effect of surface structures on the conversion of furfuryl alcohol (FA). We consider nine surface terminations of Ni with various coordination numbers representing terrace, step, and corner sites. We study three reaction paths for FA conversion on various surfaces and find that the surface structure impacts the adsorption configuration and causes significant differences in selectivity. Barrier height analysis shows that terrace sites favor hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), whereas corner sites favor C-OH bond scission to produce 2-methylfuran (2-MF); step sites show similar barriers for the two reactions. We explain this by identifying three characteristics of the reactant adsorption structures that have a significant effect on selectivity, namely, that a shorter distance between the adsorbed hydrogen atom and the C3 carbon of FA favors hydrogenation to produce THFA, and more negative charge transfer to O-al(co)hol and a longer C-O-al(co)hol bond length favor C-O-al(co)hol bond scission to produce 2-MF. Since the reactions have similar barriers at a step site, microkinetic calculations are employed to calculate the product selectivity on a step site under experimental conditions. At lower temperatures and hiller generalized coordination number ((CN) over bar), THFA is the most favorable product, while the selectivity to 2-MF is higher at lower (CN) over bar and at higher temperature. This work provides guidance for the rational design catalysts to control the product distribution of FA conversion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800024		
J	Zhang, Tong; Lang, Xiuyao; Dong, Anqi; Wan, Xiang; Shan, Gao; Wang, Li; Wang, Linxia; Wang, Weichao								Difference of Oxidation Mechanism between Light C3-C4 Alkane and Alkene over Mullite YMn2O5 Oxides' Catalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				10	13			7269	7282		10.1021/acscatal.0c00703				JUL 2 2020	2020	Revealing the catalytic oxidation mechanism of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is insightful for the development of efficient catalysts. However, because of the complicated interactions and a large number of intermediate species during the reactions, the analysis of the entire reaction mechanism (including the activation modes of reactant molecules and the rate-limiting step) remains a great challenge. Herein, the YMn2O5 mullite catalyst was proposed to demonstrate how to distinguish the deep oxidation difference among C3-C4 alkanes and olefins via combining experiments and theoretical calculations. The YMn2O5 catalyst prepared via the hydrothermal method displayed a superior catalytic behavior with a low T-90 temperature (C3H8 at 250 degrees C; C3H6 , C4H10, and C4H8 less than 200 degrees C) (1000 ppm of C3-C4 and 10% O-2 balanced with He, WHSV = 30 000 mL/g.h). The catalytic activity remained the same after continuous reaction for 100 h at 275 degrees C for each reactant. Overall, the YMn2O5 mullite catalyst exhibits excellent durability with no activity declines for 400 h. Combined with TPD, DRIFTS, XPS, and DFT analysis, surface oxygen species were found to be active for the oxidation. Owing to the difference of the HOMO induced partial charge distributions between alkanes and alkenes, the dehydrogenation of the end-site C-H of propane is the first step prior to the crucial conversion of acrylate over surface labile oxygen in an octahedral ligand unit. For propene oxidation, the C=C double bond is preferentially attacked by two surface oxygen atoms belonging to the octahedral and pyramid ligand units with the crucial step of acetate decomposition. These findings provide insights into the oxide catalyst design toward the complicated VOCs oxidation from a fundamental point of view.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800027

However, this strategy requires developing a support that is electronically conductive, is stable in OER conditions, features a large specific surface area and a porosity adapted to gas-liquid flows. To address these challenges, we synthesized IrOx nanoparticles, supported them on doped SnO2 aerogels (IrOx/doped SnO2), and assessed their electrocatalytic activity toward the OER and their resistance to corrosion in acidic media by means of a flow cell connected to an inductively coupled mass spectrometer (FC-ICP-MS). The FC-ICP-MS results show that the long-term OER activity of IrOx/doped SnO2 aerogels is controlled by the resistance to corrosion of the doping element, and by its concentration in the host SnO2 matrix. In particular, we provide quantitative evidence that Sb-doped SnO2 supports continuously dissolve while Ta-doped or Nb-doped SnO2 supports with appropriate doping concentrations are stable under acidic OER conditions. These results shed fundamental light on the complex equilibrium existing between SnO2 and the doping element oxide. They also open a reliable path to develop highly active and robust IrOx nanocatalysts for OER in acidic media.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800028

This reaction tolerates diverse functionalities, such as C(sp(2))-Cl, fluoro, alkenyl, silyl, ether, thioether, pyrrolyl, and carbazolyl groups including cyclic and acyclic alkyls as well as alkyl-bearing fatty-alcohol and polycyclic-steroid moieties. The demonstrated iron-catalyzed protocol proceeded via either a five-membered or a six-membered metallacycle. Intriguingly, the C-7-alkylated indolines can be readily functionalized into free-NH indolines/indoles and tryptamine derivatives. A detailed mechanistic investigation highlights the participation of an active Fe(I) catalyst and the involvement of a halogen-atom transfer process via a single-electron-based mechanism. Deuterium labeling and kinetics analysis indicate that the C-H metalation of indoline is the probable turnover-limiting step. Overall, the experimental and theoretical studies supported an Fe(I)/Fe(III) pathway for the alkylation reaction comprising the two-step, one-electron oxidative addition of alkyl chloride.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800032

Here we report the synthesis of the IrMo alloy nanocatalyst and its outstanding HOR/HER performances under alkaline media. Specifically, the IrMo0.59 exhibits the highest catalytic activities, which are 5 times higher than that of Ir and commercial Pt/C toward HOR and even a 10-fold enhancement toward HER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that H2O-occupied Mo sites on the surface of IrMo could effectively optimize the free energies of *H2O and *OH, thereby enable IrMo following the so-called bifunctional mechanism both in alkaline HER/HOR electrolysis.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800033

One of these clusters, the D-cluster, is surface-exposed and serves to transfer electrons between CODH and external redox partners. These enzymes tend to be extremely O-2-sensitive and are always manipulated under strictly anaerobic conditions. However, the CODH from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Dv) appears unique: exposure to micromolar concentrations of O-2 on the minutes-time scale only reversibly inhibits the enzyme, and full activity is recovered after reduction. Here, we examine whether this unusual property of Dv CODH results from the nature of its D-cluster, which is a [2Fe-2S] cluster, instead of the [4Fe-4S] cluster observed in all other characterized CODHs. To this aim, we produced and characterized a Dv CODH variant where the [2Fe-2S] D-cluster is replaced with a [4Fe-4S] D-cluster through mutagenesis of the D-cluster-binding sequence motif. We determined the crystal structure of this CODH variant to 1.83-A resolution and confirmed the incorporation of a [4Fe-45] D-cluster. We show that upon long-term O-2-exposure, the [4Fe-4S] Dcluster degrades, whereas the [2Fe-2S] D-cluster remains intact. Crystal structures of the Dv CODH variant exposed to O-2 for increasing periods of time provide snapshots of [4Fe-4S] D-cluster degradation. We further show that the WT enzyme purified under aerobic conditions retains 30% activity relative to a fully anaerobic purification, compared to 10% for the variant, and the WT enzyme loses activity more slowly than the variant upon prolonged aerobic storage. The D-cluster is therefore a key site of irreversible oxidative damage in Dv CODH, and the presence of a [2Fe-2S] D-cluster contributes to the O-2-tolerance of this enzyme. Together, these results relate O-2-sensitivity with the details of the protein structure in this family of enzymes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800034	32655979

We use CO2 or argon (Ar) to saturate the reaction solution and the reactor headspace, and blue light (461 nm) to drive the reaction. When compared to the more expensive Ar, CO2 boosts the conversion rate by creating a Imine Yield reaction intermediate with better electron donor properties.

In order to achieve this, progress in the development of highly active and selective catalysts is fundamental. The combination of bimetallic nanoparticles and reactive support materials offers unique and complex interactions that can be exploited for improved catalyst performance. Here, we report on cobalt-nickel nanoparticles on reducible metal oxides as support material for enhanced performance in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. For this, different cobalt to nickel ratios (Ni/(Ni + Co): 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.0 atom/atom) supported on reducible (TiO2 and Nb2O5) or nonreducible (alpha-Al2O3) oxides were studied. At 1 bar, Co-Ni nanoparticles supported on TiO2 and Nb2O5 showed stable catalytic performance, high activities and remarkably high selectivities for long-chain hydrocarbons (C5+, similar to 80 wt %). In contrast, catalysts supported on alpha-Al2O3 independently of the metal composition showed lower activities, high methane production, and considerable deactivation throughout the experiment. At 20 bar, the combination of cobalt and nickel supported on reducible oxides allowed for 25-50% cobalt substitution by nickel with increased Fischer-Tropsch activity and without sacrificing much C5+ selectivity. STEM-EDX and IR of adsorbed CO pointed to a cobalt enrichment of the nanoparticle's surface and a weaker adsorption of CO in Co-Ni supported on TiO2 and Nb2O5 and not on alpha-Al2O3 , modifying the rate-determining step and the catalytic performance. Overall, we show the strong effect and potential of reducible metal oxides as support materials for bimetallic nanoparticles for enhanced catalytic performance.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800036	32655980

Developing an efficient reduced metal/acidic support with Lewis acidity is the key to facilitating the carbonyl hydrogenation and hydrolysis steps in the hydrogenative ring-rearrangement reaction. Herein, three pure Lewis acidic pyrochlore supports of the form A(2)B(2)O(7) (La2Sn2O7, Y2Sn2O7, and Y-2(Sn0.7Ce0.3)(2)O7-delta) with the same crystal structures and different metals are synthesized. The Lewis acidity and the surface properties of the pyrochlore can be tuned by inserting different kinds of A and B site metals. After impregnation, Pd nanoparticles with appropriate particle sizes are uniformly loaded on the surface of pyrochlore. For the reaction of the furanic aldehydes, all of these pyrochlore-based catalysts exhibit hydrogenation and hydrolysis rates that are both faster than those of traditional support-based catalysts due to the oxygen vacancy and pure Lewis acidity of the support. Among these pyrochlore-based catalysts, Pd/Y2Sn2O7 exhibits activity and selectivity that are higher than those of Pd/La2Sn2O7. Moreover, the Y2Sn2O7-based catalyst partially substituted by Ce3+ ions at the B site is more efficient, with the highest cyclopentanone yield and 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone yield of 95.0% and 92.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst can still maintain an effective activity and stability after 4 runs. This study not only presents an efficient biobased route for the production of cyclopentanone compounds but also focuses on the acid catalytic performance of pyrochlore based on its pure Lewis acidity.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800037

A broad range of linear 1-alkynes, cycloalkyl acetylenes, and aromatic alkynes undergo the hydrosilylation with HSiMe2Ph to afford the corresponding beta-(Z)-vinylsilanes in quantitative yields in short reaction times. The reaction of aliphatic alkynes with HSiEt3 is slower, resulting in a slight decrease of selectivity toward the beta-(Z)-vinylsilane product, which is still greater than 90%. However, a significant selectivity decrease is observed in the hydrosilylation of aromatic alkynes because of the beta-(Z) -> beta-(E) vinylsilane isomerization. Moreover, the hydrosilylation of bulky alkynes, such as t-Bu-C CH or Et3SiC CH, is unselective. Experimental evidence suggests that the carboxylate function plays a key role in the reaction mechanism, which has been validated by means of density functional theory calculations, as well as by mass spectrometry and labeling studies. On the basis of previous results, we propose an ionic outer- sphere mechanism pathway in which the carboxylate fragment acts as a silyl carrier. Namely, the hydrosilylation mechanism entails the heterolytic activation of the hydrosilane assisted by the carboxylate function to give the hydrido intermediate [Cp*RhH{(MeIm)(2)CHCOO-SiR3}]*. The transference of the silylium moiety from the carboxylate to the alkyne results in the formation of a flat beta-silyl carbocation intermediate that undergoes a hydride transfer from the Rh(III) center to generate the vinylsilane product. The outstanding beta-(Z) selectivity results from the minimization of the steric interaction between the silyl moiety and the ligand system in the hydride transfer transition state.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800038

However, thermal annealing usually induces detrimental particle sintering, which greatly offsets the performance enhancement. Although the mechanisms of particle sintering of monometallic Pt catalysts have been well studied, knowledge on the key factors controlling the particle sintering of Pt alloy catalysts is still very poor. Herein, we perform in situ heating (scanning) transmission electron microscopy of carbon-supported low-Pt alloy catalysts (PtFe3, PtCo3, and PtNi3) and reveal that the surface composition plays a key role in both the particle mobility and the coalescence process of the supported low-Pt nanoparticles (NPs) under high temperatures. A surface enrichment of the less-noble transition metals not only induces a faster particle coalescence due to enhanced surface diffusion, but also causes a higher mobility of the NPs on the carbon support due to a strong chemical interaction between the less-noble transition metals and the carbon support. In contrast, the Pt richer surface results in a lower NP mobility as well as slower surface diffusion across contact NPs, which contributes to a higher antisintering capability. Our results suggest that controlling the surface composition, for example, by engineering the elemental growth kinetics during nanoparticle synthesis, is critical for controlling the particle sintering of Pt alloy catalysts during thermal annealing.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800039		
J	Miao, Dengyun; Ding, Yi; Yu, Tie; Li, Jian; Pan, Xiulian; Bao, Xinhe								Selective Synthesis of Benzene, Toluene, and Xylenes from Syngas								ACS CATALYSIS				10	13			7389	7397		10.1021/acscatal.9b05200				JUL 2 2020	2020	Although direct synthesis of aromatics from synthesis gas (syngas) using a bifunctional catalyst composed of metal oxide and zeolite (OX-ZEO) has attracted extensive attention, the selectivity of benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX) remains a challenge. Herein, we show that a hybrid dual bed by packing a zeolite bed below the MnCr-ZSM-5 composite significantly enhances BTX formation. For instance, the BTX fraction in aromatics reaches over 80% when the second bed is beta zeolite and rises to 88% if an ultrastable Y zeolite (USY) is used. Studies show that the zeolite structure of three-dimensional (3D) channels of the 12-membered ring plays an important role in facilitating the BTX formation. Passivation of the external acid sites of zeolites further enhances the BTX selectivity. However, too much silica on the surface of ZSM-5 could narrow the pore opening and is detrimental for the diffusion of BTX, resulting in a lowered BTX selectivity. This hybrid catalyst system provides a promising strategy for direct production of BTX from syngas.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800040

While these applications have been traditionally seen as well-separated areas, recent examples have highlighted the possibility of coupling them. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous production of H-2 and naphthalene removal from aqueous solutions with (unoptimized) photonic efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.33%, respectively, over Pt-TiO2 under simulated sunlight. Photocatalytic and spin-trapping experiments in the presence of a hydroxyl radical and hole scavengers evinced that only the photogenerated holes play a significant role in the oxidation of naphthalene. Isotopic labeling analyses showed that the evolved H2 isotopologues match those of the solvent and that deuterated water (but not deuterated naphthalene) decreases the reaction rate, suggesting its involvement in the rate-determining step. Moreover, the use of TiO2 does not lead to the significant formation of O-18-enriched CO2, suggesting that water is the source of the oxygen atoms. Ultimately, by considering the stable and transient reaction intermediates, we propose a plausible reaction pathway. Our work illustrates that environmental remediation can be effectively coupled to solar fuel production, providing a double purpose to photocatalytic reactions, while the mechanistic insights will be of use for the further development of this strategy.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800041

In this contribution, the particle size effect on CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons over iron-based catalysts was deconvoluted into the effects on primary and secondary reactions. With a particle size range of 2.5-12.9 nm, the overall selectivity of C-2+ hydrocarbons increases continuously, while that of CO decreases with the increasing size. The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and methanation are the main primary reactions and they are more sensitive within a particle size range of 6.1-12.9 nm. The formation of formate species is more favored, and thereby more CH4 is produced as a primary product on larger particles. The secondary process, the further hydrogenation of primary CO to hydrocarbons, is more sensitive within the particle size range of 2.5-9.8 nm, where the geometric effect or ensemble effect on larger particles leads to a higher chain-growth probability. More terrace sites may be conducive for C-C coupling, and the enhanced CO adsorption also benefits the secondary process. These findings highlight the deconvoluted particle size effect on CO2 hydrogenation and provide a dimension for understanding the catalysts in complicated reaction networks.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800044

It contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and catalyzes the blue-light-dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids to generate the corresponding alkane. However, little is known about the catalytic mechanism of FAP, or how light is used to drive enzymatic decarboxylation. Here, we have used a combination of time-resolved and cryogenic trapping UV-visible absorption spectroscopy to characterize a red-shifted flavin intermediate observed in the catalytic cycle of FAP. We show that this intermediate can form below the "glass transition" temperature of proteins, whereas the subsequent decay of the species proceeds only at higher temperatures, implying a role for protein motions in the decay of the intermediate. Solvent isotope effect measurements, combined with analyses of selected site-directed variants of FAP, suggest that the formation of the red-shifted flavin species is directly coupled with hydrogen atom transfer from a nearby active site cysteine residue, yielding the final alkane product. Our study suggests that this cysteine residue forms a thiolate-flavin charge-transfer species, which is assigned as the red-shifted flavin intermediate. Taken together, our data provide insights into light-dependent decarboxylase mechanisms catalyzed by FAP and highlight important considerations in the (re)design of flavin-based photoenzymes.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800011	32905273

Among them, organic hydroperoxide resistance (Ohr) proteins play central roles in the bacterial response to fatty acid peroxides and peroxynitrite (Alegria et al. Ohr Plays a Central Role in Bacterial Responses against Fatty Acid Hydroperoxides and Peroxynitrite. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2017, 114, E132) and present distinct structural and biochemical features in comparison with mammalian Cys-based peroxidases. The molecular events associated with the high reactivity of Ohr enzymes toward hydroperoxides and its reducibility by lipoylated proteins (or dihydrolipoamide) are still elusive. Here, we report six crystallographic structures of two Ohr paralogs from Chromobacterium violaceum, including the complex with dihydrolipoamide. Comparison of these six structures with the other few Ohr structures available in public databases revealed conserved features in the active site, such as a hydrophobic collar. Together with classical, hybrid quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and point mutation analyses, we show that Ohr undergoes several structural switches to allow an energetically accessible movement of the loop containing the catalytic Arg, which is stabilized in the closed state when the catalytic Cys is reduced. The structure of Ohr in complex with its substrate (dihydrolipoamide) together with molecular simulations allowed us to characterize the reductive half of the catalytic pathway in detail. Notably, dihydrolipoamide favors Arg-loop closure, thereby assisting enzyme turnover. The conserved physicochemical properties of the Ohr active site and the mechanisms revealed here provide relevant information for the identification of inhibitors with therapeutic potential.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800001

Site-specific cleavage and functionalization of a saturated C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bond via a visible-light-induced radical process have been achieved. The general features of this reaction are as follows. (1) Both linear and cyclic C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bonds with a vicinal arene can be specifically functionalized. (2) One carbon is converted into a ketone, and another can be tunably converted into nitrile, peroxide, or halide. (3) The typical conditions include 1.0 mol % of Ru(bpy)(3)Cl-2, 1.0 or 5.0 equiv of Zhdankin reagent, white CFL (24 W), open flask, and room temperature. These reactions offer powerful tools to modify carbon skeletons that are intractable by conventional methods. Good selectivity and functional group tolerance, together with mild and open air conditions, make these transformations valuable and attractive.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800002

Insight from X-ray Raman Scattering								ACS CATALYSIS				10	12			6613	6622		10.1021/acscatal.0c00759				JUN 19 2020	2020	Fe-modified MgAl2O4 makes a surprisingly active catalyst support, likely linked to a structural effect of the Fe incorporation. Two catalyst supports, MgAl(2)O(4 )and MgAl2O4, have been studied in fresh and reduced state to determine the effect of high-temperature H-2 reduction upon ion distribution in the lattices. To this end, an X-ray Raman scattering study has been performed, focusing on the oxygen K edge and magnesium and aluminum L-2,L-3 and iron M(2,3 )soft edges. MgAl(2)O(4 )shows a random cation distribution and only small changes occur at the Mg L-2,L-3 and Al L-2,L-3 edges upon reduction at 1073 K. The main oxygen signal does lose intensity and its simulation points to a lower O covalency and more confined state after reduction. Introducing 8.9 wt % Fe into the spinel pushes Mg towards mostly tetrahedral position in the MgAl2O4 lattice, whereas Fe and Al share the octahedral sites. Concomitant lattice distortion is observable in the O signal. Reduction of MgAl2O4 leads to enhanced distortion visible in the O and Al signals and the presence of 50% Fe2+. Both disorder and reduction lead to partial segregation of MgFeOx from the MgAl2O4 lattice. This combination of distortion and phase restructuring in the Fe-modified MgAl2O4 material facilitates the lattice oxygen mobility and hence its catalytic activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800003

Extending ZSM-5 stability under these conditions was studied using silylation, hydrothermal carbonization, and sequential hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis treatments. Coatings resulting from silylation and hydrothermal carbonization were not hydrothermally stable at temperatures greater than 300 degrees C. In comparison, the coating formed by sequential hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis was thermally stable at temperatures as great as 550 degrees C and hydrothermally stable in the presence of a supercritical water phase at 400 degrees C. The carbon-coated ZSM-5 (termed C-ZSM-5) was studied for stability and activity for dodecane cracking in supercritical water. C-ZSM-5 exhibited similar cracking activity compared with ZSM-5 while retaining more crystallinity and Bronsted acid sites (BAS) density. The C-ZSM-5 failure mechanism is the disruption of the carbon-zeolite interface during use. C-ZSM-5 has the potential for extending zeolite stability in liquid water at more severe conditions than previously examined.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800004

However, typical binary metal-salen complex/ionic salt systems suffer from an unavoidable transesterification reaction, which degrades the polymer backbone and changes the polymer properties. We herein describe the precise synthesis of polythioesters from the copolymerization of cyclic thioanhydrides and epoxides by an intramolecular acid-base cooperative catalysis strategy, which can significantly suppress side reactions. The bifunctional catalyst composed of Lewis acidic Cr-salen complex with a covalently tethered 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4,4,0]dec-5-ene (TBD, a sterically hindered strong Lewis base) successfully suppressed the transesterification reaction even at low concentrations, yielding polythioesters with completely alternating structures, controlled molecular weights, and low dispersities. Mechanistic studies revealed that polymer chain propagation was predominantly proceeded by intramolecular alternating enchainment between the Lewis acid-activated epoxide and the Lewis base-mediated cyclic thioanhydride.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800005

The as-resultant AQ-COF was efficiently utilized as a metal-free heterogeneous catalyst for selective aerobic oxidation of sulfides under visible-light irradiation. Compared with the precedential AQ-COFDMF with spherical particles, the proposed AQ-COF presents a higher photocatalytic activity with high selectivity to sulfoxides and chemical stability. Further characterization techniques revealed that the unique morphology and structure can greatly enhance charge transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus giving rise to the improvement of photocatalytic activity.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800007

It is worth noting that this electrochemical method can not only realize the synthesis of benzo 4,5 imidazo[2,1- a]isoquinolin-6(5H)-one derivatives but also provides a new strategy for generating alkyl radicals from alkylboronic acids.									22	0	0	0	3	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800008

ACS CATALYSIS				10	12			6682	6690		10.1021/acscatal.0c00220				JUN 19 2020	2020	Metal bound isobenzopyrylium species are proposed as reactive intermediates in transition-metal-catalyzed [3 + 2] or [4 + 2] cyclizations of o-alkynylbenzaldehydes (enynals) or o-alkynylarylketones (enynones). Because of their high reactivity, isolation and structural characterization of such intermediates have remained elusive. Herein, we report the isolation of such gold(I)and gold(III)-bound isobenzopyrylium intermediates, and two of them have been characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. When reacting with reaction partners, such as styrene and phenyl acetylene, the Au(I) intermediate exhibited a reaction rate much faster than that of the Au(III) species. A degradation pathway of active Au(III)-carbene intermediate was observed, leading to release of Au(I) species and consequent formation of a dichloride compound. In other related catalytic reactions, the Au(I) intermediate could react well with a range of cyclization partners, whereas the Au(III) intermediate did not work. The above observations indicate that Au(I) species is probably the real catalyst in such gold-catalyzed transformations of o-alkynylbenzaldehydes and o-alkynylarylketones.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800010

The popular oxidant used is molecular O-2, and the alternative soft oxidant, CO2 with better selectivity, is difficult to activate and has been less addressed. It is expected that porous BN with plenty of active edges result in an improved activity, and a clarified reaction mechanism can also guide the rational design of efficient CO2-mediated dehydrogenation (O-2 DH) catalysts. Herein, the hierarchical porous BN (hpBN, 657-785 m(2)/g) with nearly uniform mesopores (similar to 22 nm) and rich exposed edges is derived from an "evaporation-assembly"-like pyrolytic approach. Its high synthetic temperature or reductive atmosphere leads to a suppressed edge -BOx degree as well as a decreased styrene production activity. Combined with the decreased N-H signal below 300 degrees C, enhanced B-O signals, BOC, BOCO, and the carboxylate-like bonds suggested by the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra, the CO2 DH activities and -BOx are found to be correlated. The depressed activity, enhanced C-C bond cleavage, and activity loss of the supported B2O3 catalyst can be attributed to its strong acidity and weak binding. According to the density functional theory calculations and experimental results, the reaction routes are estimated. The O atom of CO2 can be bonded to the exposed B edge of BN; then, the >BO-CO bond cleavage happens along with the alpha/beta-H of EB followed by styrene/CO/>BOH production or with the help of a nearby oxygen radical/OH group in a stepwise manner. It is suggested that the concerted route is more favored, and the coexistence of DDH and ODH might originate from -BOH dehydration or dehydrogenation.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800012

The ion pair generated from alcohol and a catalytic amount of P-4-t-Bu was vital for the successful implementation of this stereoselective glycosylation under mild conditions, producing moderate to good yields. Under reported reaction conditions, 2-nitrogalactals produce alpha-stereoisomers exclusively, while 2-nitroglucal yielded more beta-products. The notable difference between the outcomes was investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) study. In addition, we have synthesized the key intermediate of a mucin-type core-6 glycoconjugate, thus illustrating the synthetic potency of this method.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800013

Application to the Catalysis of Electrochemical Alcohol Oxidation in Water								ACS CATALYSIS				10	12			6716	6725		10.1021/acscatal.0c01195				JUN 19 2020	2020	Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) catalysts are investigated in the framework of cyclic voltammetry (CV). We analyze homogeneous catalysts and provide a detailed formal kinetic analysis of the various responses expected in the case of a PCET catalyst following either stepwise or concerted pathways. Both buffered solution and nonbuffered aqueous media are considered. In the first case we show that, in addition to possible limitation by buffer diffusion, the PCET sequence may be rate limiting. The CV wave shape, position, and intensity are discussed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic penalties associated with each mechanism. In the second case, we show that a nonclassical pseudo-canonical cyclic voltammogram with hysteresis due to hydronium production is obtained for a Nernstian PCET catalyst with water as the proton acceptor. Thermodynamic and kinetic penalties resulting from water-based PCET specific pathways are analyzed. Finally, we use the present analysis to investigate the electrochemical catalysis of alcohol oxidation in water with a PCET catalyst, N-hydroxyphthalimide. We have found that the rate constant for benzyl alcohol oxidation is independent of pH, strongly suggesting a true hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as the ratedetermining step. When water is the proton acceptor to generate the active form of the catalyst, i.e. N-oxyl PINO radical, the catalytic process follows a stepwise PTET pathway whose kinetics partially limits the catalytic current.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800014

We employ a minimal microkinetic model that incorporates the influence of plasma-activation on N-2 dissociation rates to predict NH3 yields into and across the equilibrium-limited regime. NH3 yields are predicted to exceed bulk thermodynamic equilibrium limits on materials that are thermal-rate-limited by N-2 dissociation. In all cases, yields revert to bulk equilibrium at temperatures at which thermal reaction rates exceed plasma-activated ones. Beyond-equilibrium NH3 yields are observed in a packed bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor and exhibit sensitivity to catalytic material choice in a way consistent with model predictions. The approach and results highlight the opportunity to exploit synergies between nonthermal plasmas and catalysts to affect transformations at conditions inaccessible through thermal routes.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800015

Compared with classical offline product analysis, the electrolyte characterization near the electrode favors the formation of aldehydes versus alcohols. When the CO2 reduction takes place in the presence of an aldehyde, the formation of the respective alcohol is enhanced, both in terms of onset potentials and partial current densities. The above imply that aldehydes and alcohols are formed sequentially. All determined products are formed at lower overpotential on oxide-derived copper, indicating that the electrode treatment generates different, more active sites. Overall, the presented methodology based on proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry can complement hard electron ionization by monitoring the transient formation of liquid products under dynamic conditions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800016

Here we report a comparative study of a series of earth-abundant cobalt-based spinel oxide (MCo2O4 , M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) nanostructures as robust electrocatalysts for the glycerol oxidation to selectively produce formic acid. Their intrinsic catalytic activities in alkaline solution follow the sequence of CuCo2O4 > NiCo2O4 > CoCo2O4 > FeCo2O4 > ZnCo2O4 > MnCo2O4 . Using the best-performing CuCo2O4 catalyst directly integrated onto carbon fiber paper electrodes for the bulk electrolysis reaction of glycerol oxidation (pH = 13) at the constant potential of 1.30 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a high selectivity of 80.6% for formic acid production and an overall Faradaic efficiency of 89.1% toward all value-added products were achieved with a high glycerol conversion of 79.7%. Various structural characterization techniques confirm the stability of the CuCo2O4 catalyst after electrochemical testing. These results open up opportunities for studying earth-abundant electrocatalysts for efficient and selective oxidation of glycerol to produce formic acid or other value-added chemicals.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800017

However, the development of facile and controllable routes for obtaining nanostructured TMOS under ambient conditions still remains a significant challenge. Here we report a simple and controllable route to synthesize nanoparticles of tungsten oxysulfides (WOxSy) that exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward HER with outstanding stability. The sulfur-rich tungsten oxysulfides with engineered anionic species can offer multiple functionalities, including abundant active sites and improved conductivity that synergistically contribute to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER The optimized WOxSy, electrocatalyst shows low overpotential of 103 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with a Tafel slope of 54 mV decade' and 5.89 x 10(-2) mA cm(-2) exchange current density. Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations further establish the improved catalytic activity of tungsten oxysulfide (WOxSy), compared to the pristine 1T-WS2, based on the free energy calculations. The present work demonstrates a highly promising approach toward the development of cost-effective, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts to replace precious metals for electrocatalytic hydrogen generation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800018

While Pt typically catalyzes the complete hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes, a catalyst comprising a nominal one monolayer (ML) Pt shell on titanium tungsten nitride cores (Pt/TiWN) is capable of net C2H4 generation under industrial front-end reaction conditions featuring a large excess of C2H4 and H-2. Microcalorimetry measurements are consistent with a change in the Pt electronic structure that decreases C2H4 binding strength, thus increasing partial hydrogenation selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) both indicate broadening of the Pt d-band and concomitant down-shifting of the d-band center. The ability to control shell coverage and core composition opens up extensive opportunities to modulate the electronic and catalytic properties of noble metal-based catalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800019

This aqueous-phase etherification reaction occurs with higher selectivity on H-BEA (95%) than on Amberlyst-15 (76%), H-FAU (64%), H-MFI (88%), and H-MOR (63%) at high conversions (>60%). This selectivity toward EMF is not driven by transport limitations or Bronsted acid site concentrations; instead, a kinetic preference for etherification on BEA leads to such high yields. Nonidealities associated with the liquid-phase reaction are addressed by using UNIFAC-derived activities rather than concentrations, and reaction kinetics measurements indicate that the reaction proceeds on a surface saturated by ethanol with rates that are first order with respect to HMF activity and negative order with respect to ethanol activity. Gas-phase density functional theory calculations are unified with aqueous liquid-phase kinetics measurements by using partial pressures of a hypothetical gas phase calculated from UNIFAC-derived activities. DFT calculations indicate that etherification occurs in a single concerted step-rather than through a two-step sequential pathway-in which HMF is protonated and dehydrated to form a relatively stable methoxyfurfural carbocation (in contrast to ethanol dehydration). This methoxyfurfural carbocation is stabilized by resonance in contrast to ethyl carbocations formed from ethanol protonation and dehydration, and it also leads to the observed high selectivity for cross-etherification (to EMF) vs self-etherification of either HMF or ethanol. This rigorous mechanistic investigation uses gas-phase DFT calculations to offer insights into aqueous-phase catalysis, thereby elucidating an important reaction in biomass upgrading.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800020

The resulting alkylidene loss has been assumed to be irreversible. Yet, by reacting (SIMes)(eta(6)-p-cymene)RuCl2 (1), the p-cymene-stabilized alkylidene-free fragment resulting from loss of propene from Ru-2, with ethylene, we show that the methylidene analogue of GII (GIIm) and other Ru alkylidenes are formed, along with catalytic amounts of propene and butenes, and can be stabilized by tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) at SO degrees C in C6D6. An almost 20-fold increase in activity for ring-closing metathesis of diethyl diallylmalonate (DEDAM) on pretreatment of 1 with ethylene suggests that the reversibility of the alkylidene loss may be used to develop longer-lived metathesis catalysts and processes. Mechanistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the connection between 1 and GIIm involves oxidative coupling of two ethylene molecules to form a key metallacyclopentane intermediate (M49). A 1,2-H shift in M49 gives the methyl-substituted ruthenacyclobutane M303, which, on cycloreversion, liberates propene and GlIm. Alternatively, successive H-shifts starting in M49 may give 1-butene (fast reaction) and 2-butene (slower) with a lower barrier than that of Ru alkylidene. The lower predicted barrier is consistent with butene, especially 1-butene, being the dominating product at the start of the experiments, in particular at lower temperature.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800022

Here, we demonstrate the use of caffeine as a "double-layer dopant" to enhance both the HER and HOR of Pt electrodes in base. HER/HOR rates increase by 5-fold on Pt(111) and are accelerated on Pt(110), Pt(pc), and Pt/C as well. FTIR spectroscopy confirms that caffeine is adsorbed at the Pt surface, forming a self-limiting film through electrochemical deposition. Caffeine films are stable up to 1.0 V vs RHE and are readily regenerated through caffeine deposition during load/potential cycling. The findings presented here both identify a potential catalyst additive that can mitigate high Pt loadings in alkaline fuel cells and electrolyzers while opening the door to molecular engineering of solid/liquid interfaces for energy storage and conversion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800023

Herein, a series of FexMn3-xO4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized, derived from Mn-Fe bimetallic MOFs. The Fe0.35Mn2.65O4 NPs exhibit a NO conversion up to 90% at 180 degrees C in an ultrahigh GHSV of 400 000 h(-1). An efficient Fe-oct-O-M-tet site is revealed, and the formation energy of oxygen vacancy on the Fe-oct-O-M-tet site is the lowest, which is the rate-determining step of NO oxidation. The high NO oxidation activity can trigger the "fast SCR" reaction, thus leading to the boosted NH3-SCR performance. This work provides not only an approach to construct NH3-SCR catalysts with high intrinsic activity but also the potential to resolve industrial challenges related to NO catalytic reduction.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800024

This method involves the intermediacy of carbanions or keteniminates, which are presumably stabilized by the micellar environment rather than being quenched with water. These Pd nanoparticles are thoroughly characterized. Mechanistic studies using P-31 NMR spectroscopy revealed the binding of phosphine ligand with the Pd surface and control experiment confirmed the zero-oxidation state of palladium. The scope of the transformation is demonstrated over 35 examples, including one at 50 g scale.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800026

Here we report on the critical aspect of interconnectivity of multicomponents in hierarchical zeolite catalysts using a combined gravimetric and infrared spectroscopy (AGIR) analysis. The variances of macroscopic diffusion behaviors between the global multicomponent catalyst (indexed as global diffusion time constant) and its zeolitic moiety (indexed as micropore diffusion time constant) are differentiated via simultaneous gravimetric and infrared analysis, respectively. The effectiveness factors correlated with the diffusion time constants show that the nonideal interconnectivity between the zeolitic and nonzeolitic components weakens the full potential of the multicomponent catalyst.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800027

If the product ACE is hydrogenated, IPA is formed again. In this way, IPA serves as a rechargeable electrofuel. In this work, we study the oxidation of IPA at Pt electrodes using several complementary experimental methods, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical real-time mass spectrometry (EC-RTMS), and electrochemical infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (EC-IRRAS), in combination with density functional theory (DFT) to assign the vibrational modes of IPA and ACE. Different types of Pt electrodes are investigated, namely single crystalline Pt(111) surfaces, polycrystalline Pt, and nanostructured tubular Pt electrodes. The onset of the IPA oxidation on the Pt electrodes is observed at 0.3 VIE, yielding ACE with high selectivity. At potentials above 0.9 V-RHE, the formation of Pt oxide inhibits the reaction. The only side reaction observed is the formation of small amounts of CO2. We show that adsorbed ACE is formed at the Pt electrodes poisoning the surface. On nanotubular electrodes with high surface area, ACE stays mainly adsorbed on the surface, and only a small fraction desorbs. These observations suggest that poisoning of the Pt electrode by adsorbed ACE limits the oxidation of IPA.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800028

Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control Determine the Sesquiterpene Reaction Pathways Inside Nanocapsules								ACS CATALYSIS				10	12			6843	6853		10.1021/acscatal.0c00278				JUN 19 2020	2020	Terpene and terpenoid syntheses are challenging tasks because of the required multiple synthetic steps, exact functionalization, and difficult purification that reduce the yields. One of the propitious methods to tackle this problem is the synthesis of terpenes inside nanocapsules. Nanocapsules based on resorcinarene moieties have recently been employed experimentally to generate sesquiterpenes, but the improvement of product distribution control in such nanoreactors is currently challenging due to a lack Thermodynamic of specificity. In the current work, we study the in-capsule reactions employing multiscale & Kinetic Control modeling techniques along with a high-temperature Langevin molecular dynamics simulation protocol as well as the potential of mean force using the umbrella sampling technique. Additionally, we generate a sesquiterpene database with information derived from quantum chemical calculations. Using these methods, we shed light on thermodynamics, kinetics, product selectivity, and the chemical mechanism of sesquiterpene formation inside the resorcinarene-based nanocapsule. We find that, although the capsule produces many of the most stable known sesquiterpenes, several very stable sesquiterpenes are not formed. We ascribe this to reaction mechanisms involving intrinsically high energy secondary cations, which are avoided, even in the capsule. The current reaction modeling approach is expected to aid in the design of synthetic strategies for in-capsule sesquiterpene production.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800029

In microorganisms, the MoFe catalytic protein of nitrogenase is reduced by a transient Fe protein binding and separate hydrolysis of ATP. However, the requirement of 16 ATP molecules by the Fe protein for the 8 electron transfer is an energy-intense caveat to the enzymatic synthesis of NH3 and is challenging from an electrochemical perspective. Thus, we report the redox polymer-based ATP-free mediated electron-transfer system of MoFe nitrogenase using cobaltocene-functionalized poly(allylamine) Cc-PAA), which is able to reduce the MoFe nitrogenase directly with a low redox potential of -0.58 V vs SHE. An efficient immobilization of MoFe nitrogenase via Cc-PAA allowed for the bioelectrocatalytic reduction of N-3(-), NO2-, and N-2 to NH3. Bulk bioelectrosynthetic experiments produced 7 +/- 2 and 30 +/- 5 nmol of NH3 from NO2- and N-3(-) reduction for 30 min, respectively. In addition, biosynthetic N-2 reduction to NH3 was confirmed by N-15(2) labeling experiments with NMR analysis. This mediated electrontransfer approach of the immobilized nitrogenase using the Cc-PAA redox polymer provides a valuable technological basis for scaleup and industrial uses in the future of bioelectrosynthesis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800030

NHC-bound nucleophiles known as Breslow intermediates can be obtained by reacting an NHC catalyst with an aldehyde and will add to carbon-heteroatom or carbon-carbon double bonds. On the other hand, the substitution-type crosscouplings of carbon electrophiles (that is, R-X species) with NHC-bound nucleophiles to generate carbon-carbon bonds have also been demonstrated even though such processes are difficult and less mature at present. This Perspective briefly summarizes the NHC-based catalysis enabling cross-coupling reactions. Three types of systems are examined: anionic, hybrid, and radical catalysis.									55	1	0	0	14	0	55			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800031

The photo/electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted increasing interests recently, providing alternative routes to realize green NH3 synthesis. Despite rapid advances achieved in this most attractive research field, the unsatisfactory conversion efficiency including a low NH3 yield rate, and limited Faradaic efficiency or apparent quantum efficiency still remains as a great challenge. The NRR performance is intrinsically related to the electronic and surface structure of catalysts. Rational design and preparation of advanced catalysts are indispensable to improve the performance (e.g., activity and selectivity) of NRR. In this Review, various strategies for the development of desirable catalysts are comprehensively summarized, mainly containing the defect engineering, structural manipulation, crystallographic tailoring, and interface regulation. State-of-the-art heterogeneous NRR catalysts, prevailing theories and underlying catalytic mechanisms, together with current issues, critical challenges, and perspectives are discussed. It is highly expected that this Review will promote the understanding of recent advances in this area and stimulate greater interests for designing promising NRR catalysts in future.									55	0	0	0	2	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800032

This likely implies the presence of sizable errors in the gas-phase energetics. Here, we take a step closer toward chemical accuracy with a semiempirical method to correct the gas-phase energetics of PBE, PW91, RPBE, and BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation functionals. The proposed two-step method is tested on a data set of 27 gas-phase molecules belonging to the carbon cycle: first, the errors are pinpointed based on formation energies, and second, the respective corrections are sequentially applied to ensure the progressive lowering of the data set's mean and maximum errors. We illustrate the benefits of the method in electrocatalysis by a substantial improvement of the calculated equilibrium and onset potentials for CO2 reduction to CO on Au, Ag, and Cu electrodes. This suggests that fast and systematic gas-phase corrections can be devised to augment the predictive power of computational catalysis models.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800033

The atomic-level morphology of a rough electrode is likely one key factor responsible for its comparatively high catalytic selectivity and activity. However, few methods are capable of probing the atomic-level structure of rough metal electrodes under electrocatalytic conditions. As a result, the nuances in the atomic-level surface morphology that control the catalytic characteristics of these electrodes have remained largely unexplored. Because the C O stretching frequency of atop-bound CO (COatop) depends on the coordination of the underlying metal atom, the IR spectrum of this reaction intermediate on the copper electrode could, in principle, provide structural information about the catalytic surface during electrolysis. However, other effects, such as dynamic dipole coupling, easily obscure the dependence of the frequency on the surface morphology. Further, in the limit of low COatop coverage, where coupling effects are small, the C O stretching frequencies of COatop on Cu(111) and Cu(100) facets are virtually identical. Therefore, on the basis of the C O stretching frequency, it is not straightforward to distinguish between these two ubiquitous surface facets, which exhibit vastly different CO reduction activities. Herein, we show that key features of the atomic-level surface morphology of rough copper electrodes can be inferred from the potential dependence of the line shape of the C O stretching band of COatop. Specifically, we compared two types of rough copper thin-film electrodes that are routinely employed in the context of surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS). We found that copper films that are electrochemically deposited on Si-supported Au films (CuAu-Si) are poor catalysts for the reduction of CO to ethylene in comparison to copper films (Cu-Si) that are electrolessly deposited onto Si crystals. As quantified by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), the onset potential for ethylene is similar to 200 +/- 65 mV more cathodic for CuAu-Si than that for Cu-Si. To reveal the origin of the disparate catalytic properties of Cu-Si and CuAu-Si, we probed the surfaces of the electrodes with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and SEIRAS. The CV characterization suggests that the (111) surface facet predominates on CuAu-Si, whereas the (100) facet is more common on Cu-Si. SEIRAS reveals that the line shape of the C O stretching of COatop is composed of two bands that are attributable to COatop on terrace and defect sites. The different surface structures manifest themselves in the form of starkly different potential dependences of the line shape of the C O stretching mode of COatop on the two types of electrodes. With a simple Boltzmann model that considers the different adsorption energies of COatop on terrace and defect sites, and the resulting COatop populations on terrace and defect sites, we deduced that the observed electrode-specific potential dependence of the line shape is consistent with the presence of different predominant terrace sites on the two types of films.This strategy for assessing the atomic-level morphology is not restricted to SEIRAS but could also be applied to the C O stretching bands recorded with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which is suitable for probing a wide range of rough copper electrodes. Therefore, with this work, we establish the potential dependence of the C O stretching band of COatop as a probe of the atomic-level surface structure of rough metal electrodes under electrochemical conditions. When it is coupled with complementary techniques, this methodology provides essential structural information for further improvement in the reaction selectivity of rough metal electrodes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800034

This direct process eliminates the unnecessary protecting-group manipulations that are required with N-substituted (N-protected) imines and can contribute to the development of green chemistry. Although their use has been limited due to difficulties associated with the nature of N-unsubstituted imines, recently developed catalytic methods enable the use of N-unsubstituted imines as electrophiles in various catalytic addition reactions. To facilitate an understanding of the state of the art development of synthetic methodologies, herein we review recent progress on catalytic addition reactions to N-unsubstituted imines. We begin with an overview of the chemistry of N-unsubstituted imines, followed by a summary of recent progress categorized according to the reaction type.

This is confirmed from rate assessments, detailed kinetic analysis accounting for active site loss, isotopic tracer studies, and detailed spectroscopic characterization. Irrespective of the oxidant's chemical identity, the C2H6 activation cycle occurs via the kinetically relevant C-H bond activation of C2H6 on lattice oxygen of MoOx , forming C2H4 . The concomitant oxidant activation cycle either replenishes the oxygen vacancies or generates reactive oxygen species, which scavenge unwanted carbonaceous debris deposited on catalyst surfaces at contents dictated by the chemical identity of the oxidant and oxygen chemical potential that it exerts. Among the oxidants, O(2 )is the most effective, as it removes coke effectively, leading to essentially no rate decay. CO2 and H2O are alternate soft oxidants, and their use prevents the overoxidation of ethylene, thus resulting in higher ethylene selectivity (80-85%) than using O-2 . CO2 activation is, however, severely restricted kinetically, as evidenced from the reverse water-gas shift reaction that is far away from chemical equilibrium; thus, the generation of reactive oxygen species and their ability to concomitantly oxidize coke are much less effective than those with O-2 oxidant. H2O dissociation is rapid and quasi-equilibrated, but its activation converts a portion of the active lattice oxygen to hydroxy species, reducing the active oxygen centers and lowering C2H6 turnovers. The rates of the C2H6 activation cycle dictate the intrinsic rates, whereas those of the concomitant oxidant activation and carbon removal cycles dictate the surface lattice oxygen density available for catalysis and in turn the extent of rate decay. Consolidating these findings within a generalized mechanistic framework leads to a universal rate expression containing two terms, one accounting for an intrinsic C2H6 activation rate and a second one for the time-dependent rate decay. This universal rate expression captures the kinetic properties of early transition-metal oxides in C2H6 catalysis, irrespective of the chemical identity of the oxidant.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800036

We found that removing PmHS2 N-terminal 80-amino acid residues improved enzyme stability and expression level while retaining its substrate promiscuity. We also identified the reverse glycosylation activities of PmHS2, which complicated its application in size-controlled synthesis of oligosaccharides longer than hexasaccharide. Engineered Delta 80PmHS2 single-function-glycosyltransferase mutants Delta 80PmHS2_D291N (alpha 1-4-GlcNAcT lacking both forward and reverse beta 1-4-GlcAT activities) and Delta 80PmHS2_D569N (beta 1-4-GlcAT lacking both forward and reverse a1-4-GlcNAcT activities) were designed and showed to minimize side product formation. They were successfully used in a sequential one-pot multienzyme (OPME) platform for size-controlled high-yield production of oligosaccharides up to decasaccharide. The study draws attention to the consideration of reverse glycosylation activities of glycosyltransferases, including polysaccharide synthases, when applying them in the synthesis of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. The mutagenesis strategy has the potential to be extended to other multifunctional polysaccharide synthases with reverse glycosylation activities to generate catalysts with improved synthetic efficiency.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900016	33520345

The cavity was found to be responsible for a triple selectivity: (i) the asymmetric shape of the cavity of beta-ICyD induced highly stereoselective cyclizations, (ii) the shape of the interior favored the formation of a six-membered ring in the absence of a nucleophile, and finally, (iii) the encapsulation of the metal inside the cavity disfavored the addition of sterically hindered alcohols. Highly enantioselective and substrate-selective alkoxycyclizations of enynes are therefore promoted by the cavity-based molecular reactor (beta-ICyD)AuCl.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900002

Herein, we report the fabrication of a hollow mesoporous MOF with hollow macroporous core and mesoporous shell, featuring a hierarchical porous structure that allows fast diffusion of reactants. The hollow core and mesoporous shell of the MOF were achieved by an elaborate design of a bimetallic MOF with stability differences in both metal-ligand bonds and spatial distribution via a boosted nucleation process, followed by selective etching treatment. Impressively, the hollow mesoporous MOF greatly enhanced the mass diffusion within the framework, which is demonstrated by the diffusion experiments, the molecular dynamics simulation, and the catalytic reaction by using 4-chlorostyrene as a probe. In addition, the as-prepared hollow mesoporous MOF exhibited superior catalytic performance when utilized as a Pd nanoparticles carrier, compared with solid Pd/MOF and commercial Pd/C catalysts toward benzyl alcohol oxidation.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900003

However, little progress has been made on the improvement of the intrinsic activity of ORR catalysts; consequently, the widespread use of fuel cells is still limited by low energy efficiency. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the fundamentals underlying the ORR on platinumbased catalysts as well as metal-nitrogen-carbon nonprecious metal catalysts. We also report the diporphyrin complexes as promising catalysts with outstanding activity owing to structural advantages. In particular, diporphyrin anthracene (DPA) with optimized ligand coordination has a low barrier to dissociate O-2 molecules at the optimal oxygen adsorption energy region, which might unlock overpotentials of less than 0.2 V.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900004

Diastereoselective sp(3) C-O Bond Formation via Visible Light-Induced, Copper-Catalyzed Cross-Couplings of Glycosyl Bromides with Aliphatic Alcohols								ACS CATALYSIS				10	11			5990	6001		10.1021/acscatal.0c01470				JUN 5 2020	2020	Copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have become one of the most powerful methods for generating carbonheteroatom bonds, an important framework of many organic molecules. However, copper-catalyzed C(sp(3))-O cross-coupling of alkyl halides with alkyl alcohols remains elusive because of the sluggish nature of oxidative addition to copper. To address this challenge, we have developed a catalytic copper system, which overcomes the copper oxidative addition barrier with the aid of visible light and effectively facilitates the cross-couplings of glycosyl bromides with aliphatic alcohols to afford C(sp(3))-O bonds with high levels of diastereoselectivity. Importantly, this catalytic system leads to a mild and efficient method for stereoselective construction of alpha-1,2-cis glycosides, which are of paramount importance, but challenging. In general, stereochemical outcomes in alpha-1,2-cis glycosidic C-O bond-forming processes are unpredictable and dependent on the steric and electronic nature of protecting groups bound to carbohydrate coupling partners. Currently, the most reliable approaches rely on the use of a chiral auxiliary or hydrogen-bond directing group at the C2- and C4-position of carbohydrate electrophiles to control alpha-1,2-cis selectivity. In our approach, earthabundant copper not only acts as a photocatalyst and a bond-forming catalyst, but also enforces the stereocontrolled formation of anomeric C-O bonds. This cross-coupling protocol enables highly diastereoselective access to a wide variety of alpha-1,2-cis-glycosides and biologically relevant alpha-glycan oligosaccharides. Our work provides a foundation for developing new methods for the stereoselective construction of natural and unnatural anomeric carbon(sp(3))-heteroatom bonds.									10	1	0	0	2	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900005	34168901

However, reaching a predictive ability in this direction is extremely challenging. It requires both the ability to predict quantitatively the activation barriers in cases where the structure and sequence are known and the ability to predict the effect of different mutations. In this work, we propose a protocol for predicting reasonable starting structures of mutants of proteins with known structures and for calculating the activation barriers of the generated mutants. Our approach also allows us to use the predicted structures of the generated mutant to predict structures and activation barriers for subsequent set of mutations. This protocol is used to examine the reliability of the in silico directed evolution of Kemp eliminase and haloalkane dehalogenase. We also used the results of single and double mutations as a base for predicting the effect of transition-state stabilization by multiple concurrent mutations. This strategy seems to be useful in creating an activity funnel that provides a qualitative ranking of the catalytic power of different mutants.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900006	34178420

Herein, we report the direct allylic C(sp(3))-H thiolation mediated by visible light photoredox catalysis. The use of in situ-generated thiyl radical from disulfide as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagent and a coupling partner enabled selective cleavage of the allylic C(sp(3))-H bond followed by C(sp(3))-S bond formation. The undesired hydrothiolation, a prevalent reaction from facile thiyl radical addition to olefins, was prevented by the immediate deprotonation of thiol under basic conditions. A wide range of diaryl disulfides and olefins participated in the reaction, producing allyl thioethers with high efficiency. Mechanistic investigations revealed the participation of the photocatalyst as a redox mediator, which was crucial for the transformation of the allyl radical into the allyl cation and further ionic coupling process. Based on the proposed mechanism, a limitation in the synthesis of alkyl allyl sulfide was solved with a rationally designed more reducible unsymmetrical disulfide, which makes the desired catalytic cycle operative.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900007

This work reports a method for the selective functionalization of anilines using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent to promote an acid-catalyzed hydroarylation of olefins. Mechanistic experiments revealed that HFIP both protonates the alkene and selectively enables anilines toward the electrophilic aromatic substitution. This powerful strategy has been applied to the functionalization of the anti-inflammatory mefenamic acid with chemocontrol and regiocontrol.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900008

It is generally accepted now that also in heterogeneous catalytic systems, the reaction is catalyzed by molecular, dissolved Pd(0) complexes. In recent time, the mechanism of leaching and, in particular, the dynamics of dissolution and redeposition of metal species came into the focus of research reports. In this context, the specific approach of this study is the comparison of different solid palladium precatalysts regarding their activity in the Heck reaction and the corresponding relation to the dissolution process of palladium in particular with demanding substrates. The potential correlation of leaching and reaction kinetics has been studied for bromobenzene and chlorobenzene. The contemporaneous determination of the conversion and concentration of palladium in solution and separate temperature-programmed Pd dissolution experiments revealed differing leaching mechanisms comparing supported palladium oxide catalysts with isolated palladium surface complexes.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900009

To gain a fundamental understanding of the Ru promotion effects, we herein performed an in situ spectroscopic study by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)-Auger of working Co/TiO2 catalysts (ca. 12 wt % Co, pure anatase TiO2 phase) promoted with different amounts of Ru (0.1-1.2 wt %). At typical FTS conditions (220 degrees C, 20 bar, H-2/CO = 2), the activity in terms of both metal-time-yield (MTY) and initial turnover frequency (TOF) was maximized for the catalysts promoted with 0.1-0.2 wt % Ru, for which most of the Ru was alloyed with Co in bimetallic nanoparticles. The analysis of Auger electrons evidenced that the lower (apparent) TOF of accessible CoO sites in the absence of Ru and at Ru concentrations beyond 0.2 wt % is bridged to the development, under reaction conditions, of FTS-inactive cobalt carbide (CoCx) and cobalt oxide (CoOx) patches, respectively, at the outermost surface of cobalt crystallites.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900010

The present study demonstrates that a high glycerol conversion (40.9%) and significant dihydroxyacetone (DHA) selectivity (65.1%) can be obtained at 303 K under 1 atm air in a base-free solution during the oxidation of glycerol over a bimetallic catalyst supported on SBA-15 (Pt-Bi/SBA-15). CO chemisorption data and transmission electron microscopy characterization show that Bi was deposited on both the step and terrace sites of the Pt surface and consequently modified the catalytic activity. Kinetic studies revealed that the addition of Bi significantly altered the reaction route such that DHA was produced rather than glyceraldehyde (GLD) during the initial stage of the process. C-13 NMR analysis found that glycerol tended to chelate with Bi atoms via hydroxyl groups (-OH) to modify the stereochemistry of the reactants. Density functional theory calculation confirmed that each of the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol were captured by the bismuth species, and the middle -OH simultaneously interacted with the platinum surface resulting in selective oxidation of glycerol to DHA. Bismuth ions (Bi3+) were also determined to promote the isomerization of GLD to DHA, which improved the DHA selectivity. These experimental and theoretical results together explain the high activity of the Pt-Bi/SBA-15 under moderate conditions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900012

Perhaps the largest hurdle has been gaining experimental insight into the active site of the electrocatalyst used to facilitate this chemistry. Decades of study have clarified that a range of transition-metal oxides have particularly high catalytic activity for the OER. Unfortunately, for virtually all of these materials, metal oxidation and the OER occur at similar potentials. As a result, catalyst surface topography and electronic structure are expected to continuously evolve under reactive conditions. Gaining experimental insight into the OER mechanism on such materials thus requires a tool that allows spatially resolved characterization of the OER activity. In this study, we overcome this formidable experimental challenge using second harmonic microscopy and electrochemical methods to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of OER activity on polycrystalline Au working electrodes. At moderately anodic potentials, we find that the OER activity of the electrode is dominated by <1% of the surface area and that there are two types of active sites. The first is observed at potentials positive of the OER onset and is stable under potential cycling (and thus presumably extends multiple layers into the bulk gold electrode). The second occurs at potentials negative of the OER onset and is removed by potential cycling (suggesting that it involves a structural motif only 1-2 Au layers deep). This type of active site is most easily understood as the catalytically active species (hydrous oxide) in the so-called incipient hydrous oxide/adatom mediator model of electrocatalysis. Combining the ability we demonstrate here to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of OER activity with a systematic program of electrode surface structural modification offers the possibility of creating a generation of OER electrocatalysts with unusually high activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900013	32551180

We report that single Au atoms on Co3O4 (Au-1/Co3O4 single-atom catalysts (SAC)) exhibit excellent activity and stability for CO oxidation and that the activity origin of Au-1/Co3O4 SAC is an active area centered by Au-1 atom with one nearby Co and O atoms (and/or O vacancy). The turnover frequency is 3.1 s-1 at -75 degrees C, to our knowledge, which makes Au-1/Co3O4 SAC one of the most active Au catalysts for CO oxidation. The activity can be maintained after 10 cycles of temperature-programmed reaction from -100 to 300 degrees C or storage in air for 1 year, indicating the high stability of Au-1/Co3O4 SAC. The isotope, in situ DRIFTS, kinetics, and density functional theory (DFT) results further demonstrate that CO2 is produced through two reaction pathways, following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (predominant) and Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms, respectively. The present findings pave the way for better understanding supported metal catalysts.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900014

We have furnished over 30 examples of aminosilane synthesis along with kinetic studies using MeBnNH and MePhSiH2 as coupling partners. The kinetic studies suggest a reversible reaction with silane which generates aminosilane and an Fe-hydride dimer that undergoes rate-limiting protonolysis with amine with N-H bond cleavage in the transition state, consistent with a primary KIE of 2.42(3). The presence of dimers as on-cycle intermediates was analyzed in depth. Beyond this we have explored the substrate scope of phosphinosilane formation which shows a preferential heterodehydrocoupling to give the phosphinosilane with primary and secondary silanes. Silylethers can also be prepared and alcohols that contain alkene functionality do not show any tendency to reduce the double bond.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900015

Here, we investigated the kinetics of water formation (from hydrogen and chemisorbed oxygen) in the confined space at the interface between bilayer (BL) silica and a Ru(0001) support, compared to the reaction on the bare Ru(0001) surface. Ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) experiments were carried out at different temperatures at elevated pressures of H-2 to follow the reaction kinetics. The apparent activation energy at the BL-silica/Ru(0001) interface was found to be 0.38 eV lower than that on bare Ru(0001), consistent with a recent report by Prieto et al. (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2018, 57(28), 8749-8753) carried out at lower H-2 pressures using low-energy electron microscopy. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the rate-limiting step in the direct hydrogenation pathway on the Ru(0001) surface is the first hydrogen addition step (*H + *O <-> *OH). The confinement at the BL-silica/Ru(0001) interface only marginally affects the energy barrier of the first hydrogen addition. Instead, it activates an alternative disproportionation reaction pathway (*H2O + *O <-> 2*OH). On the bare Ru(0001) surface, the disproportionation pathway can only occur at cryogenic temperatures or under high water vapor pressures. However, the presence of the BL-silica increases the desorption barrier for water molecules at the interface. The increased residence time allows trapped water molecules to react with chemisorbed oxygen to produce two *OH per H2O with an activation energy 0.25 eV lower than that of the first hydrogen addition step.

This study presents a cutting-edge strategy combining density functional theory (DFT), catalytic tests complemented with the extensive characterization of a wide range of metal catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Ag, Ir, and Pt), and statistical tools for a computer-assisted investigation of this reaction. The steady-state catalytic tests identified four classes of materials comprising (i) poorly active (<8%) Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, Cu/SiO2, and Ag/SiO2; (ii) Rh/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2, which exhibit intermediate CH3Br selectivity (<60%); (iii) Ir/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2, which display great propensity to CH4 (>50%); and (iv) Ru/SiO2, which exhibits the highest selectivity to CH3Br (up to 96%). In-depth characterization of representative catalysts in fresh and used forms was done by X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, N-2 sorption, temperature-programmed reduction, Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The dimensionality reduction performed on the 272 DFT intermediate adsorption energies using principal component analysis identified two descriptors that, when employed together with the experimental data in a random forest regressor, enabled the understanding of activity and selectivity trends by connecting them to the energy intervals of the descriptors. In addition, a representative analytic model was found using the Bayesian inference. These findings illustrate the exciting opportunities presented by integrated experimental/computational screening and set the fundamental basis for the accelerated discovery of superior hydrodebromination catalysts and beyond.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900018

Oxidative pretreatment at 150 degrees C "collapsed" the clusters' ligand shell, oxidizing the hydrocarbon backbone, but the S remaining on Au acted as poison. Oxidation at 250 degrees C produced bare Au surfaces by removing S which migrated to the support (forming Au+-S), leading to highest activity. During reaction, structural changes occurred via COinduced Au and O-induced S migration to the support. The results reveal the dynamics of nanocluster catalysts and the underlying cluster chemistry.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900019	32551181

Herein, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Boltzmann statistics to describe ensembles of nanoparticles obtaining different morphologies under reaction conditions (temperature and gas-phase chemical potential) and their respective distribution of active sites. We apply our methodology on Rh catalytic nanoparticles, and we address the contribution of metastable nanostructures on the overall CO dissociation catalytic activity. Importantly, we demonstrate how catalytic trends can change when accounting for an ensemble of nanoparticles compared to a single, thermodynamically stable nanoparticle. Thus, our work enlightens the impact of statistical representation of catalyst morphology on modeling structure-sensitive reactions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900020

The electrodes were prepared by magnetron sputtering (MS) in an oblique angle configuration and under various conditions aimed at preparing metallic, oxide, or oxyhydroxide films. Their electrochemical analysis has been complemented with a thorough physicochemical characterization to determine the effect of microstructure, chemical state, bilayer structure, and film thickness on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The maximum electrocatalytic activity was found for the metallic electrode, where analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrated that the active catalytic phase at the surface after its electrochemical conditioning is a kind of oxidized nickel oxide/hydroxide layer with the thickness of a few nanometers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis of these steady-state working electrodes supports that the enhanced performance of the metallic nickel anode vs other chemical states resides in the easier electron transfer through the electrode films and the various interlayers built up during their fabrication and activation. The long-term steady-state operation of the anodes and their efficiency for water splitting was proved in a full-cell AEMWE setup incorporating magnetron-sputtered metallic nickel as the cathode. This work proves that MS is a suitable technique to prepare active, stable, and low-cost electrodes for AEMWE and the capacity of this technique to control the chemical state of the electrocatalytically active layers involved in the OER.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900021

Pyridoxal-Catalyzed Racemization of alpha-Aminoketones Enables the Stereodivergent Synthesis of 1,2-Amino Alcohols Using Ketoreductases								ACS CATALYSIS				10	11			6171	6175		10.1021/acscatal.0c01502				JUN 5 2020	2020	Differentially substituted 1,2-amino alcohols are a prevalent motif in a variety of pharmaceutical and agrochemical molecules. Dynamic kinetic resolutions (DKRs) that involve the asymmetric reduction of alpha-amino ketones are attractive for preparing this motif; however, methods for racemizing the stereogenic alpha-carbon under mild conditions are underdeveloped. Here we report a chemoenzymatic DKR involving ketoreductases (KREDs), in which pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) is used to catalyze racemization of the starting racemic alpha-aminoketone. This strategy enables access to a variety of 1,2-amino alcohols with high levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Using commercially available KREDs, all four possible stereoisomers can be accessed, highlighting a benefit to this approach.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900022

In this study, four types of MnO2 catalysts with crystal phases corresponding to alpha-, beta-,gamma-, and delta-MnO2 were synthesized, and their catalytic properties in HCHO and C6H6 oxidation were studied. alpha- and gamma-MnO2 were found to possess much better activity for C6H6 oxidation than delta- and beta-MnO2 catalysts, whereas delta-MnO2 exhibited the best performance for HCHO oxidation as compared with other types of MnO2. Three kinds of oxygen species were discriminated based on their Mn-O bond strength and reducibility. By quantitatively correlating the amount of specific oxygen species with the reaction rates, the catalytic roles of different oxygen species in HCHO and C6H6 oxidation were clarified. With the assistance of isotopic labeling studies, the participation of oxygen species in C6H6 oxidation-which followed a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism-was illuminated.									29	1	0	0	5	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900023

OXA-48 enzymes are clinically important class D serine beta-lactamases (SBLs) that confer resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems. However, OXA-48 and related enzymes vary widely in their activity toward different substrates: OXA-48 primarily hydrolyzes carbapenems, whereas the OXA-163 variant is a cephalosporinase with minimal carbapenemase activity. The basis of cephalosporinase activity in OXA-163 remains elusive. Here we use QM/MM reaction simulations (umbrella sampling molecular dynamics) to study the breakdown of the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftazidime, a key antibiotic for healthcare-associated infections, by selected OXA-48 variants. Calculated free energy barriers for ceftazidime deacylation correctly capture the differing catalytic efficiencies of the studied enzymes and identify the catalytically competent orientation for bound ceftazidime. Additionally, we show that high flexibility of the Omega loop bordering the active site, a determinant of specificity in many SBLs, is not required for efficient deacylation. Based on our simulations, cephalosporin breakdown in OXA-163 is efficient due to subtle control of active site solvation, which requires a particular orientation of Leu158 in the Omega loop. Our simulations further predict that a single mutation in the OXA-48 beta 5-beta 6 loop (Arg214Ser) will increase the efficiency of ceftazidime deacylation to that of OXA-163. The finding that the hydration of the general base in the active site determines deacylation efficiency is possibly important in other class D beta-lactamases.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900024

In this work, the Cu&Zn dual-metal-modified SSZ-13 zeolite catalyst (Cu&Zn-SSZ-13) was elegantly synthesized in a one-pot (OP) manner, and the prepared material exhibits good NH3-SCR activity. Impressively, Cu&Zn-SSZ-13(OP) has greater hydrothermal stability than Cu-SSZ-13 catalysts prepared by other means. The characterization data (obtained by XPS, H-2-TPR, NH3-TPD and EPR techniques) in this work revealed that the Zn introduced by a one-pot method would not only help optimize and disperse the isolated Cu2+ species, providing good SCR activity, but also form [Zn-OH]-Z, [Cu-O-Zn]-Z, and [Zn-O-Zn]-Z complexes. Further DFT calculations confirm that these complexes are much more stable than single Cu ions under hydrothermal aging, and these Zn-containing species can function as anchors to stabilize the SSZ-13 framework.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900025

Activation energy barriers and elementary reaction rates have been calculated as a function of the hydrogen surface coverage, theta(H), with relevant properties derived from ab initio thermodynamics and kinetic rate estimates. The hydrogen coverage has a very strong effect on the adsorption energy and the second hydrogenation step of ethylene. A relatively low energy barrier favors the dissociation of H-2 on delta-MoC(001) leading to medium H coverages (>0.4 of a monolayer) where the energy barrier for the full hydrogenation of ethylene is already below the corresponding barriers seen on Pt(111) and Pd(111). At a high H coverage of similar to 0.85 of a monolayer, the C2H4 adsorbs at 1 atm and 300 K over a system having as-formed CH3 moiety species, which critically favors the C2H4 second hydrogenation, typically a rate limiting step, by reducing its activation energy to a negligible value of 0.08 eV, significantly lower than the equivalent values of similar to 0.5 eV reported for Pt(111) and Pd(111) catalyst surfaces. The ethane desorption rate is larger than the surface intermediate elementary reaction rates, pointing to its desorption upon formation, closing the catalytic cycle. The present results put delta-MoC under the spotlight as an economic and improved replacement catalyst for Pt and Pd, with significant improvements in enthalpy and activation energy barriers. Here, we provide a detailed study for the C2H4 hydrogenation reaction mechanism over a carbide showing characteristics or features not seen on metal catalysts. These can be exploited when dealing with technical or industrial applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900026

During the reduction process, the NiCo alloy particles undergo elemental segregation with Co migrating toward the center of the catalyst particles and Ni migrating to the outer surfaces. Under DMR conditions, the segregated structure is maintained, thus hinting at the importance of this structure to optimal catalytic functions. Finally, the formation of Ni-rich branches on the surface of the particles is observed during DMR, suggesting that the loss of Ni from the outer shell may play a role in the reduced stability and hence catalyst deactivation. These findings provide insights into the morphological and electronic structural changes that occur in a NiCo-based catalyst during DMR. Further, this study emphasizes the need to study catalysts under operating conditions in order to elucidate material dynamics during the reaction.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900027	32551182

Traditional methods of catalyst preparation such as impregnation or precipitation lead to the formation of relatively large metal nanoparticles (15-30 nm). The design of supported metal catalysts with higher dispersion is expected to result in major rate enhancement in many catalytic reactions. Hereby, we propose an efficient way to significantly increase the dispersion of metal catalysts by disassembling of supported metal nanoparticles using in situ polycondensation of aldehydes produced during dehydrogenation of fatty alcohols. Bulky polymers behave as surfactants, facilitating budding of smaller metal nanoparticles. Subsequent removal of carbon species by oxidative treatments results in smaller isolated metal nanoparticles with the sizes of about 2-7 nm and 3-6 times higher catalytic activity in hydrogenation, amination, and oxidation reactions. This method opens up the possibility of metal redispersion in both freshly prepared and deactivated catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900028

This combined computational and experimental study demonstrates that diarylcarbenes display reactivity characteristics that are more reminiscent of donor/acceptor carbenes. When the reactions are carried out with the chiral dirhodium catalysts Rh-2(S-PTAD)(4) and Rh-2(S-NTTL)(4), highly enantioselective and diastereoselective cyclopropanations can be achieved, forming 1,1,2-triarylcyclopropanes. The reason for this behavior is because the two rings are unable to align in the plane of the rhodium carbene at the same time. The aryl ring aligned in the plane of the carbene behaves as a donor group, whereas the aryl ring aligned orthogonally behaves as an acceptor group.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900029

For the Ni-only phase, water adsorption and intercalation can significantly lower both the surface and interface energies, and even introduce "negative surface energy". Thus, water can exfoliate layers, leading to Fe ion adsorption on inner layers, as demonstrated by ab initio molecular dynamics. These single atoms have been carefully speciated (i.e., initially prepared as Fe2+ and Fe3+) and proton coupled electron transfer between the H2O-Fe and lattice oxygen ions has been observed in all ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which is attributed to the Fe incorporation, since no proton coupled electron transfer occurs under free water conditions. Furthermore, 15 possible oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms near Fe ions show that the main active species corresponds to the Ni2+, which is reduced from Ni3+ via H transfer when a Fe2+ iron adsorbs nearby, and the overpotential can be significantly reduced to 0.23 V.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900031

Regarding semiconductor-based photocatalysts, cadmium sulfide (CdS) materials have received extensive consideration for various photoredox reactions because of their suitable band gap (about 2.4 eV) for visible light response and well-matched band edge stations. In this paper, we begin with a concise discussion of the basic physical properties of CdS materials, including electronic band structures, optical properties, crystallographic structures, and phase transition. Then, the fundamental principles of photocatalytic organic transformations over CdS and the effect of different active species on the selective photoredox process are concisely summarized. In particular, we will highlight the photocatalytic selective organic synthesis application over various CdS-based photocatalysts, including selective reductions, oxidations, and valorization of lignin. Finally, the future perspectives and challenges in the development of efficient CdS-based photocatalytic system toward selective organic synthesis are discussed.

In PEMFCs, small particle sizes of the Pt catalyst are required to increase Pt utilization, which lower costs and also increase Pt dispersion, which itself minimizes O-2 mass transport losses. Reducing the particle size improves both the utilization and dispersion; however, stability of small particle sizes is an issue. Pt dissolution, as one of the major degradation mechanisms of PEMFC catalyst layers, is predicted to depend on the particle size. The particle size cannot be independently varied from loading in commercial Pt/C materials that have been used in numerous studies employing accelerated stability tests (ASTs). Therefore, in the study presented here, the Pt particle diameter was varied from 2 to 10 nm by depositing mass-selected nanoparticles on a flat glassy carbon substrate using magnetron sputtering. This allows exclusive control over particle density (interparticle distance) and particle size, which becomes difficult even with advanced synthetic techniques for applied Pt/C materials. Additionally, effects of the 3D porous support are eliminated. These model systems were subjected to an aggressive AST in order to cause significant Pt dissolution, which was monitored online using the scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The results uncover a previously overlooked phenomenon: two competing trends in dissolution from (1) particle passivation caused by particle sizedependent shifts on oxophilicity and (2) electrochemically active surface area. Therefore, crucial impacts of the particle size on degradation may be overlooked in a variety of electrochemical studies, which compare catalytic materials. Finally, suggestions are given for improved ASTs for dissolution, which provide insights into the intrinsic stability of Pt nanoparticles toward dissolution.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900033

One of the major reasons for drug resistance is the expression of beta-lactamases especially metallo-beta-lactamases such as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) by Gram-negative bacteria. The fungal natural product aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) was found to be a promising inhibitor of NDM-1 to potentiate currently used beta-lactam antibiotics to overcome drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Although several chemical synthesis and chemoenzymatic synthesis approaches to access AMA have been reported, the biosynthesis of AMA was still elusive. Herein, we identified the key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of AMA in Aspergillus oryzae. AMA synthase is a PLP-dependent cysteine synthase homologous protein which utilizes O-acetyl-L-serine/Ophospho-L-serine and L-aspartic acid as its substrates. Remarkably, this enzyme catalyzes two consecutive C-N bond formations to produce AMA efficiently which may be attributed to the spacious substrate-binding pocket. PLP is covalently bound to Lys61 by an internal aldimine from the PLP re face, and the si face of PLP pyridine ring is accessible to the substrates to promote the nucleophilic addition of amino acids to the double bond of the external adiminine and ultimately to generate chiral C-alpha with S configuration. The catalytic mechanism was proposed based on molecular docking and biochemical experiments. In addition, we have further investigated the substrate scope of AMA synthase and identified a variant enzyme which shows promising potential in producing structurally diverse molecules containing the C-N bond.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900034

Here we report that manganese oxide nanorod-supported single-site Ru catalysts are active, selective, and stable for oxidative cyanation of various alcohols to give the corresponding nitriles with molecular oxygen and ammonia as the reactants. The very low amount of Ru (0.1 wt %) with atomic dispersion boosts the catalytic performance of manganese oxides. Experimental and theoretical results show how the Ru sites enhance the ammonia resistance of the catalyst, bolstering its performance in alcohol dehydrogenation and oxygen activation, the key steps in the oxidative cyanation. This investigation demonstrates the high efficiency of a single-site Ru catalyst for nitrile production.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900035

Herein, a comprehensive study on the employed rhodium-cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) catalyst precursor is disclosed. Mechanistic experiments, kinetic studies, and surface-spectroscopic methods revealed supported rhodium(0) nanoparticles (NP) as the active catalytic species. Further studies suggest that CAAC-derived modifiers play a key role in determining the chemoselectivity of the hydrogenation of fluorinated arenes, thus offering an avenue for further tuning of the catalytic properties.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900036	32551183

In this work, we prepared a model MgO-SiO2 catalyst by impregnation of MgO onto an SBA-15 support and used this material to study the reaction kinetics of ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde. The rates of acetaldehyde and ethylene production were measured for ethanol partial pressures ranging from 0.92 to 5.25 kPa. Both rates are fractional order at 723 K, decreasing to nearly zero-order at 648 K. Consistent with the literature for MgO-SiO2 Lebedev catalysts, both basic sites and Lewis acidic sites were observed on this catalyst. The rates of both acetaldehyde and ethylene were inhibited by pyridine but not by 2,6-ditertbutylpyridine, suggesting that both reactions involve not only basic but also Lewis acidic sites. To elucidate the origin of this cooperativity, a microkinetic model was constructed using a recently published mechanism for the Lebedev reaction catalyzed by MgO. The model was fit to our data using four fitting parameters. The fitting suggests that adsorbed ethanol and hydrogen atoms have a weaker bond with mixed-oxide MgO-SiO2 catalysts than with bulk MgO catalysts, which we attribute experimentally to an increase in the number of moderate-strength Mg2+O2- site pairs formed at the expense of strongly basic MgO sites.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900037

Density functional calculations have been carried out to explore the reaction mechanism and the origin of selectivity. The porphyrin ligand was found to be redox noninnocent and accept two electrons and one proton, while the ferrous ion keeps its oxidation state as +2 during the reduction. The Fe-II-porphyrin diradical intermediate then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2, coupled with two electron transfers from the porphyrin ligand to the CO2 moiety. Subsequently, an intramolecular proton transfer takes place from the porphyrin nitrogen to the carboxylate oxygen, affording an Fe-II-COOH intermediate. An alternative pathway to form the critical Fe-II-COOH intermediate, involving the attack on CO2 by an unprotonated two-electron reduced Fe-II-porphyrin diradical species followed by protonation, was found to be possible as well. Finally, proton transfer from the carbonic acid in the aqueous solution to the hydroxyl moiety results in the cleavage of the C-O bond and the production of a CO molecule. The formation of an Fe-II-hydride species, a critical intermediate for the production of H-2 and formic acid, was found to be kinetically much less favorable than the protonation of the porphyrin nitrogen, even though it is thermodynamically more favorable. The prevention of this metal-hydride formation pathway explains why this catalyst is highly selective for the reduction of CO2 in aqueous solution.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900038

We here propose a method that is able to automatically generate a catalytic reaction network and identify the preferred reaction pathway with determined uncertainty. Taking syngas conversion to ethanol on Rh(111) as an example, a reaction network consisting of 95 elementary steps was generated. Using energies calculated with an ensemble of 2000 functionals, the occurrence frequency of different ethanol formation pathways was obtained through pruning of the reaction network with mean-field microkinetic modeling. We found that CHCO is the most important reaction intermediate for ethanol formation with the highest confidence, even at varied temperatures and pressures. The transition state of CH3CH2O hydrogenation, i.e. CH3CH2O-H, possesses the highest possibility to be rate-controlling. CO has the highest possibility to be the surface dominant species at all the temperatures and pressures considered. The method developed in the current work substantially reduces the complexity of identifying the mechanism of catalytic reactions and shows great potential in expediting future catalyst design.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900039

However, the development of robust heterogeneous catalysts with high activity and stability has been a challenge. We herein report a synthesis of hollow nanostructured composite consisting of PdAg nanoparticles (NPs) and aminopolymers, poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), confined in hollow mesoporous organosilica spheres (HMOSs), which act as an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 to formate. The catalyst exhibits high formate yield with a turnover number (TON) of over 2700 and 13 700 for 22 and 110 h, respectively, under mild reaction conditions (total 2.0 MPa, 100 degrees C), which outperforms the conventional supported Pd catalysts because of the cooperative action of PEI and PdAg NPs confined in a nanospace to directly capture, activate, and hydrogenate the CO2 molecule. The catalyst is reusable over multiple cycles with high activity because of the protective effect and alkali-tolerant property of HMOSs. This study offers a strategy for the design and development of an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 conversion.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900040

Nevertheless, there are many short-comings, such as high photogenerated electron-hole recombination rate and poor light stability, that hinder the further development of artificial photosynthesis. Thus, inspired by the natural photosynthesis of green plants, a 3D spatial reticulation all-solid-state artificial direct Z-scheme photocatalyst is manufactured to solve the above problems by using a graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) shell encapsulating Cu2O nanowire arrays/Cu mesh (g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs/CM). Consequently, the CH3OH formation rate and the selectivity of g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs reached 22.6 ppm cm(-2) h(-1) and 94.9% under solar light irradiation, respectively. More importantly, the material retained 94.7% of its primary catalytic activity after 60 h test (ten reaction cycles). It is attributed to the protective g-C3N4 layer and the synergetic effect between interface carrier separation modulation and relatively short radial transmission channel design. This strategy provides unique insights into the design and preparation of efficient practical photocatalysts for energy synthesis.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900041

Currently, they belong to the state of the art catalysts owing to their environmental compatibility, high activity, propene selectivity, and durability. However, the structure-activity-selectivity relationships are still not appropriately understood. To close such gaps, we focused on elucidating the role of surface defects (coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zr-cus) sites) and supported Rh nanoparticles (NPs) in Rh/ZrO2 for activity and selectivity in the PDH reaction. Relevant physicochemical properties were analyzed by complementary experimental techniques, while details of catalyst functioning on an elementary-step level were derived from density functional theory calculations. Two types of Zr-cus sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation were suggested to exist on the surface of ZrO2. Those located at Rh NPs reveal higher intrinsic activity owing to the positive effect of the metal on hydrogen desorption, which is the rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction over bare ZrO2. However, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 is increased, propene strongly adsorbs on Rh, resulting in blockage of sites for hydrogen recombination. Consequently, the accelerating effect of the metal is hindered. Moreover, the strong propene adsorption plays a negative role in propene selectivity due to favoring conversion of the adsorbed propene into coke. The most active Rh/ZrO2 catalyst revealed higher activity in comparison with the state of the art Ru/YZrOx and an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3. It was also durable over 60 PDH/regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 degrees C lasting 11 days in total.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900042

The FeK/SWNTs catalyst outperforms the FeK/MWNTs catalyst in selectivity during CO2 hydrogenation to olefins with the selectivities being 62.3% and 52.4%, respectively. Of particular interest is that the FeK/SWNTs catalyst is more selective toward heavy olefins (C-5+(=) selectivity, 39.8%), whereas the FeK/MWNTs catalyst is more selective to light olefins (C-2-C-4(=) selectivity, 30.7%). The FeK/SWNTs catalyst also affords much lower selectivities to undesired CO and CH4 in addition to higher productivity of hydrocarbons, thus resulting in an unprecedentedly high productivity of heavy olefins of 27.6 mu mol(CO2) g(Fe)(-1) s(-1). The more electron-enriched exterior of SWNTs with large curvature, higher abundance of Hagg carbide, and stronger interaction with light olefins may rationalize the superior catalytic behavior of the FeK/SWNTs catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation to heavy olefins. The FeK/SWNTs catalyst also exhibited a minor change in catalytic performance in a 120 h stability test, highlighting SWNTs as a promising catalyst support for producing value-added chemicals from greenhouse gas CO2.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900043

This approach relies on the perturbation of the ground-state electronic properties of terminal alkynes through the formation and photoexcitation of copper acetylide intermediates. This process takes place through cooperative copper and organic photoredox catalysis and can be carried out in a stereodivergent manner. Thus, a systematic multivariate HTE screening spotlighted that a switch in the stereochemical outcome can be provoked by choosing an appropriate combination of ligand and base. The developed methodology has been applied to the stereoselective coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals with (hetero)aromatic terminal alkynes. As an additional practicality, similar reaction conditions allowed for the use of aromatic amines as radical precursors in a cross dehydrogenative coupling for the direct vinylation of inactivated C-H bonds.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900044

Computational docking studies of the indoline substrates in the MAO-N D11 catalytic site allowed for the rationalization of the biocatalytic mechanism and experimental results of the biotransformation.

Herein, we developed a universal salt-template strategy for the fabrication of atomically dispersed Fe atoms on ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets characterized by a dramatically high concentration of 13.5 wt %. The proposed Fe-N-C nanozymes with densely isolated FeN4 sites show high peroxidase-like activities and exhibit a specific activity of 25.33 U/mg, superior to Zn(Co)-N-C nanozymes. Both experiments and theoretical analysis revealed that FeN4 sites not only lead to the strong adsorption of H2O2 molecules but also weaken the bonding interaction between single Fe atom and two absorbed hydroxyl groups, lowering the energy barrier of the formation of hydroxyl radicals and therefore boosting their peroxidase-like activities. As expected, utilizing the peroxidase-like activity of Fe-N-C nanozymes, good sensitivity and selectivity for the intracellular H2O2 monitoring were realized. It offers a versatile approach for the construction of densely isolated M-N-C single-atom catalysts and achieves better understanding of single sites for the peroxidase-like catalytic mechanisms.									38	3	0	0	5	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900047

This Perspective describes recent efforts in modeling asymmetric reactions in enzymes by means of the quantum chemical cluster approach. The methodology is described briefly and a number of illustrative case studies performed recently at our laboratory are presented. The reviewed enzymes are limonene epoxide hydrolase, soluble epoxide hydrolase, arylmalonate decarboxylase, phenolic acid decarboxylase, benzoylformate decarboxylase, secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, acyl transferase, and norcoclaurine synthase. The challenges encountered in each example are discussed, and the modeling lessons learned are highlighted.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900048

Selectivity for C-O cleavage is determined by the relative rates of S(N)2 demethylation versus S(N)1 demethoxylation, with the axial or equatorial disposition of the silyloxonium ion intermediate acting as an important contributing factor. Modulation of the electron-donor power of the supporting phosphine ligands enables a switch in selectivity from demethylation of equatorial methyl ethers to 2 degrees demethoxylation. Applications of these accessible catalysts to the selective demethoxylation of the 3 alpha-methoxy group of cholic acid derivatives is demonstrated, including a switch in observed selectivity controlled by 7 alpha-substitution. The resting state of the catalyst has been characterized for two phosphine derivatives, demonstrating that the observed switch in C-O cleavage selectivity likely results from electronic factors rather than from a major perturbation of the catalyst structure.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900049

In contrast to precious palladium, rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium catalysts that are limited to electronically activated styrenes and acrylates, we herein disclose cobalt-catalyzed electro-oxidative C-H allylations with nonactivated alkenes. Thus, allylated benzamides were obtained with high levels of chemoselectivity, positional selectivity, and regioselectivity in the biomass-derived solvent gamma-valerolactone. Detailed mechanistic studies provided strong support for a base-assisted internal electrophilic-type substitution mechanism for the key C-H activation step. The cobaltaelectro-catalysis overall achieved resource-economy by avoiding the use of stoichiometric chemical oxidants, with H-2 as the only byproduct.									18	1	0	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900050

The synthesis of higher aliphatic amines was successfully operated in a continuous-flow miniplant. Key to success was the development of an integrated catalyst recycling for the homogeneous Rhodium/SulfoXantphos catalyst. With 1-decene and diethylamine as substrates, an average yield of the linear amine of 61% over 60 h of stable process operation was achieved. The catalyst recycling has been accomplished by using a thermomorphic multiphase system (TMS) consisting of methanol and n-dodecane, which was rationally established in batch experiments with a methodical approach. This TMS ensured high catalytic activities and facilitated an efficient catalyst separation and recycling. Before application in a continuous process, catalyst recyclability was proven, showing high catalyst activity over six runs with turnover frequencies up to 2400 h(-1).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900051

Among them, complexes with phosphino-iPr substituents ((POCR)-P-iPr'NP)Ir (4b, 4e, and 4g) exhibit very high catalytic activity for transfer dehydrogenation (TD) of both cyclic and linear alkanes. In the prototypical TD reaction of cyclooctane (COA) with tertbutylethylene (TBE), for example, 4g affords 14 720 turnovers at 200 degrees C, which are more than twofold of that obtained by the most efficient catalyst reported so far. Moreover, these complexes are highly effective for acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, giving a turnover frequency of 8.8 min(-1) for H2- production within the first 4 h. The effects of the linkers at the positions ortho to the Ir center have been elucidated by a systematic comparison of electronic and steric properties of these O/ N- and S/N-linked pincer systems to those of C/C-linked (PCP)-P-iPr, O/O-linked (POCOP)-P-iPr, and S/O-linked (PSCOP)-P-iPr systems. Examination of the structure-activity relationships reveals that alkane C-H bond addition to the 14e (pincer)Ir fragment (the ratedetermining step in the TD reaction) is more favored by (POCR)-P-iPr'NP relative to other pincers, largely due to the strong N-linker -> C(aryl) pi-donation. Compared to the parent (POCOP)-P-iPr complex with similarly pi-donating O-linkers, the energy of the alkene-bound out-of-cycle resting state is raised by (POCR)-P-iPr'NP primarily due to steric factors. Consequently, the incorporation of the N-linker exerts an overall favorable effect on the catalytic rates. In addition, we found that the thermal stability of these catalysts with different linker combinations differs significantly.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900053

We synthesized a series of neutral and cationic indium complexes supported by tridentate Schiff base ligands and investigated their reactivities for the homo- and copolymerization of lactide or epsilon-caprolactone and methyl methacrylate. We showed that the neutral indium complex (+/-)-(NNiOtBu)In(CH2SiMe3)(2) (2) catalyzes the sequential block copolymerization of lactide/epsilon-caprolactone and methyl methacrylate without any additional reagents or synthetic steps. The block copolymers were stringently characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and fractional precipitation techniques.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900054

This self-sensitized approach simplifies systems and efficiencies; therefore, complete understanding of mechanistic principles is essential for improving catalysts. Here, we present a comprehensive study of dark reactions using electrochemical techniques to understand the multiple pathways for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO by an example self-sensitized photocatalyst: [Ir(bip)(ppy)(CH3CN)](2+) (bip = 2,6-bis(benzimidazole)pyridine, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile under anhydrous conditions reveals electrocatalysis by a two electron cycle at -1.7 V vs Fc(+/0) (denoted the cat-1 region) in which the metallocarboxylate formed by binding of Ir(I) to CO2 is cleaved by CO2 as the oxide acceptor. At -1.9 V (denoted the cat-2 region), the Ir(CO2) intermediate is reduced and catalysis is accelerated. In the presence of water, Ir(CO2) is protonated to Ir(CO2H), which is reduced at a potential less negative than -1.7 V, and then, the oxide acceptor is either CO2 to form HCO3- or protons to release H2O and the conjugate base of the acid source. Further reduction of Ir(CO2H) at cat-2 again accelerates catalysis. Rates vary widely in these various regimes with the minimum kobs of 0.3 s(-1) for anhydrous cat-1 to a maximum cat-2 rate of 2100 s(-1) with 1% water. Competitive deactivation pathways were discovered as Ir-Ir dimerization without reacting with CO2 or the formation of a hydride-bridged dinuclear complex during extended electrolysis at a high water concentration. The Ir-Ir dimer was characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry and Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).									3	0	0	0	0	1	3			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900055

This Review outlines the recent advances in the development of nitrogen-centered carbonylation reactions, which consists of two parts: nitrogen-center-directed carbonylation reactions and carbon-ylative C-N bonds activation. According to the reaction mechanisms, two-electron- and single-electron-mediated carbonylation reactions were systematically classified and discussed in detail. Different inert bonds such as C(sp(2))-H, C(sp(3))-H, C-C, C(sp(3))-N, and C(sp(2))-N bonds can be activated and ready for a carbonylative transformation toward the synthesis of the corresponding carbonyl-containing compounds.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900056

This work sheds light on the lattice oxygen recovery mechanism on CuO/CeO2 catalysts during CO-PROX reaction, which is critical to guarantee both good activity and selectivity, but that is yet to be well understood. Particularly, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice do not form in significant amounts until advanced reaction degrees, whereas pulse O-2 isotopic tests confirm the involvement of catalyst oxygen in the CO and H-2 oxidation processes occurring at all stages of the CO-PROX reaction (Mars-van Krevelen). Further mechanistic insights are provided by operando near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) experiments, which prove the gradual CuO reduction and steady oxidized state of Ce ions until the very surface reduction of CeO2 at the point of selectivity loss. Experiments are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal a more facile oxygen refill according to the trend CuO > CeO2 > Cu2O. Overall, this work concludes that the oxygen recovery mechanism in CO-PROX switches from a direct mechanism, wherein oxygen restores vacancy sites in the partially reduced CuO particles, to a synergistic mechanism with the participation of ceria once CuxO particles reach a critical reduction state. This mechanistic switch ultimately results in a decrease in CO conversion in favor of the undesired H-2 oxidation, which opens-up future research on potential strategies to improve oxygen recovery.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900057

To be viable, a thorough understanding of plasma-catalyst synergisms must be gained, specifically establishing links between the gas-phase, gas-surface interface, and resulting material properties. Optical emission spectroscopy provides insights into the impact of Pt and zeolite catalysts on plasma species densities, energetics, reaction kinetics, and plasma-catalyst configurations within N2O plasmas. The role of material structure on gas-phase chemistry is revealed through the use of Pt catalysts with two morphologies and size scaling. The concentration of excited-state NO substantially decreased at high powers with Pt nanopowder or microstructured zeolites. All catalytic materials significantly decreased N-2 vibrational temperatures, with little impact on rotational temperatures. Conversely, Pt materials had a limited effect on vibrational temperatures of NO; however, Pt powder enhanced NO decomposition within a two-stage system over the single-stage system. Material characterization revealed that the plasma effectively poisons Pt materials, resulting in poorer performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900058

Here, we report promising DNA-based catalysts comprised of G-quadruplex (G4) and Fe porphyrin for asymmetric olefin cyclopropanation. After the G4-based catalysts are optimized by several rounds of site mutation, their catalytic enantioselectivities achieve +81% and -86% enantiomeric excess (ee(trans)) at a turnover number (TON) as high as 500. The Fe porphyrin, binding upon the 5',3'-end G-quartet, constitutes the active center for olefin cyclopropanation via an iron porphyrin carbene intermediate. The findings provide an opportunity for generating high-value chiral cyclopropane blocks via G4 biocatalysts and shed light on the potential of DNA as protein enzymes for catalysis.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900059

It is shown that CA addition increases the thiophene HDS activity. This may be directly ascribed to the increase in NiWS site concentration detected by IR spectroscopy. HRTEM emphasizes that the addition of CA to NiW catalysts decreases the average size of the particles. This is confirmed by HR STEM-HAADF that even evidences the presence of nanoclusters on NiW catalysts prepared with CA. Hence, local and global analysis of the NiW samples are in good agreement to account for the increase of NiWS site concentration by CA addition. Then the contrast and interatomic distances were analyzed in the atomic-scale images obtained by HR STEM-HAADF. These measurements allow identification of the nature of the atoms in the core and edge of the sulfided particles. The metal atoms of particle core are only W ones, whereas the edges of the particles could be either fully promoted with detection of only Ni atoms or partially promoted with detection of both Ni and W atoms. Accordingly, IR spectroscopy evidenced edge sites with different promotion degrees.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900060

However, construction of the pharmacophore of beta(2)-adrenoreceptor agonists with this method remains a great challenge because of complete racemization of the benzylic alcohol during deprotection of the acetal groups. In this study, structure-guided redesign of a hydroxynitrile lyase originating from Prunus communis (PcHNL5) enables a highly enantioselective hydrocyanation of rigid benzo-ketal aldehyde which was proved to be resistant against racemization during the deprotection step, with dramatically improved productivity (>95% conversion vs <1%). X-ray structure analysis and kinetic study revealed the side chain of L331 tunes the substrate adaptability of bulky and rigid benzoketal aldehyde, thereby facilitating the formation of a series of valuable unnatural cyanohydrins in high enantiopurities and good yields. Furthermore, the HNL variant L331A was successfully applied for a gram-scale chemo-enzymatic synthesis of (R)-salmeterol, a long-term beta(2) -adrenoreceptor agonist, in an optically pure form (>99% ee) with an overall yield of 54%, which is the highest value reported.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500039

The success of gram-level preparation and synthetic transformations proves the potential of this catalytic strategy for practical applications.

High enantioselectivity has been achieved for substrates over a wide scope. With the same chiral catalyst, nitroso-4-fluorobenzenes in these reactions under DCM/THF/water/air led to oxidative nitroso-Povarov reactions also with high enantioselectivity. We performed O-18-labeling experiments to confirm that both water and O-2 participate in the reactions; these data support a mechanism involving nitrosoarenes as nucleophiles and gold-pi-dienes as electrophiles.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500047

However, the structural diversity of these privileged substructures is currently limited by the need to manipulate highly toxic, highly reactive reagents and intermediates in their synthesis. In response to this longstanding challenge, we report an umpolung strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse di-tert-alkylphosphine building blocks via S(N)1 alkylation of in situ generated PH3 gas. We show that the products-which are isolated as air-stable, odorless phosphonium salts-can be used directly in the preparation of key synthetic intermediates and ligand classes. The di-tert-alkylphosphino building blocks that are accessible using our methodology therefore enable facile expansion of extant ligand classes by modification of a previously invariant vector; we demonstrate that these modifications affect the steric and electronic properties of the ligands and can be used to tune their performance in catalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500008

Three distinct classes of epoxides, styrene oxides, cyclic epoxides, and terminal aliphatic epoxides, all undergo coupling in moderate to good yield and high regioselectivity with the use of three different nitrogen-based ligands for Ni under otherwise identical reaction conditions. The mild reaction conditions accommodate a broad scope of abundant and complex coupling partners. Mechanistic studies suggest that when styrene oxides are employed radical intermediates are involved via Ti-radical ring-opening of the epoxide. Conversely, for terminal aliphatic epoxides, involvement of an iodohydrin intermediate enables the formation of the unexpected linear product.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500045	32747870

Mechanistic studies indicate that a radical chain mechanism operates, which proceeds via a phosphoranyl radical generated from a radical/ polar crossover process. Initiation of the radical chain was found to proceed via two opposing photocatalytic quenching mechanisms, offering complementary reactivity. The mild nature of the radical deoxygenation process enables the reduction of a wide range of functionalized sulfoxides, including those containing acid-sensitive groups, in typically high isolated yields.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500044	32582464

However, the detailed catalytic mechanism of coronavirus 3CL(Pro) remains largely unknown. We took an integrated approach of employing X-ray crystallography, mutational studies, enzyme kinetics study, and inhibitors to gain insights into the mechanism. Such experimental work is supplemented by computational studies, including the prereaction state analysis, the ab initio calculation of the critical catalytic step, and the molecular dynamic simulation of the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Taken together, such studies allowed us to identify a residue pair (Glu-His) and a conserved His as critical for binding; a conserved GSCGS motif as important for the start of catalysis, a partial negative charge cluster (PNCC) formed by Arg-Tyr-Asp as essential for catalysis, and a conserved water molecule mediating the remote interaction between PNCC and catalytic dyad. The data collected and our insights into the detailed mechanism have allowed us to achieve a good understanding of the difference in catalytic efficiency between 3CL(Pro) from SARS and MERS, conduct mutational studies to improve the catalytic activity by 8-fold, optimize existing inhibitors to improve the potency by 4-fold, and identify a potential allosteric site for inhibitor design. All such results reinforce each other to support the overall catalytic mechanism proposed herein.									20	0	0	0	10	1	21			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500051	32391184

However, conventional in situ click chemistry provides extremely low yields of the products, making it incompatible with direct activity-based assays. Here, to address this issue, we focused on the catalysis of azide-alkyne cycloaddition (AAC) by the metal ion in metalloproteins. We chose 2-ethynyl N-heterocompounds as alkyne fragments which are activated by coordination to the metal ion. For proof of concept, we applied metal ion-catalyzed in situ AAC to identify inhibitors of Fe(II)-dependent lysine demethylase 5C (KDM5C). The triazole product was obtained in dramatically high yield, dependently on Fe(II) in KDM5C, and the metalloprotein-catalyzed click reaction was compatible with activity-based high-throughput screening, enabling us to discover a potent KDM5C inhibitor. Thus, metal-catalyzed in situ AAC should be generally applicable to other metalloproteins.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500001

Directed evolution of a P450 variant, P411-C10, yielded a lineage of enzyme variants capable of forming chiral lactone derivatives with high catalytic efficiency (up to 4000 TTN) and in a stereodivergent manner. For carbene insertion into secondary C-H bonds, a single mutation was discovered to invert the two contiguous chiral centers and lead to the opposite enantiomers of the same major diastereomers. This work demonstrates the utility of engineered enzymes for asymmetric catalysis and highlights the remarkable tunability of these genetically encoded biocatalysts for accessing the desired selectivities.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500002

This transformation is more challenging than when using more strained epoxide comonomers and even more so when it is performed using metalfree routes. Herein, we report an organocatalytic oxetane/CO2 coupling procedure that enables the selection of cyclic carbonate or polymer from a common intermediate. Using a novel I-2-based binary catalyst system, cyclic carbonate with high selectivity (up to 94%) was obtained at 55 degrees C, whereas simply changing the temperature to 105 degrees C yielded the polycarbonate with M-n of up to 6.4 kDa, thus showing that either trimethylene carbonate or its concomitant polycarbonate product can be selected solely by the manipulation of the reaction conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500003

In this reaction, coproheme is converted to heme b via monovinyl monopropionate deuteroheme (MMD) in two consecutive decarboxylation steps. In Firmicutes decarboxylation of propionates 2 and 4 of coproheme depend on hydrogen peroxide and the presence of a catalytic tyrosine. Here we demonstrate that ChdCs from Actinobacteria are unique in using a histidine (H118 in ChdC from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, CdChdC) as a distal base in addition to the redox-active tyrosine (Y135). We present the X-ray crystal structures of coproheme-CdChdC and MMD-CdChdC, which clearly show (i) differences in the active site architecture between Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and (ii) rotation of the redox-active reaction intermediate (MMD) after formation of the vinyl group at position 2. Distal H118 is shown to catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide (k(app) = (4.90 +/- 1.25) X 10(4) M-1 s(-1)). The resulting Compound I is rapidly converted to a catalytically active Compound I* (oxoiron(IV) Y135(center dot)) that initiates the radical decarboxylation reactions. As a consequence of the more efficient Compound I formation, actinobacterial ChdCs exhibit a higher catalytic efficiency in comparison to representatives from Firmicutes. On the basis of the kinetic data of wild-type CdChdC and the variants H118A, Y135A, and H118A/Y135A together with high-resolution crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations, we present a molecular mechanism for the hydrogen peroxide dependent conversion of coproheme via MMD to heme b and discuss differences between ChdCs from Actinobacteria and Firmicutes.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500004	32440366

However, this type of reaction has so far been limited to activated allenes bearing an electron-withdrawing group. On the other hand, cleavage of an amide C-N bond to forge other chemical bonds has been widely reported but restricted to low atom economy due to the waste of the amine moiety of amides. We initiated a project of metal-catalyzed amino-acylation of allenes via cleavage of amide C-N bonds. Surprisingly, an amino-acylation of weakly activated aryl allenes was discovered via Lewis base catalysis, providing 2-methyl-3-aroylindole products, "privileged structures" in drug discovery. This is a unique example of Lewis base catalysis of weakly activated allenes, which was not reported yet. Extensive experimental and computational studies have been conducted to provide insight into the reaction mechanism. The nucleophilic addition of Lewis base catalyst to aryl allene is the rate-limiting step. A challenging [1,3]-proton transfer is realized by nitrogen anion intermediate assisted sequential [1,4]- and [1,6]-proton transfer in the reaction pathway.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500005

The effect of a preparative route on N2O decomposition activity has been examined for a PrBaCoO3 perovskite catalyst. Initially, citric acid preparation was utilized, where the A site ratio was altered in order to increase phase purity. Comparable compositions were then prepared by an oxalic acid precipitation method and by a supercritical antisolvent (SAS) technique to produce perovskites with a higher surface area (>30 m(2) g(-1)). By altering the A site ratio, it was possible to reduce the temperature required to produce a pure phase perovskite while maintaining a higher surface area. The use of the different preparation methods resulted in perovskites with varying properties, as determined by N-2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), oxygen temperature-programmed desorption, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). This work confirms the importance of lattice oxygen species that have high oxygen mobility for enhanced decomposition of N2O, as oxygen recombination is considered the rate-limiting step. Here, the formation of molecular oxygen is limited by surface- adsorbed O species being within a distance at which oxygen recombination is possible. The most active PrBaCo-based catalyst did not have the highest percentage of lattice oxygen as shown by XPS; however, the catalytic activity could be correlated to the mobile oxygen species and high surface area. The PrBaCo-based catalyst prepared by SAS converted 50% of the N2O present in the feed (T-50) at 410 degrees C, which represents a significant improvement over reported catalytic performance measured under similar conditions.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500006

The highly electron-donating nature of these abnormal N-heterocyclic carbenes (aNHCs) embedded in the carbene-phenolate chelating ligand scaffold resulted in good catalytic activity, generating linear polyethylene with a high molecular weight (M-n = 237 000). aImPy-Pd complexes efficiently catalyzed propylene polymerization to afford polypropylene free of regio defects. These catalytic systems exhibit good tolerance of various polar monomers and afford the desired copolymers. Up to 3.0% of the polar monomers were incorporated into the main chain, as determined by H-1 and C-13 NMR analysis. Furthermore, methyl methacrylate (MMA), as a 1,1-disubstituted ethylene derivative, was successfully incorporated into the main chain of polyethylene. Computational studies indicated that ethylene insertion into a Pd-alkyl bond by aImPy-Pd catalyst 6a is faster than that by the Pd catalyst bearing normal NHC analogues, which could be attributed to the high linearity and high molecular weight of polyethylene.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500007

Thiolate surfactants can greatly improve the overall yield; however, the dynamics of the reacting species and the reaction mechanism have remained unknown at the molecular scale. We elucidated the interaction of a series of aromatic compounds with octadecylthiolate-modified palladium nanocatalysts in atomic detail and explain large increases in product selectivity and yield through a detailed reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal adsorption free energies on the order of -5 kcal/mol on the ligand-modified nanoparticles, which are significantly smaller than those on bare metal surfaces, where -10 to -30 kcal/mol are found. The ligands induce a two-step process of condensation in the ligand shell and adsorption, leading to upright molecular orientations, in contrast to single-step adsorption on bare metal surfaces. Exothermic condensation into the ligand shell and binding to the metal surface are accompanied by large entropy losses due to the reduced mobility in the ligand shell and increased confinement of the alkyl chains. Results from molecular dynamics simulations using the interface force field (IFF) show impressive agreement with available thermochemical reference data from experiments. Upright orientations of aromatic alcohol reactants lower the activation energy for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction and suppress competing decarbonylation reactions. The analysis of the HDO reaction mechanism by QM/MM calculations in the presence of the ligands as well as by DFT calculations under vacuum uncovers the acidic and basic properties of hydrogenated Pd surfaces. The rate-limiting step involves the transfer of Pd-bound hydrogen atoms to hydroxyl groups in the alcohol reactants. The mechanism explains prior experimental data and supports the rational design of metal and alloy catalysts of specific shape, ligand coverage, and reaction conditions for biomass upgrading.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500009

However, direct deuteration at allylic C-H moieties is still a challenge. Few examples have been reported by transition-metal catalysis and no such reports have been documented in an organocatalytic fashion. Herein, a carbene-catalyzed C-H deuteration of enal at allylic C(sp(3)) and C(sp(2)) centers is disclosed. Addition of the carbene catalyst to the aldehyde moiety of enals to eventually activate the alpha- and gamma-carbon atom under oxidative conditions is critical to achieve high deuterium incorporation. Key mechanistic steps of our reaction include carbene catalyst addition, azolium ester formation, remote gamma-carbon activation, reversible alpha-and gamma-carbon enolization, and iterative H/D exchanges. The reaction is performed under mild conditions using D2O as the deuterium source to efficiently afford alpha,gamma-deuterated 2-alkenoic acids and their derivatives in good to excellent yields and high deuterium incorporation. These labeled products containing carbonyl and allyl bifunctionalities are valuable building blocks for further transformations, eventually leading to otherwise challenging labeled targets including deuterated allylic derivatives, aliphatic derivatives and polydeuterated drugs (e.g., Ibuprofen). The convenient and scalable synthesis has application potential for materials and pharmaceuticals.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500010

Herein, we demonstrate how Pd/NiO is able to direct the selectivity of furfural hydrogenation and maintain performance at low Pd loading by a unique dual-site mechanism. Sol-immobilization was used to prepare 1 wt % Pd nanoparticles supported on NiO and TiO2, with the Pd/NiO catalyst showing enhanced activity with a significantly different selectivity profile; Pd/NiO favors tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (72%), whereas Pd/TiO2 produces furfuryl alcohol as the major product (68%). Density functional theory studies evidenced significant differences on the adsorption of furfural on both NiO and Pd surfaces. On the basis of this observation we hypothesized that the role of Pd was to dissociate hydrogen, with the NiO surface adsorbing furfural. This dual-site hydrogenation mechanism was supported by comparing the performance of 0.1 wt % Pd/NiO and 0.1 wt % Pd/TiO2. In this study, the 0.1 and 1 wt % Pd/NiO catalysts had comparable activities, whereas there was a 10-fold reduction in performance for 0.1 wt % Pd/TiO2. When TiO2 is used as the support, the Pd nanoparticles are responsible for both hydrogen dissociation and furfural adsorption and the activity is strongly correlated with the effective metal surface area. This work has significant implications for the upgrading of bioderived feedstocks, suggesting alternative ways for promoting selective transformations and reducing the reliance on precious metals.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500011

During N-2 photofixation, Fe-1/C-PPh3/NaI exhibited an NH3 production rate of 98 mu mol/(g(cat.).h) without any sacrificial agents, even 1.5 times as high as that for Fe-1/C using tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2) as the photosensitizer. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Fe-1/C-PPh3/NaI effectively harvested photons by delivering hot electrons from adsorbed PPh3/NaI to Fe single atoms under light irradiation, together with the generation of PPh3-I-center dot radicals. The hot electrons reduced N-2 to NH3 over Fe single atoms, while PPh3-I-center dot radicals were regarded to oxidize H2O to O-2 .									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500013

Compared with most previous reports for this transformation, which use high temperatures (typically, 100-200 degrees C) and H-2 pressures (10-100 bar), this system proceeds under extremely mild conditions (RT, 5-10 bar of H-2). The hydrogenation is catalyzed by well-defined ruthenium-PNNH pincer complexes (0.5 mol %) with potential dual modes of metal-ligand cooperation. An unusual Ru-amidate complex was formed and crystallo-graphically characterized. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the room-temperature hydrogenation proceeds predominantly via the Ru-N amido/amine metal-ligand cooperation.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500014	32455053

Mass spectrometry and ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopy measurements support the existence of 4-nitrosophenol as a stable reaction intermediate. We propose that dissolved oxygen is consumed, both by oxidizing 4-nitrosophenol (an intermediate) and reoxidizing the reduced catalyst surface, resulting in the commonly observed "induction period" in the reaction kinetics. Upon complete consumption of dissolved oxygen, subsequent reduction to 4-aminophenol can occur. A complete kinetic analysis including modeling is presented, conceptually fitting data from recent reports in the literature, as well as fitting data from our own experiments.									28	0	0	0	1	1	28			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500015

Here, we present the idea of introducing favorable catalyst-reactant interaction in achieving efficient photocatalytic regeneration of nicotinamide (NADH) cofactor by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The electrostatic attraction emanating from the ligands on the surface of NP increases the channeling and local concentration of NAD(+) reactants around AuNP photocatalysts, thereby enhancing the probability of the electron transfer process. Detailed kinetics- and intensity-dependent studies confirm the involvement of multiple electron transfer from the AuNP photocatalyst to the NAD(+) reactant. The photocatalytic performances of AuNPs presented here are comparable to or greater than most of the catalytic systems reported based on plasmonic NP, with the added advantage of being structurally less complex. The use of electrostatics mimics the underlying force involved in various enzyme catalysis, which can serve as a generic approach for other important artificial multielectron photocatalytic reactions as well.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500016

However, directly measuring the lattice strain of individual catalyst nanoparticles is challenging, especially at the scale of a single unit cell. Here, we quantitatively map the strain present in rhodium@platinum (core@shell) nanocube electrocatalysts using conventional aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the recently developed technique of 4D-STEM nanobeam electron diffraction. We demonstrate that 4D-STEM combined with data preconditioning allows for quantitative lattice strain mapping with subpicometer precision and without the influence of scan distortions. When combined with multivariate curve resolution, 4D-STEM allows us to distinguish the nanocube core from the shell and to quantify the unit cell size as a function of distance from the core-shell interface. Our results demonstrate that 4D-STEM has significant precision and accuracy advantages in strain metrology of catalyst materials compared to aberration-corrected STEM imaging and is beneficial for extracting information about the evolution of strain in catalyst nanoparticles.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500017

Herein, we have discovered that Rhphotodeposited TiO2 nanoparticles selectively dehydrogenate N-heterocyclic amines with the concomitant generation of molecular hydrogen gas in an inert atmosphere under visible light (lambda(max) = 453 nm) illumination at room temperature. Initially, a visible-light-sensitive surface complex is formed between the N-heterocycle and TiO2. The acceptorless dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles is initiated by direct electron transfer from the HOMO energy level of the amine via the conduction band of TiO2 to the Rh nanoparticle. The reaction condition was optimized by examining different photodeposited noble metals on the surface of TiO2 and solvents, finding that Rh-0 is the most efficient cocatalyst, and 2-propanol is the optimal solvent. Structurally diverse N-heterocycles such as tetrahydroquinolines, tetrahydroisoquinolines, indolines, and others bearing electron-deficient as well as electron-rich substituents underwent the dehydrogenation in good to excellent yields. The amount of released hydrogen gas evinces that only the N-heterocyclic amines are oxidized rather than the dispersant. This developed method demonstrates how UV-active TiO2 can be employed in visible-light-induced synthetic dehydrogenation of amines and simultaneous hydrogen storage applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500018

Metal dispersion, metal reducibility, catalytic performance, and catalyst stability are usually strongly affected by the interaction of the active phase and support. A strong metal-support interaction has been previously reported for titania-supported catalysts. In this work, a series of titania-supported cobalt catalysts promoted via the deposition of a layer of carbon nitride were prepared, characterized, and tested in FT synthesis. The catalytic performance of freshly activated catalysts was an interplay of cobalt dispersion and reducibility. The deposition of carbon nitride on the surface of titania resulted in a noticeable enhancement of cobalt dispersion, whereas it hindered cobalt reducibility to some extent. The nonpromoted cobalt catalysts exhibited a noticeable deactivation in FT synthesis. The catalyst deactivation was due to the progressive encapsulation of the cobalt active phase by TiO2 during the reaction. A carbon nitride layer on the TiO2 surface stabilized cobalt nanoparticles and prevented the encapsulation of active sites by the TiO2 species. The stability was significantly enhanced on all titania-supported cobalt catalysts promoted with carbon nitride.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500019

Humidified H-2 is also widely used for emerging perovskite anodes of SOFCs, although the influences of H2O on the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on their surfaces have not been well understood yet. In this work, the effects of H2O on the HOR on Sr2Fe1.5 Mo0.5O6-delta (SF1.5M), La-0.5 Sr-1.5 Fe-1.5 Mo0.5O6-delta (LSFM), and Pr-0.5 Sr-1.5 Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (PSFM) were systematically investigated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) methods. The EIS spectra suggested the possible promotional effect of H2O on decreasing the polarization resistance of SF1.5M. The ECR results confirmed that the presence of H2O in H-2 can significantly increase the oxygen exchange coefficients of SF1.5M, LSFM, and PSFM. To gain a mechanistic understanding of the role of H2O, the density functional theory-based calculations and thermodynamic modeling were performed to unravel the effect of H2O on the HOR on the SF1.5M (001) surfaces. Benefiting from the increment of the oxygen chemical potential and decrement of the free electron concentration upon increasing humidity, the plateau intermediate state in the HOR energy landscape, the step of H2O plus surface oxygen vacancy formation, is reduced on the SF1.5M (001) BO2 (B = Fe and Mo)-terminated surfaces, when decreasing the slab oxygen nonstoichiometry. Furthermore, by comparing the scenarios of the HOR on the dry and hydrated surfaces, the H2O plus surface oxygen vacancy formation energies are lower in the latter case. These two proposed factors, i.e., (i) change of electron chemical potential upon the change of near-surface delta and (ii) enhanced interaction of surface H species with the hydrated perovskite surfaces, contribute to the promoted HOR in the presence of H2O. This work provides important insights into the effects of H2O on the HOR for SOFCs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500020

Computational investigations dealing with zeolite catalysts have been undertaken for decades with simple models of the bulk sites, known to be bridging Si-IV-OH-Al-IV groups, in the case where the compensation cation is a proton. Real zeolite catalysts used in practice are however finite size and intricate objects, with external surface sites and defects, among other sources of complexity. Amorphous silica-alumina may also be obtained as a consequence of zeolite post-treatments or synthesized on purpose to obtain acid sites that are milder than those of zeolites. In the present Perspective, some of the achievements in the field of the atomic-scale simulation of intricate aluminosilicate catalysts (zeolites, amorphous silica-aluminas) of industrial relevance are reviewed. Emphasis is put on the simulation of the mechanisms of post-treatments of zeolites, and on the special structure and reactivity of acid sites at external surfaces of zeolites and on amorphous silica-alumina, that is shown to differ from the properties of the bulk bridging sites. Moreover, directions for future investigations are proposed.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500021

In contrast to most earlier studies, the emphasis is on the entire mechanism, including the oxidation steps. An estimate of the driving force is made, and the main effects of entropy are included. Two different mechanisms are investigated, not only the standard heterolytic cleavage but also homolytic cleavage. Heterolytic cleavage occurs for a NiFe(II,II) oxidation state, while homolytic cleavage occurs for a NiFe(I,II) state. The finding of a previously unreported transition state leads to a lower barrier for the latter mechanism. To reach the homolytic mechanism, one cycle of the heterolytic mechanism is needed. It is argued that the use of the very unusual active site, including CO and CN ligands, is not due to the efficiency of the H-H cleavage but rather to a minimization of the energy loss in the oxidation steps. This means that the H-H cleavage is not preceded by a good binding of molecular H-2. Instead, the transition state is reached directly from the reactant state with a free H-2.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500023

As such, Cs-promoted Ru/MgO catalysts used in the Kellogg process show superiority to Fe-based catalysts at milder conditions; however, as known, the surface poisoning of Ru sites by competitive strong H-2 dissociative adsorption limits the overall rate. In this study, it is demonstrated that the use of simple electrostatically polar MgO(111) to replace nonpolar MgO as the support can significantly alleviate the hydrogen poisoning and facilitate an unprecedented ammonia production rate by its high intrinsic proton capture ability.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500024

However, only very few reports are available for the metal-free electrocatalysis over COFs. Herein, we developed a new thiadiazole-based COF, C4-SHz COF, through the reaction between 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene and 2,5-dihydrazinyl- 1,3,4-thiadiazole that possesses a very high specific surface area of 1224 m(2) g(-1), unique molecular architecture, high porosity, and abundant active sites. The synthesized C4-SHz COF displayed superior electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and excellent long-term durability. The electrocatalytic performance of the C4-SHz COF achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 320 mV. The higher activity of the C4-SHz COF could be attributed to the high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, porosity, and network structure of the pi-conjugated organic building blocks, which allowed fast charge and mass transport processes. This work validates the promising potential of a metal-free COF electrocatalyst toward the OER and its capability to replace carbon-based electrocatalysts.									29	1	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500025

EcNikA-Rul, an artificial metalloenzyme developed by embedding a ruthenium-based catalyst into the cavity of the periplasmic nickel-binding protein NikA, was found to efficiently and selectively transform certain alkenes. The objective of this study was to provide a rationale on the enzymatic function and the unexpected substrate-dependent chemoselectivity of EcNikA-Rul thanks to a dual experimental/computational study. We observed that the de novo active site allows the formation of the terminal oxidant via the formation of a ruthenium aquo species that subsequently reacts with the hypervalent iodine of phenyl iodide diacetic acid. The oxidation process relies on a Ru-IV = 0 pathway via a two-step reaction with a radical intermediate, resulting in the formation of either a chlorohydrin or an epoxide. The results emphasize the impact of the protein scaffold on the kinetics of the reaction, through (i) the promotion of the starting oxidizing species via the exchange of a CO ligand with a water molecule; and (ii) the control of the substrate orientation on the intermediate structures, formed after the Ru-IV= 0 attack. When a C alpha attack is preferred, chlorohydrins are formed while an attack on C beta leads to an epoxide. This work provides evidence that artificial enzymes mimic the behavior of their natural counterparts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500026

Herein, we use density functional theory calculations to suggest a complete reaction mechanism for low-temperature NH3-SCR The reaction is found to proceed in a multisite fashion over ammonia-solvated Cu cations Cu(NH3)(2+) and Bronsted acid sites. The activation of oxygen and the formation of the key intermediates HONO and H2NNO occur on the Cu sites, whereas the Bronsted acid sites facilitate the decomposition of HONO and H2NNO to N-2 and H2O. The activation and reaction of NO is found to proceed via the formation of nitrosonium (NO+) or nitrite (NO2-) intermediates. These low-temperature mechanisms take the dynamic character of Cu sites into account where oxygen activation requires pairs of Cu(NH3)(2+) complexes, whereas HO-NO and H3N-NO coupling may occur on single complexes. The formation and separation of Cu pairs is assisted by NH3 solvation. The complete reaction mechanism is consistent with measured kinetic data and provides a solid basis for future improvements of the low-temperature NH3-SCR reaction.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500027

In the presence of an electrophilic fluorinating bystanding oxidant and acetic acid, a wide range of aliphatic amines could be oxygenated selectively at the gamma-methyl positions. A vast variety of aryl, heteroaryl, and aliphatic acids could also be successfully coupled under this C-O bond formation reaction to afford amine-containing esters. Switching the nucleophile from acids to alcohols enables alkoxylation of free amines. Importantly, natural products and drug molecules such as ibuprofen, isoxepac, fenbufen, and lithocholic acid are all compatible coupling partners. Notably, synthesis of these monoprotected amino alcohols from free amino alcohols using conventional selective protection are not always feasible.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500028	33996194

The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is a prototypical example where the oxide support dictates catalytic activity, yet the cause for this remains uncertain. Herein, we show that a single descriptor-the equilibrium constant for hydroxyl formation-relates the WGS turnover frequency across disparate oxide supports. The dissimilar equilibrium constant, or oxophilicity, between early and late transition metals exemplifies the utility of metal-support interfacial sites to circumvent adsorption-energy scaling restrictions, thereby providing bifunctional gains for the WGS reaction class. In relation, the equilibrium constant for hydroxyl formation is equivalent to the equilibrium constant for the formal heterolytic dissociation of hydrogen and therefore reflects the ability of the metal-support interface to participate in hydrogen heterolysis. The ubiquitous coexistence, yet divergent chemical reactivity of homo- and heterolytically activated hydrogen, renders the identity of the oxide support central toward our understanding of hydrogenation catalysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500029

The promoting effect of Al3+ on the ZnO support for CO2 activation via the reverse water-gas-shift reaction has been investigated. The contact-free and operando microwave Hall Effect technique is applied to measure charge carriers in Cu/ZnO(:Al) based model catalysts under reverse water-gas shift reaction conditions. This method allows us to monitor the electrical conductivity, charge carrier mobility, and absolute number of charge carriers. An increase in charge carrier concentration with increasing Al3+ content and its direct correlation with the catalytic activity for CO formation is found. We conclude that the increased availability of charge carriers plays a key role in CO2 activation and CO formation, which finds additional support in a concurrent decrease of the apparent activation energy and increase in the reaction order of CO2. In combination with comprehensive DFT calculations, the impact of the interfacial charge transfer, coupled to oxygen defect sites in ZnO and CO2 adsorption properties, is elucidated and highlighted. In conclusion, the results from this operando investigation combined with DFT calculations demonstrate the importance of charge transfer processes as decisive descriptors for understanding and explaining catalytic properties.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500030

Tuning the activity and product selectivity while maintaining long-term stability, however, remains a significant challenge. Here, we study a series of Au-Pb bimetallic electrocatalysts with different Au/Pb interfaces, generating carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), and methane (CH4) as CO2 reduction products. The formation of CH4 is significant because it has only been observed on very few Cu-free electrodes. The maximum CH4 formation rate of 0.33 mA cm(-2) was achieved when the most Au/Pb interfaces were present. In situ Raman spectroelectrochemical studies confirmed the stability of the Pb native substoichiometric oxide under the reduction conditions on the Au-Pb catalyst, which seems to be a major contributor to CH4 formation. Density functional theory simulations showed that without Au, the reaction would get stuck on the COOH intermediate, and without O, the reaction would not evolve further than the CHOH intermediate. In addition, they confirmed that the Au/Pb bimetallic interface (together with the subsurface oxygen in the model) possesses a moderate binding strength for the key intermediates, which is indeed necessary for the CH4 pathway. Overall, this study demonstrates how bimetallic nanoparticles can be employed to overcome scaling relations in the CO2 reduction reaction.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500031	32455054

Herein, we propose a rational linker scission approach to induce lattice strain in metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts by partially replacing multicoordinating linkers with nonbridging ligands. Strained NiFe-MOFs with 6% lattice expansion exhibit a superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions; the overpotential is reduced to 230 mV (86.6 mV dec(-1)) from 320 mV (164.9 mV dec(-1)) for the unstrained NiFe-MOFs at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Operando studies by using synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy identified the emergence of a key *OOH intermediate on sites during OER, providing strong evidence that the Ni3+/4+ sites are the active sites and the formation of *OOH is the rate-limiting step. The first-principles calculations were performed to reveal the strain-induced electronic structure changes of the NiFe-MOFs and the Gibbs free energy profile during OER It is found that the optimized Ni 3d eg-orbital facilitates the formation of *OOH, thus enhancing the OER performance of the strained MOFs.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500032

Here, we demonstrate that a thorough mechanistic study of a multistep reaction can guide us to the controllable selective synthesis of phenyltetrahydroquinoline or phenylquinoline with easily accessible precursors. The one-pot production can be achieved, catalyzed by a well-defined, bifunctional metal-organic framework-supported Pd nanoparticles, with only water as the side product. Our mechanistic study identifies six transient intermediates and ten transformation steps from the operando magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance study under 27.6 bar H-2. In particular, reactive intermediate 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinoline cannot be observed with conventional chromatographic techniques but is found to reach the maximal concentration of 0.11 mol L-1 under the operando condition. The most probable reaction network is further deduced based on the kinetic information of reaction species, obtained from both operando and ex situ reaction studies. This deep understanding of the complex reaction network enables the kinetic control of the conversions of key intermediate, 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinoline, with the addition of a homogeneous co-catalyst, allowing the selective production of tetrahydroquinoline or quinoline on demand. The demonstrated methods in this work open up new avenues toward efficient modulation of reactions with a complex network to achieve desired selectivities.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500034

Herein, we report an intercalation-structured hollow carbon nitride sphere composed of carbon nitride nanosheets (HCNS) with atomically dispersed Cu1N3 moieties embedded within nanosheets (Cu1@HCNS) prepared by a facile molecular assembly approach. It exhibits far superior photoredox catalysis to the pristine HCNS and the modified HCNS with Cu1N3 moieties anchored on the surface of nanosheets (Cu1/HCNS) for solar hydrogen production (3261 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) rate with 7.1% of apparent quantum yield), in which the embedded single-atom Cu acts as a modifier to effectively modulate the electron structure and remarkably promote interfacial charge transfer of PCN rather than act as active sites to facilitate surface reaction. It can be extended to the nonoxygen coupling of benzylamine and derivants to corresponding imines, and the unexpectedly high reaction rate is achieved. The promoting effect strongly depends on the location of single-atom Cu in the PCN, and the coordination method is a very effective strategy to introduce single-atom metals in terms of the improvement in photocatalysis of PCN owing to the intensified metal-PCN interaction. This work opens up a window for further improving the photocatalytic efficiency of carbon nitride in terms of solar fuel production and clean organic synthesis.									18	1	0	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500035

The effective utilization of alkalis in catalyst optimization requires the fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanism. In this work, we take a potassium (K)-modified CuxO/Cu(111) (x <= 2) model surface as a case study to rationalize the nature of K during the carbon dioxide hydrogenation using combined density functional theory (DFT) calculation and the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation. Our result demonstrates the significant tuning of selectivity from carbon monoxide to methanol on going from Cu(111) to K-modified CuxO/Cu(111). The deposited K+ stabilizes the CuxO thin film under the reducing condition of carbon dioxide hydrogenation. More importantly, our study reveals that K+ acts as an active center for selective tuning in the binding, an accelerator for charge transfer, and a mediator for the electron tunneling. As a result, the K-modified CuxO/Cu(111) opens a methanediol [H2C(OH)(2)]-mediated formate pathway to facilitate the selective conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol. Our study develops the intrinsic rules of design to tune the catalytic performance using alkali metals.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500036

At the moment, most of the efforts in this field have been aimed at increasing the productivity, rather than at the control of the product distribution. Particularly, compounds with two or more carbons (C2+) have higher added value than methane, carbon monoxide, or formate, which are typically the major products of CO2 reduction. This review focuses on those reports that have described the formation of compounds of two or more carbon atoms (C2+) in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction either by H2O or as H-2 as a source of electrons and protons. The existing literature has been organized according to the main factor considered to be responsible for the selectivity to C2+ products, including photocatalyst structuration, nature of the co-catalyst, influence of defects, and effects of surface plasmon band. Emphasis has been made on remarking the current empirical knowledge based on experimental results and the lack of predictive capability that could lead to the development of efficient photocatalytic systems for C2+ production.									61	0	0	0	7	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500037

Current thermochemical methods for the formation of some lactones rely on molecular oxidants, which yield stoichiometric side products that result in a poor atom economy and impose safety hazards when in contact with organic substrates and solvents. Electrochemical synthesis can alleviate these concerns by exploiting an applied potential to enable the possibility of a clean and safe route for lactonization. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of electrochemical lactone formation from cyclic ketones. When using a platinum anode and cathode in acetonitrile with 10 M H2O and 400 mM cyclohexanone, we found that non-Baeyer-Villiger products, delta-hexanolactone and gamma-caprolactone, are formed with a total Faradaic efficiency of similar to 20%. Isotope labeling experiments support that water is the oxygen atom source for this reaction. In addition, electrochemical kinetic data suggest a first-order dependence on water at low water concentrations (<2 M H2O) and a zeroth order dependence on the substrate, cyclohexanone. A Tafel slope of 139 mV/decade was measured at 400 mM cyclohexanone and 10 M H2O, implying an initial electron transfer as the rate-determining step. Literature-proposed mechanisms for similar transformations suggest an outer-sphere pathway. However, on the basis of the collected electrochemical kinetic data, we propose the possibility that Pt reacts with water in an initial electron transfer that forms Pt-OH, which can subsequently react with the ketone substrate. A subsequent electron transfer forms a ring-opened carboxylic acid cation that can reclose to form either of the observed five- or six-membered ring lactone products.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500038

Various cyclic alkenyl and alkadienyl carbenium ions have been proposed as active intermediates for light olefin production, but direct experimental evidence demonstrating the transformation of these hydrocarbon pool species with product formation is lacking. In this contribution, the interpretations of UV-vis and IR spectra are advanced to provide detail on the species present during catalysis; selected individual species are generated inside the catalyst pores, and their reactivity is tracked. The basis for the interpretation is a multitude of reference spectra of acyclic and cyclic dienes, trienes, and corresponding protonated species in the liquid phase (organic medium or sulfuric acid) or sorbed on dealuminated or acidic zeolites, augmented by trends extracted from these spectra. Accordingly, spectroscopic signatures indicate the presence of both polymethylbenzenium ions and alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations during the conversion of methanol on H-ZSM-S at 300 degrees C. To elucidate their role, alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations are generated from acyclic polyenes adsorbed on H-ZSM-5 at room temperature. Cyclization and cleavage are monitored via changes in the electronic and vibrational absorption spectra with increasing temperature. The formation of ethene, propene, and butenes from alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations, in the absence of methylbenzenium ions, is unambiguously demonstrated by temperature-programmed reaction (TPReact) spectroscopy coupled with online gas-phase product analysis. In the UV-vis range, the wavelength of maximum absorption, lambda(max), of the alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cation is linearly dependent on the total number of carbons in the cation. A blue shift in the position of lambda(max )of these cyclopentenyl cations during the TPReact indicates a loss of three carbons, which matches the average size of the concomitantly produced olefins.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500040

By means of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we investigated the reaction on a palladium foil exposed to different mixtures at increasing temperature. Water affects the long-term catalyst stability and blocks the active sites, ascribed to the hydroxyl inhibition effect. We investigated such an effect both under steady state and transient reaction conditions to understand the mechanism of inhibition. The hydroxyl formation on the surface of palladium blocks the sites for methane activation, postponing the formation of the active palladium oxide phase in the bulk.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500041

Nevertheless, systems which isomerize alkenes with complete regio-and stereoselectivity are rare. Most reported cases proceed through 1,3-hydrogen shift (allyl) mechanisms, rather than the generally more common 1,2-hydride shift (alkyl) mechanism, provoking consideration of the unique opportunities the former mechanism offers. Accordingly, the first part of this Perspective article will cover stereoselective alkene isomerization systems operating through 1,3-hydrogen shift mechanisms, with an emphasis on the origin of stereocontrol. Next, examples where these systems are employed in tandem with subsequent transformations to rapidly form complex molecular architecture will be discussed, illustrating the potential of alkene isomerization as a strategic tool in stereoselective synthesis.									22	0	0	0	6	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500042

The catalytic property of MNPs was usually regulated through introducing modifier effects and metal-support effects, and the common nature of these strategies involved either the construction of steric hindrance on the surface of MNPs or the regulation of surface electronic state of MNPs, which inspired us to employ metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a support due to their tailorable physical-chemical environments. Herein, we utilized the MOF matrixes to encapsulate MNPs (MNPs@MOFs) as catalysts which showed good selectivity and high conversion in the hydrogenation reaction of the citronellal molecule. Three kinds of Pt@MOF catalysts (Pt@ZIF-8, Pt@ZIF-67, and Pt@UiO-66) with different channel environments (pore size, metal sites, etc.) were designed, and it was found that Pt@ZIF-67 exhibited comparable selectivity (>99%) and higher activity (turnover frequency = 42.28 h(-1)). The high selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols was derived from the steric effect of the ZIF-67 pore, which regulated the diffusion status of the citronellal molecule in the channels, while the high catalytic activity of MNPs originated from the electronic effect between ZIF-67 and Pt NPs. Such results were also validated by the molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory calculation, further demonstrating that unsaturated alcohols can be formed through the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes by reasonably designing the channel environment of MNPs/MOFs that regulated the steric and electronic effects simultaneously.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500043

The reactions proceed with high catalytic activity and high enantioselectivity. N-Methyl-N-phenyl allylic amines were indispensable to achieve the high catalytic activity, to achieve the high enantioselectivity, and to expand the substrate scope to 5- and 7-membered beta-ketoesters, whose nickel-catalyzed AAA with allylic alcohols results in low enantioselectivity. On the basis of the kinetics using a catalyst system made of Ni(cod)(2) and (S)-Tol-MeO-BIPHEP, and DFT calculations for the reaction pathway of the AAA reaction mediated by an isolated olefin-coordinated nickel-DPPF complex 4b, we propose a mechanism where protonation of the nitrogen atom of the coordinating allylic amine by beta-ketoester is key to cleaving the C-N bond and delivering a cationic pi-allyl nickel(II) intermediate.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500046

The cationic Ru-H complex 1 was found to be an effective catalyst for mediating the coupling reaction of 1,2-disubstituted indoles with alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, in which the regioselective C-alpha-C-beta activation of the carbonyl substrates has been achieved in forming the 3-alkylindole products. The analogous coupling reaction of indoles with saturated aldehydes and ketones directly led to the C-alpha- C-beta cleavage of the carbonyl substrates in forming the 3-allcylindole products. The coupling reaction of 1,2-dimethylinole with (E)-3-nonen-2-one and 2-propanol-d(8) showed 20-22% of deuterium incorporation to both alpha- and beta-CH2 of the 3-alkylindole product. The coupling reaction of 1,2-dimethylinole with (E)-3-nonen-2-one exhibited the most significant carbon kinetic isotope effect on the alpha-carbon of the product (C-alpha = 1.046). The Hammett plot constructed from the reaction of 1,2-dimethylinole with a series of para-substituted enones p-X-C6H4CH=CHCOCH3 (X = OMe, Me, H, Cl, CF3) showed a modest promotional effect by an electron-donating group (rho = -0.2 +/- 0.1). Several catalytically relevant Ru-H species were detected by NMR from a stoichiometric reaction mixture of the Ru-H complex 1 with 1,2-dimethylindole and (E)-3-nonen-2-one in CD2Cl2. These results support a mechanism of the catalytic coupling reaction via conjugate addition of indoles to enones followed by the C-C bond activation and hydrogenolysis steps.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500049

Here, we designed a core-shell-structured SAEC (Co-1-SAC) with superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Co-1-SAC consists of a locally engineered single Co-N3C1 site on a N-doped microporous amorphous carbon support enveloped by a globally engineered highly conductive mesoporous graphitic carbon shell. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co-N3C1 exhibits near-Fermi electronic states distinct from those of Co-N2C2 and Co-N-4, which facilitate both the electronic hybridization with O-2 and the subsequent protonation of adsorbed O-2* toward the formation of OOH*. Engineering Co-N3C1-SAC into a micro/mesoporous structure dramatically enhances the mass transport and electron transfer, which further boosts the ORR and Zn-air battery performance (slightly outperforming Pt/C). Our findings open an avenue toward engineering of the local and global environment of SACs for a wide range of efficient electrochemical conversions.									37	0	0	0	4	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500050

The enhancement arises from the higher atomic concentration of electrochemically active Pd exposed on the surface of the nanoparticles as a result of the electrochemical dealloying process, which was verified by electron energy loss spectroscopy elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and CO stripping. These dealloyed catalysts also showed a negligible decrease in the ORR activity after 4000 potential cycles in alkaline media. In addition, after the degradation that resulted from extended potential cycles in alkaline media, the ORR activity of the catalysts could be restored by repeating the dealloying procedures, with only a 14 mV decrease in the half-wave potential after 16,000 cycles for dealloyed PdNi/C. Similar results were obtained for PdMn/C. These findings provide insights for the rational design of the composition and structure of electrocatalysts with higher atomic utilization of active materials and enhanced electrocatalytic activity, based on postsynthesis modification methods.									20	1	0	0	1	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500052

However, when molecules, such as nitroaromatics, with several reducible functionalities, are hydrogenated, Pd, like any other very active metal, such as nickel or platinum, often behaves unselectively. One strategy to render Pd more selective is to choose the proper support. Herein, we show that MAX phase powders of Ti3SiC2, Ti2AlC, or Ti3AlC2 can chemoselectively hydrogenate 4-nitrostyrene to 4-aminostyrene, with 100% selectivity, at around 3-4% conversion. To boost the latter, we loaded Ti3SiC2 with 0.0005 wt % Pd and increased the conversion to 100% while maintaining the 4-AS selectivity at >90%. By optimizing the Pd loading, we were also able to increase the turnover frequency 100-fold relative to previous literature results. The identification of this highly efficient and chemoselective system has broad implications for the design of cost-effective, earth-abundant, nontoxic, metal catalysts, with ultralow noble metal loadings.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500053

Most organic molecules, however, are colorless and require photo-catalysts absorbing in the visible spectral region for transferring the required energy and charges. The electrochemical potentials of a photocatalyst, along with its optical excitation energy, guide its selection for driving oxidative or reductive reactions. Such selection criteria, however, frequently undermine the complexity of the transformations and prove limiting. Herein, we demonstrate how electron-rich and electron-deficient photoredox catalysts, with distinctly different reduction potentials, successfully drive the same reaction with similarly good yields. The analysis reveals that the large differences between the optical and electrochemical frontier-orbital energy gaps cause switching between two parallel reaction pathways-oxidative versus reductive quenching. This finding demonstrates a paradigm where reaction mechanism adjusts to the electronic properties of catalysts and opens doors for diversifying and broadening of the applicability of photochemical transformations.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500055

Alloying Pd with other metals and using acid and halide promoters are commonly employed to increase H2O2 selectivity; however, the sites that can selectively produce H2O2 have not been identified and the role of these additives remains unclear. Here, we report the synthesis of atomically dispersed PdClx/C as a model catalyst for H2O2 production without the presence of extended Pd surfaces. We show that these isolated cationic Pd sites can form H2O2 with significantly higher selectivity than metallic Pd nanoparticles in both the reaction of H-2 and O-2 and the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. These results demonstrate that catalysts containing high populations of isolated Pd sites are selective catalysts for this two-electron reduction reaction and that the performance of materials in the direct synthesis reaction and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction has many similarities.									14	1	0	0	3	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500056

Here, taking bismuth tantalum oxyhalogen (Bi4TaO8X) as an example, we unraveled a commonly overlooked phenomenon of photoinduced surface activation, in which the intrinsic active sites generated and dominated the enhanced photocatalytic activity under reaction conditions. We demonstrated that a thin layer of amorphous tantalum oxides species was in situ generated on the surface of the Bi4TaO8X photocatalyst at the initial stage of the photocatalytic reaction, and such amorphous species were proven to be the active sites which can significantly facilitate the photocatalytic water-splitting reactions. The investigation focusing on photoinduced surface activation of photocatalysts under the reaction conditions not only unravels the reactive states of semiconductor photocatalysts but also sheds light on the understanding of photocatalytic mechanisms.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500058

However, it is still challenging to monitor and understand an MOF environment-related activity for an enzyme. Here, we developed a MOFs-in-nanochannels configuration for broadening the biocatalytic activity of an enzyme in MOFs on demand. ZIF-8 [Zn(mim)(2), Hmim = 2-methylimidazolated] grown in TiO2 nanochannels is used as the platform, and cytochrome C (CytC) is used as a model enzyme encapsulated in ZIF-8. The enzymatic catalytic process converts 2,2% azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) to a positively charged product (ABTS(+)). On the basis of current-voltage properties, the change of ion transport characteristics in nanochannels can be monitored with time. The ZIF-8 encapsulating CytC molecules not only exhibit a significantly enhanced enzymatic activity in a wide temperature region (37-80 degrees C) but also have remarkably long storage stability at room temperature. The results of quantum mechanical calculation indicate that the Fe-S bond of CytC is inclined to break in the environment of ZIF-8 owing to the confinement effect of the MOF structure, favorable for enzymatic catalysis. The MOFs-in-nanochannel configuration provides an innovative and label-free design for the onsite monitoring of catalytic activity of an enzyme in MOFs, which holds great potential in constructing biosensing platforms with remarkable performance and stability.									20	1	0	0	10	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500059

The key feature involves the photochemical oxidation of an organocobalt(III) intermediate derived from hydrogen atom transfer, which is supported by electrochemical analysis, quenching studies, and stoichiometric experiments. This redox process enables the efficient branch-selective alkylation of pharmaceutically important nucleophiles (phenols, sulfonamides, and various N-heterocycles) using a wide range of alkenes including moderately electron-deficient ones. Moreover, light-gated polar functionalization via organocobalt species was demonstrated.									14	2	0	0	5	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800016

However, as protein motions span a broad range of time and length scales, it is often challenging to identify and thus link functionally relevant dynamic changes to electron transfer in proteins. It is hypothesized that large-scale domain motions direct electrons through a FAD and a heme b cofactor of the fungal cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) enzymes to the type-II copper center (T2Cu) of the polysaccharide-degrading lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). However, as of yet, domain motions in CDH have not been linked formally to enzyme-catalyzed electron transfer reactions. The detailed structural features of CDH, which govern the functional conformational landscapes of the enzyme, have only been partially resolved. Here, we use a combination of pressure, viscosity, ionic strength, and temperature perturbation stopped-flow studies to probe the conformational landscape associated with the electron transfer reactions of CDH. Through the use of molecular dynamics simulations, potentiometry, and stopped-flow spectroscopy, we investigated how a conserved Tyr99 residue plays a key role in shaping the conformational landscapes for both the interdomain electron transfer reactions of CDH (from FAD to heme) and the delivery of electrons from the reduced heme cofactor to the LPMO T2Cu. Our studies show how motions gate the electron transfer within CDH and from CDH to LPMO and illustrate the conformational landscape for interdomain and interprotein electron transfer in this extracellular fungal electron transfer chain.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800001	32382450

Here, we study the catalytic properties of tailored Cu nanocatalysts under commercially relevant current densities in a gas-fed flow cell. We demonstrate that their facet-dependent selectivity is retained in this device configuration with the advantage of further suppressing hydrogen production and increasing the faradaic efficiencies toward the CO2 reduction products compared to a conventional H-cell. The combined catalyst and system effects result in stateof-the art product selectivity at high current densities (in the range 100-300 mA/cm(2)) and at relatively low applied potential (as low as -0.65 V vs RHE). Cu cubes reach an ethylene selectivity of up to 57% with a corresponding mass activity of 700 mA/mg, and Cu octahedra reach a methane selectivity of up to 51% with a corresponding mass activity of 1.45 A/mg in 1 M KOH.									84	1	0	0	6	0	84			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800002	32391186

Here, we performed multilayer engineering of enzyme cascade catalysis to produce C11 nylon monomers at commercially viable concentrations from ricinoleic acid. The catalysis was driven by engineered Escherichia coli-based whole-cell biocatalysts and cell-free enzymes (i.e., lipases). Stabilities and activities of the biocatalysts were improved by engineering the bottleneck enzyme Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase and introducing a cofactor regeneration system. The inhibitory effects of the byproducts n-heptanoic acid and pyruvate on the cascade enzymes were overcome, and the products were simply recovered in situ by engineering of reactions with the addition of an adsorbent resin. We obtained 248 mM undecanedioic acid or 232 mM 11-aminoundecanoic acid as a nylon monomer from 300 mM ricinoleic acid by multilayer engineering. The concentration was 500- and 640-fold higher than those produced by nonengineering, respectively. We have also simply isolated the C11 nylon monomers via solvent extraction to a rather high purity. This study will contribute to the industrial enzyme cascade synthesis of nylon monomers in an environmentally-friendly route from renewable biomass.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800004

One of the best methods to store surplus energy produced from environmentally friendly methods is as elemental hydrogen, using electrolysis in alkaline electrolyzers. Currently, this technology is hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which limits its overall efficiency and durability. One of the most popular directions is to develop cheap, durable, and active platinum-group-metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts. In this category, the benchmark catalyst is NiFeOOH. Here, synthetic, electrochemical, spectro-scopic, and theoretical methods were used to design, synthesize, and investigate novel PGM-free catalysts with enhanced durability and activity. Using an easy and cheap one-step synthetic precipitation method, titanium atoms in various amounts were introduced in the NiFeOOH structure, forming NixFeyTizOOH. One of these compounds (Ni:Fe:Ti = 85.75:7.70:6.55) shows a very low overpotential on GC (400 mV, at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)) and high current density (27.9 mA cm(-2)) at a potential of 1.8 V vs RHE. This is a higher activity toward the OER in comparison to the benchmark catalyst; in addition, the compound has higher stability at prolonged exposure to high potentials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800005

This study not only provides an efficient and modular protocol for the divergent synthesis of propargylic boronic esters and gem-dialkynylalkanes, but also achieves a controllable, single or double cross-coupling of Ni/B bimetallic intermediates. Mechanistic studies reveal that the diboron reagent (B-2 pin(2)) plays a significant role in the dialkynylation reaction, serving as both the reductant and transient assisting group. Notably, both reactions show high regioselectivities and good functional group tolerance. In addition, the synthetic value of the products has been demonstrated with several downstream transformations.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800006

Although catalytic systems based on noble metals have been extensively studied, there has been a growing interest to replace these noble metals with environmentally benign and inexpensive alternatives. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances in catalytic alkyne dimerization, without the use of noble metals.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800007

Here, we put forward a radical relay strategy coupling photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation toward efficiently selective conversion of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD). An illuminated BiVO4 (BVO) photoanode covered with an ultrathin (similar to 3 nm) hydrothermally synthesized layered double hydroxide (U-LDH) catalyst and graphene (G) exhibited >99% selectivity to BAD (1.2 V vs. RHE). Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation verified that the hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) generated from the oxidation of water are bound to the surface of U-LDH through hydrogen-bonding interactions and the energy is lowered. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that BA is adsorbed to the U-LDH catalyst, but BAD is not. Thus, the selectivity is favored not only by the controlled oxidation capacity of center dot OH radicals but the desorption of the desired product from the catalyst before further oxidation occurs. This work introduces an alternative PEC way to achieve mild and selective oxidation of BA derivatives based on ternary G@U-LDH@BVO catalysts.									34	1	0	0	3	0	35			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800008

Inspired by the natural nitrogenase, we biomimetically designed an inorganic catalyst, Mo(IV)-doped FeS2, for electroreduction of dinitrogen to ammonia. The Mo(IV) ions favor the adsorption and activation of N-2, while the FeS2 substrate depresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and the two factors jointly endow the catalyst with a high Faraday efficiency of 14.41% at - 0.2 V versus RHE.									26	4	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800009

The semihydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene on the oxygen-defected anatase TiO2 (110) (Ana-Ov) supported Pt-n cluster (n = 1, 2, 4, 8) has been studied by density functional theory calculations corrected by Hubbard-U and aimed to explore the size dependence of both the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculation results indicated that the adsorption strength of C2H2(C2H4) increases when Pt-n cluster size is enlarged, implying the higher catalytic activity with the same trends is a possibility. According to the microkinetic model analysis, the reaction rate of the whole hydrogenation increases with Pt-n size because of the lower hydrogenation barrier, but the selectivity for ethylene decreases because of the higher desorption barrier of ethylene on the contrary, namely a strong structure-sensitive reaction. Besides, as active sites increase along the Pt-n cluster size, the probability of overhydrogenation of ethylene and green oil formation might be increased, which further reduces the selectivity toward ethylene. The relationship of the selectivity and activity with cluster size effect could supply a clue for designing Pt-based catalysts supported by TiO2 with high efficiency in semihydrogenation of acetylene.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800010

Here, we report the aqueous-phase adsorption enthalpies and free energies of phenol, benzaldehyde, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and cyclohexanol on polycrystalline Pt and Rh determined via experimental isotherms and density functional theory modeling. The experimental aqueous heats of adsorption for all organics are similar to 50 to 250 kJ mol(-1) lower than calculated gas-phase heats of adsorption, with a larger decrease for Rh compared with that for Pt. Unlike in gas phase, phenol and other aromatic organics adsorb with similar strength on Pt and Rh in aqueous phase. The similar aqueous adsorption strength of phenol and benzaldehyde on Pt and Rh explains their comparable aqueous-phase hydrogenation activities, which are rate-limited by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood surface reaction. A widely used implicit solvation model largely overpredicts the heats of adsorption for all organics compared with experimental measurements. However, accounting for the enthalpic penalty of displacing multiple water molecules upon organic adsorption using a bond-additivity model gives a much closer agreement between experimental measurements and predicted heats of adsorption. This bond-additivity model explains that the similar adsorption strength of organics on Pt and Rh in aqueous phase is due to the stronger adhesion of water to Rh than that on Pt, which offsets the stronger gas-phase organic adsorption energy on Rh. The data reported herein also provides a valuable resource for benchmarking methods for predicting aqueous-phase adsorption energies of CS/C6 organics on metal surfaces.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800011

First, electrochemical kinetic studies of the structurally rigid [Co(L-L)] complex show that it undergoes a reductive dimerization upon reduction to the Co-I complex. This dimerization is facilitated by the planar geometry of the [Co(L-L)] complex. The dimer structure dissociates after reduction of the ligand, forming a monomer species that is active for CO2 reduction. The reductive dimerization can be sterically prevented either by adding the strong axially coordinating ligand such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) or by distorting the square planarity of the Co geometry by modulating the flexibility of the ligand scaffold. The more flexible [Co(L-RL)] complexes prevent catalyst dimerization and operate with more positive catalytic onset potentials for CO2 reduction compared to the more rigid [Co(L-L)] complex but operate with lower overall activity in the presence of a proton source. CO-binding and inhibition studies provide evidence that the lower activity for CO2 reduction of the more flexible [Co(L-R-L)] complexes compared to [Co(L-L)] is due to CO poisoning because of the stronger binding affinity of the CO product to the flexible [Co(L-R-L)] complexes. This highlights an important trade-off in catalyst design for this class of molecular electrocatalysts: Co bis(pyridylmonoimine) complexes with higher degrees of structural flexibility prevent dimerization and shift the onset of CO2 reduction catalysis to more positive potentials but decrease the maximum activity due to CO product inhibition.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800012

The O-2 evolution activity of CoAl2O4/g-C3N4 from an aqueous solution of AgNO3 under visible light irradiation was similar to 10 times that of unmodified g-C3N4 and also exceeded that of an analogue modified with a well-known Co3O4 cocatalyst for each optimal preparation condition. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the CoAl2O4 cocatalyst with Co2+ as the main cobalt species at the A site of the spinel possessed better hole-capturing properties than the Co3O4 cocatalyst, which was the main reason for the improved water-oxidation performance.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800013

To make a photocatalyst and an enzyme act concertedly, nicotinamide-based cofactors have been widely used as an electron carrier. However, these cofactors are easily oxidized into an enzymatically inactive form by photo-generated holes. Herein, the oxidation mechanism of NADH, one typical nicotinamide-based cofactor, by photogenerated holes was reported. With CdS, g-C3N4, and BiVO4 as hole generators, NADH is oxidized into NAD(+) or fragmented into ADP-ribose derivatives through a multistep electron transfer. Importantly, the fragmentation reaction is inhibited with dopamine and neutral red to coordinate electron transfer between NADH and photo-generated holes.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800014

Enzymes that form complex structural elements with multiple stereocenters, like chiral saturated oxygen heterocycles (CSOH), are of particular interest for a synthetic application, as their use promises to significantly simplify access to these elements. Here, the biocatalytic characterization of AmbDH3, an enzyme that catalyzes intramolecular oxa-Michael addition (IMOMA) is reported. This reaction essentially gives access to various types of CSOH with adjacent stereocenters, but it is not yet part of the repertoire of preparative biocatalysis. An in-depth study on the synthetic utility of AmbDH3 was performed, which made extensive use of complex synthetic precursor surrogates. The enzyme exhibited stability and broad substrate tolerance in in vitro experiments, which was in agreement with the results of molecular modeling. Its selectivity profile enabled kinetic resolution of chiral tetrahydropyrans (THPs) under control of up to four stereocenters. A systematic optimization of the reaction conditions enabled gram-scale conversions yielding preparative amounts of chiral THP. The synthetic utility of AmbDH3 was finally demonstrated by its successful application in the key step of a chemoenzymatic total synthesis to the THP-containing phenylheptanoid (-)-centrolobine. These results highlight the synthetic potential of AmbDH3 and related IMOMA cyclases as a biocatalytic alternative that further develops the available chemical-synthetic IMOMA methodology.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800015

Here, we investigate how electrical resistance (conductivity) of the electrode affects the measured electrocatalytic activity using the hydrogen evolution reaction as a model reaction. We clearly demonstrate the effect of the poor electronic conductivity of MoS2 on the electrochemical performance, as both values of the exchange current density as well as the Tafel slope depend on the level of utilization of the active material and the ohmic losses. A quantitative analysis using the composite electrode model is provided, showing the importance of the experimental conditions and good control of electrode/electrolyte system for the proper evaluation and comparison of electrocatalysts' kinetic parameters.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800017

Here, we report on methanol oxidation catalysis by copper nanoclusters (4-6 and 8-12 nm) incorporated within a HKUST-1 thin film (similar to 100 nm thick) investigated using UHV temperature-programmed desorption methods. In particular, the Cu-HKUST-1 film with 4-6 nm copper clusters selectively oxidizes methanol molecules to formaldehyde, while the Cu-HKUST-1 film (similar to 100 nm thick) with 8-12 nm copper clusters more strongly oxidizes the methanol to generate not only formaldehyde, but also CO2 caused by the formation of formate species. This study demonstrates the potential to control the Cu nanoparticle size during the vacuum deposition of HKUST-1 thin films and how incorporated Cu clusters of different sizes affect the methanol oxidation catalytic activity under vacuum-controlled conditions.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800018

Although the enzyme is known to catalyze the hydroxylation of medium- and long-chain fatty acids at high rates, no definitive physiological function has been associated with this process in the organism other than a possible protective role. We found that P450(BM)(-3) rapidly hydroxylates alkyl sulfates, particularly those with 12-16 carbons (i.e., including dodecyl sulfate), in a similar manner to the fatty acids. The products were characterized as primarily omega-1 hydroxylated alkyl sulfates (plus some omega-2 and omega-3 hydroxylation products), and some further oxidation to dihydroxy and keto derivatives also occurred. Binding of the alkyl sulfates to P450(BM)(-3) converted the iron from the low-spin to high-spin form in a saturable manner, consistent with the catalytic results. Rates of binding decreased as a function of increasing concentration of dodecyl sulfate or the fatty acid myristate. This pattern is consistent with a binding model involving multiple events and with conformational selection (equilibrium of the unbound enzyme prior to binding) instead of an induced fit mechanism. Neither C-H bond-breaking nor product release was found to be rate-limiting in the oxidation of lauric acid. The conformational selection results rationalize some known crystal structures of P450(BM)(-3) and can help explain the flexibility of P450(BM)(-3) and engineered forms in accepting a great variety of substrates.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800019	34327041

Dihydroquinoline products could be isolated as their amide derivatives upon in situ N-protection, thus offering high synthetic utility of the current procedure.

J	Liu, Yanhong; Yang, Yiying; Zhu, Rongxiu; Zhang, Dongju								Computational Clarification of Synergetic Ru-II/Cu-I-Metallaphotoredox Catalysis in C(sp(3))-N Cross-Coupling Reactions of Alkyl Redox-Active Esters with Anilines								ACS CATALYSIS				10	9			5030	5041		10.1021/acscatal.0c00060				MAY 1 2020	2020	The C-N coupling of alkyl electrophiles for amine synthesis is a less-developed area in comparison with that of aryl electrophiles largely because of the difficulty in product-generating C(sp(3))-N reductive elimination. The recent work by Hu et al. (Nat. Catal. 2018, 1, 120-126) developed an effective strategy for the C-N coupling of alkyl redox-active esters with anilines by merging photoredox catalysis and copper catalysis with an oxoacetic acid ligand (LH2). Here, we present a DFT-based computational study to understand how the special dual catalysis works in a cooperative fashion with the assistance of the ligand. Photoredox catalysis is found to occur most possibly through an oxidative quenching mechanism (Ru-II/*Ru-II/Ru-III/Ru-II) with Et3N as the quencher rather than with the experimentally proposed copper complex. Copper catalytic cycle (Cu-I/Cu-II/Cu-III/Cu-I) is predicted to proceed via a Cu-I-oxidation-first pathway instead of the hypothetical aniline-deprotonation-first pathway in the experiment, and the most likely catalytic active species is identified as the (CuLH)-L-I complex. With the Ru-II/Cu-I - metallaphotoredox catalysis, the most feasible mechanism for the C(sp(3))-N cross-coupling involves six steps: (i) generation of cyclohexyl radical (Cy-center dot) via the single electron transfer (SET) from photoexcited *Ru(II )to the complex of redox-active ester with Cu-I, (ii) coordination of aniline to Cu-I center, (iii) Cy-center dot radical addition to Cu-II-center, (iv) SET between Cu-II-cyclohexyl aniline complex and generated Et3N center dot+, (v) deprotonation of aniline, and (vi) reductive elimination of the Cu-III-cyclohexyl amido intermediate to produce the C(sp(3))-N coupling product. The Cu-I-complex is identified to play a dual role in the title reaction, which acts as the promoter in oxidative quenching process and as the catalyst in the copper catalytic cycle.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800021

At the same time, catalysts with nontrivial topological electronic structures have received considerable attention because of their robust topological surface states and high-mobility electrons, which favor the electrons transfer processes in the heterogeneous catalysis reactions. Under the guidance of this theory, excellent catalysts were reported among topological materials. Inspired by the current development of catalyst and topological materials, we tried to extract a pure intrinsic physical parameter, projected Berry phase (PBP), that only depends on the bulk electronic structure. Applying this parameter to the well-known nonmagnetic transition-metal electrocatalysts, we found a linear relationship between PBP and catalytic efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) after considering the symmetry constraint. This can be used as a descriptor for the prediction and designing of promising catalysts for HER, which is realized experimentally in Pt7Cu nanostructures. This work illustrates the importance of the pure bulk band structure effect on electrochemical activities and implies an effective way to understand the mechanism of HER catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800022	32391187

Here, motivated by the demonstrated enhanced chemical activity of MXenes- a class of two-dimensional inorganic materials- toward the adsorption of quite stable molecules such as CO2 and H2O, we use density functional theory including dispersion, to investigate the suitability of such MXene materials to catalyze N-2 dissociation. Results show that MXenes exothermically adsorb N-2 with rather large adsorption energies ranging from -1.11 to -3.45 eV and elongation of the N-2 bond length by similar to 20%, greatly facilitating their dissociation with energy barriers below 1 eV, reaching 0.28 eV in the most favorable studied case of W2N. Microkinetic simulations indicate that the first hydrogenation of adsorbed atomic nitrogen is feasible at low pressures and moderate temperatures, and that the production of NH3 may occur above 800 K on most studied MXenes, in particular, in W2N. These results reinforce the promising capabilities of MXenes to dissociate nitrogen and suggest combining them co-catalytically with Ru nanoparticles to further improve the efficiency of ammonia synthesis.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800023

Besides cyclohexenones, various bioactive enones can also be synthesized from the corresponding saturated ketones under open air conditions in the presence of Pd/Au/CeO2. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that alpha-C-H bond cleavage in the substrates is the turnoverlimiting step of this desaturation reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800024

However, for this process to become industrially relevant, catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity, and stability are required. Here, we explore the potential of metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors for synthesis of Co3O4 -supported In2O3 oxide composites for the direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Stepwise pyrolytic-oxidative decomposition of indium-impregnated ZIF-67(Co) MOFs affords the formation of a nanostructured In2O3 @Co3O4 reticulated shell composite material able to reach a maximum methanol production rate of 0.65 g(MeOH center dot)g(cat)(-1).H-1 with selectivity as high as 87% over 100 h on stream. Textural characteristics of the sacrificial ZIF-67(Co) matrix and In-loading were found to be important variables for optimizing the catalyst performance such as induction time, methanol productivity, and selectivity. The structural investigation on the catalytic system reveals that the catalyst undergoes reorganization under reaction conditions, transforming from Co3O4 with an amorphous In2O3 shell into Co3InC0.75 covered by a layer consisting of a mixture of amorphous CoOx and In2O3 oxides. Structural reorganization is responsible for the observed induction period, while the amorphous mixed cobalt indium oxide shell is responsible for the high methanol yield and selectivity. Additionally, these results demonstrate the tunable performance of MOF-derived In2O3@Co3O4 catalysts as a function of the reaction conditions which allows us to establish a reasonable trade-off between high methanol yield and selectivity in a wide temperature and pressure window.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800025

Based on recent progress on homogeneous thioether ligands for Pd-catalyzed C-H activation reactions, we here develop a scalable metal-organic framework-based heterogeneous single-site catalyst containing S,O-moieties that increase the catalytic activity of Pd(II) for the oxidative alkenylation of arenes. The structure of the Pd@MOF-808-L1 catalyst was characterized in detail via solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the structure of the isolated palladium active sites could be identified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 8.4 h(-1) was reached after 1 h of reaction time, which was 3 times higher than the TOF of standard Pd(OAc)(2), ranking Pd@MOF-808-L1 among the most active heterogeneous catalysts ever reported for the nondirected oxidative alkenylation of arenes. Finally, we showed that the single-site catalyst promotes the oxidative alkenylation of a broad range of electron-rich arenes, and the applicability of this heterogeneous system was demonstrated by the gram-scale synthesis of industrially relevant products.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800026

Here, we present a fundamental study contrasting the cleavage of C-X bonds in ethane, methylamine, methanol, methanethiol, and chloromethane on group 8-11 transition metals (Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Jr, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au) using density functional theory (DFT). Previous kinetic and DFT studies have shown that hydrogenolysis of unsubstituted C-C bonds in alkanes occur via unsaturated intermediates (e.g., *CHCH* for ethane) after a series of quasi-equilibrated dehydrogenation steps that weaken the C-C bond by creating C-metal bonds. However, the effects of the substituent group in CH3XHn on the required degree of unsaturation to cleave the C-X have not been systematically studied and are critical to understanding heteroatom removal. DFT-predicted free energy barriers indicate that the carbon atom in C-X generally cleaves after the removal of 2 H atoms (to form CH*) on group 8-10 metals regardless of the identity of the metal or the heteroatom. Group 11 metals (coinage metals: Cu, Ag, and Au) generally deave the C-X bond in the most H-saturated intermediates with barriers close to thermal activation of C-X in gaseous CH3CHn molecules. The N-leaving group in C-N cleavage depends on the metal identity as it can leave fully dehydrogenated (as N*) on group 8 metals and partially or fully hydrogenated (as NH* or NH2*) on group 9-11 metals. Although O and S are both group 16 elements, C-S bonds always deave to form S* (losing one H), while C-O bonds generally deave to form OH* (without preceding H removal). Cl does not have H atoms to be removed before C-Cl cleavage in CH3Cl, and thus the C atom sacrifices an additional H atom to weaken the C-Cl bond on group 8 metals. This study of heteroatom removal from simple organic molecules is the first step to providing fundamental insights into H-2-based upgrading of more complex organic molecules.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800027

The initial heat of adsorption of Ni vapor decreased with the extent of pre-reduction (x) of CeO2-x(111), showing that stoichiometric ceria adsorbs Ni more strongly than oxygen vacancies. On CeO1.95 (111) at 300 K, the heat dropped quickly with coverage in the first 0.1 ML, attributed to nucleation of Ni clusters on stoichiometric steps, followed by the Ni particles spreading onto less favorable terrace sites. At 100 K, the clusters nucleate on terraces due to slower diffusion. Adsorbed Ni monomers are in the +2 oxidation state, and they bind more strongly by similar to 45 kJ/mol to step sites than terraces. The measured heat of adsorption versus average particle size on terraces is favorably compared to DFT calculations. The Ce 3d XPS line shape showed an increase in Ce3+/Ce(4+ )ratio with Ni coverage, providing the number of electrons donated to ceria per Ni atom. The charge transferred per Ni is initially large but strongly decreases with increasing cluster size for both experiments and DFT, and it shows large differences between clusters at steps versus terraces. This charge is localized on the interfacial Ni and Ce atoms in their atomic layers closest to the interface. This knowledge is crucial to understanding the nature of the active sites on the surface of Ni/CeO2 catalysts, for which metal-oxide interactions play a very important role in the activation of O-H and C-H bonds. The changes in these interactions with Ni particle size (metal loading) and the extent of reduction of ceria help to explain how previously reported catalytic activity and selectivity change with these same structural details.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800028

This has been recently achieved with AuPd nanocatalysts, but the process exhibits accelerated rates of deleterious H2O2 self-decomposition, which results in prohibitive industrial costs. We performed a multivariate analysis of 143 H2O2 decomposition rate measurements reported in the literature to quantify the effect of reaction conditions and catalyst properties in the decomposition of H2O2 at conditions used during methane upgrading. The results show that the reaction is first order in terms of H2O2 concentration and correlates with a larger particle size. The catalytic activity of colloidal AuPd is lower than that of supported AuPd. The effect of methane pressure is practically negligible, which is evidenced by an H2O2 decomposition rate only 42% smaller when the methane pressure is increased more than 6 log-units. Overall, the results indicate that methane oxidation occurs in a significant excess of H2O2 , which contributes to its radical-based self-decomposition. Inhibiting the activity of AuPd nanocatalysts toward H2O2 self-decomposition is key to achieving high H2O2 efficiency use for the oxidation of methane to methanol. This can be done by decreasing the concentration of H2O2 , using smaller AuPd nanocatalysts, increasing the Au/Pd ratio, using colloidal versus supported nanocatalysts, or increasing the pressure of methane in the reactor. The results of this study provide a path for targeted AuPd catalyst optimization for methane upgrading with improved H2O2 decomposition efficiency and high methane oxidation productivity.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800029

The in situ generated V2O3-V8C7/m-V2CTx catalyst undergoes a redox (oxidation-carburization) mechanism that results in attractive reactivity, selectivity (H-2/CO ratio close to unity), and unprecedented stability (negligible formation of coke). The oxy-carbide species (V2O3 and V8C7) growing in situ under reaction conditions decorate the layers of m-V2CTx and provide a better utilization of V sites in such a way that the resulting V2O3-V8C7/m-V2CT(x) catalyst exhibits four times higher activity than its bulk counterparts, V2AlC MAX phase and commercial vanadium carbide (VC). These kinetic findings combined with spectroscopy, microscopy, and isotopic labeling experiments reveal that while dehydrating the pristine m-V2CTx, an oxy-carbide (V2O3-V8C7/m-V2CTx) material is produced which oxidizes further in the presence of CO2 to generate additional V2O3 nanocrystals on the surface and in-between the multilayered structure. These oxide particles are further carburized in situ by reaction with CH4 and transforming into V8C7 nanocrystals. This study provides kinetic, structural, and mechanistic insights into the genesis of m-V2CTx as a selective and coke-resistant catalyst for DRM. We foresee m-V2CTx, and MXenes in general, as promising precursors, supports, and/or catalysts for various other catalytic applications at relatively high temperatures (>= 500 degrees C).									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800030

The recrystallized FER (FER-S1) with its smaller amount of Lewis acidic extraframework AI sites (EFAI) possessed proper number of Bronsted acidic sites in the eight-membered-ring (8-MR) channels in comparison to the pristine FER, which was responsible for an enhanced CO insertion rate to methoxy intermediates formed by dissociated DME molecules by referentially forming acetyl intermediates or to the highly active Bronsted acidic sites. The most active tetrahedral T2 sites with two adjacent AI atoms in the 8-MR channels having next-nearest Al-O-Si-O-Al configurations on the FER-S1 revealed the stronger adsorption of the stably adsorbed DME molecules as confirmed by DFT calculations. FER-S1 containing the proper amounts of Al atoms in the 8-MR with appropriate locations with optimal acidic properties was responsible for its higher activity and stability for the gas-phase carbonylation of DME, where the AI distributions were confirmed by Rietveld refinement XRD analysis, FT-IR, and DFT calculations. In addition, the acidic sites on the outer surfaces and larger cavity including 10-MR channels were responsible for an accelerated formation of aromatic coke precursors.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800031

Previous theoretical study applied the well-established "Norskov-Bligaard" method to screen catalysts for FAD, while some kinetic models for HCOO* and COOH* dehydrogenation involved no extra unoccupied site, which was necessary in some other kinetic models. In the present work, we use FAD as a case study to comprehensively investigate the effects of different kinetic models on the calculated maps for the predictions of the reaction activity and selectivity. The results show that trends of the predicted CO selectivity are significantly different over a series of transition-metal surfaces for two kinetic models, yielding different predictions for catalyst candidates of FAD. Our results call for a close attention to mechanism details in a theoretical catalyst design.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800033

A series of Pt-based alloy catalysts supported on silica (Pt3M/SiO2, where M = Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Pb) were prepared and tested for the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane, which has been an emerging topic in hydrogen carrier/production applications. Nanoparticulate intermetallic Pt3Fe exhibited high catalytic activity and durability. The Pt3Fe catalyst was further modified by substituting a part of the Fe with a series of metals (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Pb) to form a Pt-3(Fe-0.75,M-0.25) pseudobinary alloy. The partial substitution of Fe with Zn to form Pt-3(Fe0.75Zn0.25) resulted in outstandingly high catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability: a 2.7-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) in comparison to that of Pt/SiO2 (the highest H-2 evolution rate ever reported), >99% toluene selectivity (methane concentration <500 ppm), and long-term durability with >99% MCH conversion for at least 50 h. A mechanistic study based on detailed characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the Fe enhanced hydrogenation of CHx species (decoking) and Zn promoted toluene desorption by both ligand and ensemble effects. The adjacency of Pt, Fe, and Zn in at the atomic level allows construction of a multifunctional active site for effective C-H activation, decoking, and toluene desorption.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800034

Herein, this work reports a one-step controllable synthesis of trimetallic NiCoFe-layered double hydroxides (NiCoFe-LDHs) nanosheets (1.36 nm) for both an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and highly selective oxidation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) into value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). For comparison, two sets of bimetallic NiCo- and NiFe-LDHs were similarly synthesized and evaluated. In the OER process, the optimal NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets exhibited the lowest necessary overpotential (288 mV) to reach 10 mA cm (-2) and the smallest Tafel slope of 92 mV dec(-1) compared with NiCo-LDHs (347 mV, 115 mV dec(-1)) and NiFe-LDHs (303 mV, 108 mV dec(-1)). The performance was also superior to most previously reported LDHs catalysts. Additionally, NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets exhibited a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 1.0 Omega and a larger C-dl value of 2.62 mF cm(-2) compared with NiCo-LDHs (2.1 Omega, 1.94 mF cm(-2)) and NiFe-LDHs (1.4 Omega, 2.22 mF cm(-2)), indicating fast catalytic kinetics. Furthermore, the NiCoFe-LDHs nanosheets possessed excellent durability over 10 h, much better than that of NiCo- and NiFe-LDHs. NiCoFe-LDHs catalysts also exhibited high performance in the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to FDCA, which is a key precursor for the sustainable synthesis of polymers (e.g., polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF)). An ultralow overpotential of 280 mV was required to achieve 20 mA cm(-2), nearly 120 mV less than the activity in pure 1.0 M NaOH. The reaction intermediates and products were qualified by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy system (LC-MS) and LC, where 95.5% conversion of HMF and 84.9% yield of FDCA were obtained in 1 h. The reaction kinetics and possible pathways were further investigated. As a unique report utilizing trimetallic LDHs catalysts for OER and HMFOR, this study provides a promising perspective for energy conversion and electrocatalytic processing of biomass-derived monomers.									61	3	0	0	6	0	63			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800036

This study provides a rationale for the superior efficiency of a gold complex bearing a bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (BiCAAC).

A promising approach involves direct synthesis from molecular hydrogen and oxygen at (sub)ambient temperatures using unmodified supported Pd catalysts, which are limited by low selectivities. Controlling the environment of Pd active sites via surface ligands is shown to enhance selectivity. Trends among a myriad of surface ligands (i.e., phosphines, thiols, weakly bound molecules) suggest that those containing H-bonding groups lead to the highest H2O2 production, potentially by affecting reaction energetics via H-bonding with key intermediates. These insights lay the groundwork for ligand design to achieve the optimal catalyst performance for H2O2 synthesis.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800038

A series of boron-promoted Pt/XB-gamma-Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized, tested, and characterized. The sequential impregnation of 1 wt % boron and 3 wt % platinum decreases the amount of deposited carbon 3-fold, increases the propylene selectivity from 90% to 98%, and enhances the activity after 12 h by 40%. Catalyst characterization and thermodynamic DFT calculations suggest that boron forms a finely dispersed amorphous oxide on the gamma-Al2O3 support and on the platinum particles, modifying both the selectivity of the metal sites and the strength and number of acid sites on the support.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800039

Despite extensive investigation, there remains uncertainty about NO reduction mechanisms. Particularly, it is unknown which sites are responsible for the unselective reduction of NO to NH3 under light-off conditions or in CO-rich feed. By varying Rh catalyst structure from atomically dispersed species to clusters on Al2O3 and CeO2, we provide evidence that in the reduction of NO by CO with co-fed H2O, low-temperature NH3 formation occurs on atomically dispersed Rh sites, whereas high-nuclearity Rh clusters are selective to N-2.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800040

Complexes 1, 2, 3a,b, and 4a,b, under the activation of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)(4)] and (AlBu3)-Bu-i, show high activities as well as higher than 96.6% 3,4regioselectivities, of which 1 and 2 are nonstereoselective, giving atactic 3,4-poly(1PB), while 3a,b and 4a,b exhibit distinguished syndioselectivities (>= 95.3% rrrr). However, 3c and 4c are inactive. In addition, complexes 5-7 are also completely inert although they are highly active and cis-1,4-selective for isoprene polymerization. On the contrary, the analogous cis-1,4-selective complex 8 exhibits syndio- (>= 96.1% rrrr) and 3,4-regio- (>99%) selectivity. Hydrogenation of a syndiotactic 3,4-poly(1PB) affords a syndiotactic poly(4-phenyl-1-butene) elastomer with a T-g of 17 degrees C.

Herein, an ynamide-mediated macrolactonization of seco-acids with the assistance of an acid catalyst is described. Various macrolactones ranging in ring size from medium to large can be prepared by using this method. The notorious issues associated with conventional macrolactonization reactions, such as the racemization/epimerization of seco-acids containing an alpha-chirality center, and the E/Z isomerization of alpha,beta 3-unsaturated seco-acids can be avoided using this method. In addition, the ynamide-mediated two-step macrolactonization reaction can be performed in a one-pot manner, thus offering a user-friendly protocol. Cyclodepsipeptides containing both amide and ester bonds can also be constructed using this method as the key step to facilitate the ring closure. The total synthesis of dehydroxy LI-F04a, which contains a cyclic hexadepsipeptide core, has been accomplished using this method.									16	4	1	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800042

This study provides a proof-of-concept of piezobiocatalysis by demonstrating peroxygenase-catalyzed oxyfunctionalization reactions fueled by piezocatalytically generated H2O2. Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) generated H2O2 in situ via an oxygen reduction reaction under ultrasonic wave conditions. Through the simple combination of water, ultrasound, recombinant, evolved unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO), and BiOCl, the piezobiocatalytic platform accelerated selective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to enantiopure (R)-1-phenylethanol [total turnover number of rAaeUPO (TTNrAaeUPO), 2002; turnover frequency, 77.7 min(-1); >99% enantiomeric excess (ee)]. The BiOCl-rAaeUPO couple also catalyzed other representative substrates (e.g., propylbenzene, 1-chloro-4-ethylbenzene, cyclohexane, and cis-beta-methylstyrene) with high turnover frequency and selectivity. We alleviated the oxidative stress of piezocatalytically generated OH center dot on rAaeUPO by spatial separation of rAaeUPO and BiOCl, which resulted in greatly enhanced TTNrAaeUPO of >3900 and the notable prolongation of reaction time. Overall, the BiOCl-rAaeUPO couple serves as a mechanical-to-chemical energy conversion platform for driving peroxygenase-catalyzed reactions under ultrasonic conditions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800043

Here, by a strategy merging hydrogen transfer and selective coupling, we present a ruthenium-catalyzed deconstruction of N-heteroaromatics to functionalized arylamines with 2-aminoaryl methanols. The reaction is achieved via sequential functionalization of the beta and alpha sites of the initially formed N-heteroarenium salts followed by a C-N cleavage, which proceeds with the striking features of broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity and atom efficiency, and suitability for a streamlined synthesis of some biomedical molecules. The strategy utilized will pave the way for further development of catalytic transformations of inert organo systems to functional frameworks.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800044

However, the hydrogen release rate from these chemicals is limited by the intrinsic catalytic activity of metal catalysts, which can be enhanced by light irradiation. Here, nanohybrids including a core of plasmonic TiN and multiple Pt nanocrystal catalytic centers are assembled and show, under resonant conditions at 700 nm, hot electron-driven hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane at an apparent quantum yield of 120%. It is also demonstrated that solar irradiation enhances the activity of TiN-Pt nanohybrids by one order of magnitude through two synergistic mechanisms: hot electrons and collective-heating contributions. Using the microscopic calculation of the photo-induced temperature around a single nanocrystal, it is revealed that the collective plasmonic heating regime dominates the macroscopic temperature distribution in the system. The presented data show that plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal heating can be used in synergy to trigger hydrogen release from ammonia borane on demand, providing a general strategy for greatly enhancing the activity of metal catalysts in the dark.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800046

Here we report a one-step, low-temperature, plasma-enhanced catalytic process for direct SO2 reduction to elemental sulfur in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) packed bed reactor. Coupling nonthermal plasma with supported iron sulfide catalyst dramatically promotes SO2 reduction at low temperatures, enhancing SO2 conversion by 200% and 100% using H-2 and CH4, respectively. Interestingly, under plasma conditions, the supported zinc sulfide catalyst showed high SO(2 )reduction activity, although it is thermally inactive even at higher temperatures. The possible origin of these synergetic effects as well as plasma influence on SO2 adsorption are discussed.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800047

In this work, we utilized in situ neutron and infrared vibration spectroscopy to show the catalytic role of cerium hydride (Ce-H) and hydroxyl (OH) groups in acetylene hydrogenation over ceria surfaces with different degree of reduction. In situ inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy (INS) proved that not only Ce-H but also surface atomic hydrogen species on the reduced ceria surface can participate in acetylene semihydrogenation. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results implied that bridging OH groups both on the oxidized and reduced ceria are active in the selective hydrogenation of acetylene. It appears that surface Ce-H is more reactive than the coexisting OH species on the reduced ceria surface, but over-reduction of ceria also results in strongly bound species that may lead to catalyst deactivation. These spectroscopic results clearly explain the reaction mechanism including not only the surface chemistry but also the nature of the active hydrogen species for selective hydrogenation over ceria, providing insights into the design of more active and stable ceria-based catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800048

We found that water seriously decreased the conversion of ethene and the yield of aromatics, suppressed the hydrogen transfer reaction, and changed the distribution of aromatics at low reaction temperature (300 degrees C). However, the effect of water became relatively insignificant with an increase in the reaction temperature. Characterization by TGA, in situ FTIR, and GC-MS and a simulation with DFT validated that the cofed water preferentially adsorbs at the Bronsted acid site (BAS) of the H-ZSM-5 catalysts, in comparison to ethene, leading to the formation of Z-OH center dot center dot center dot H2O hydrogen-bonded complexes and H+(H2O)(n) species. These species inside the channel of the zeolite inhibit the oligomerization of ethene, the olefin-induced hydrogen transfer reaction, and running of the hydrocarbon pool inside zeolite channels. We also validated that the conversion of ethene was recovered when the majority of H2O was desorbed from BAS, while the propagation of the HCP mechanism within HZSM-5 was still altered at higher temperature as a result of a physically adsorbed water-enhanced confinement effect in the channels. In addition, the role of water on the suppression of the amount of coke was investigated in detail.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800049

Here we report on the simple and readily synthetically accessible cis-[Ru(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)(H2O)(2)](2+) (1) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, 5,5'-dcbpy = 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid) water oxidation catalyst. Its O-2 evolution has first-order dependence on the catalyst following the water nucleophilic attack mechanism. The cis-[Ru-V = O,-OH(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)](2+) intermediate was detected in the reaction mixtures by X-ray absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy in agreement with the proposed mechanism and DFT calculations. To avoid a deactivating dimerization, the catalyst was postsynthetically incorporated into the UIO-67 metal-organic framework with retention of water oxidation activity. Similar results were obtained via the incorporation of cis-[Ru(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)]Cl-2, a chemical precursor of 1, to UIO-67 followed by hydrolysis. Postsynthetic doping of the UIO-67 thin film on a FTO glass electrode with 1 leads to an increase of the catalytic current by two orders of magnitude. Thus, [Ru(bpy)(5,5'-dcbpy)(H2O)(2)](2+)-UIO-67 is a promising building block for integrated photosynthetic systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800050

Hence, it is critical to understand the atomic structures and properties of sub-nanometer metal oxide clusters under a reactive gas environment, such as O-2 . We consider here experimentally accessible precise-size Cu clusters (Cu-4) supported on partially hydroxylated amorphous alumina and show that such clusters can access, in catalytic conditions at high temperature under a pressure of O-2, a large ensemble of oxidized structures, representing a large variety of oxygen content, of geometries in link with the support, and of catalytic activities for oxidation reactions, as seen from their reducibilities. A grand canonical basin hopping method based on first-principles energy reveals an ensemble of 24 configurations for the Cu4Ox cluster of low free energy, less than 0.8 eV above the global minimum. The low free energy ensemble consists of clusters of different stoichiometries, which are mainly Cu4O3 and Cu4O4 in the temperature range of 200-400 degrees C and under a pressure of 0.5 bar of O-2. The presence of several competitive isomers at each composition implies that cluster fluxionality impacts the phase diagram, which should be ensemble-averaged. In terms of catalytic oxidation activity, Cu4O3 isomers present highly variable O abstraction energy: the most stable isomers are inactive for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation, but isomerization to metastable isomers, that proceed with low barrier, enable to create active configurations with low O abstraction energy. O atoms with the lowest anionic character, and thus of more electrophilic nature, present the best oxidation capability. In contrast, all Cu4O4 isomers show a low O abstraction energy and a high potential catalytic activity. This manuscript demonstrates the unique structural and electronic properties of sub-nano Cu oxide clusters and illustrates the critical roles of configuration ensembles and rearrangement to highly reactive metastable cluster isomers in nanocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800051

Chem. 2017, 9, 629-634). The mechanism, reactivity, and stereoselectivity of this reaction were studied by quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical (MM) calculations in this work. To understand better the origin of such an excellent catalytic performance of biocatalyst P411(CHA)', iron-cofactor FePIX alone for the intermolecular C-H bond amination was also theoretically investigated as a comparison. The catalytic cycle includes two processes: N-2 dissociation and nitrene transfer. The calculation results show that P411(CHA)' enzyme can catalyze intermolecular C-H amination with high reactivity and stereoselectivity, whereas the FePIX-catalyzed reaction has much higher barriers for both N-2 dissociation and nitrene transfer compared to P411(CHA)'. The reason for this dramatic difference in catalytic reactivity between P411(CHA)' and FePIX is that the former but not the latter allows the formation of precursors B-(5)PR1 and B-(3)PR2, which are structurally close to transition states B-(3)TS1 and B-(3)TS2 and accelerate N-2 dissociation and nitrene transfer, respectively. The mutated residues (A82L A78V F263L) assist the formations of B-(5)PR1 and B-(3)PR2 via reducing effectively the size of the haem distal pocket. High stereoselectivity of P411(CHA)' stems from the steric effect in H-abstraction. A theoretical analysis on how para substituent R affects reactivity was also carried out.

The atomic-level details of the splicing mechanism and the role of the entwined protein-RNA environment during catalysis remain unresolved. Here, quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations along with thermodynamic integration unveil that the second catalytic (exon-ligation) step occurs via an associative two-Mg2+-ion mechanism, exclusively catalyzed by RNA, with the scissile phosphate mediating a proton transfer from the nucleophile to the leaving group. Our outcomes provide fundamental advances in understanding the splicing mechanism in eukaryotes disclosing how the catalytic core of spliceosome's ancestors self-splicing ribozymes remained conserved during evolution.									8	0	1	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800053

This metal-free process does not require the use of any external photocatalyst, as it is catalyzed by a simple diamine which, upon condensation with an enone substrate, forms an iminium ion intermediate that absorbs in the visible light region. The direct excitation of such an intermediate leads to a charge transfer (CT) excited state that unlocks a stereocontrolled intermolecular photocycloaddition with good enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric ratios and high yields. Finally, DFT calculations and experiments were performed to support the charge transfer behavior and the mechanistic proposal.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800054

Although various catalysts exhibit selective activity for FA decomposition, no active phase has been reported to be effective for both simultaneously. In this work, the FA decompositions over the bulk gamma-Mo2N and the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)supported gamma-Mo2N catalysts were investigated in detail. It is found that both catalysts showed obvious activity at low temperatures (100-200 degrees C). Interestingly, the reaction pathway was almost completely transformed from the selective dehydration over the bulk gamma-Mo2N to the selective dehydrogenation over the NC-supported gamma-Mo2N. Moreover, stable FA decomposition performances were observed with these two catalysts during the 45 h tests. The apparent transformation of the decomposition pathway could be ascribed to the acid- base properties of catalysts with different exposure facets. That is, the dehydration was favored by the acidic bulk gamma-Mo2N with a preferential exposure facet of (111), whereas the dehydrogenation was benefited from the strong basic property of the NC-supported gamma-Mo2N catalyst with the favorable exposed plane of (200).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800056

Conventional PROX catalysts are usually a platinum group or Au-based. However, low-cost PROX catalysts with high CO conversion and a wide operating temperature window are rare. Here, we design a PROX catalyst by harnessing the electronic atomic monolayer-metal support interaction between a single layer 2-D material and a metallic support. O-2 is physiosorbed on nitrogen-doped graphene, while it adsorbs highly activated on Ni(111)-supported nitrogen-doped graphene where the O-O bond can dissociate readily. The adsorbed atomic oxygen can subsequently react with CO or H-2. The proposed catalyst is expected to maintain its activity in the presence of water. Microkinetic modeling results suggest that the turnover frequency of O-2 consumption with a CO partial pressure of 0.01 bar is over 2/s at room temperature and the selectivity to CO(2 )is similar to 100%. As an oxidation catalyst, Ni(111)-supported nitrogen-doped graphene is predicted to be also highly active for ethylene epoxidation at 423 K. Thus, the present study suggests a direction for the design of various selective oxidation catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800057

Here, we explore the role of geometric and acid-base properties in the mechanism of aldol condensation catalyzed by ceria nanoshapes. In the crucial C-C coupling step, the two carbonyl adsorbates are bound to two adjacent cations. On the CeO2(110) plane, all atoms lie on the same layer, favoring the interaction between adsorbates and facilitating the bimolecular C-C coupling. Thus, the initial unimolecular deprotonation is rate-limiting. In contrast, the (100) and (111) planes have an open structure with O on the top layer and Ce on the layer below. The former O layer interferes between adsorbates linked to Ce sites, making the C-C coupling rate-limiting. Water helps in overcoming this spatial hindrance by remote bond polarization via H-bonds. Therefore, water promotion is only observed on those planes for which the bimolecular step is rate-limiting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000530090800060

In this study, we demonstrate that the commercially available organoborane reagent 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (H-B- 9-BBN) can serve as a catalyst for the sequential double hydroboration of alkynes using pinacolborane (HBpin). This strategy, which is effective for a wide range of terminal alkynes, is predicated upon a key C(sp(3))-B/B-H transborylation reaction. Transition-state thermodynamic parameters and 10-boron-isotopic labeling experiments are indicative of a sigma-bond metathesis exchange pathway.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400022

In contrast to previously reported sulfoxide-chelated ruthenium benzylidenes, this complex is more stable in a cis-dichloro conformation and is thus latent in typical olefin metathesis reactions. The complex was characterized by NMR, UV-vis, and X-ray spectroscopy, alongside density functional theory computations. The latent precatalyst could be activated thermally and, depending on the solvent, by UV-C or visible light. In addition, an original "thermo-chromatic" orthogonal sequence was developed, further improved by the use of a thioether chelated complex, where a divergent two-step synthesis can lead to a dihydrofuran or a dihydropyran depending only on the order by which the different stimuli, heat or light, are applied.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400037

Our calculations revealed that unlike other alkenes, allylic alcohols can bind the Ti center after activation of the precatalyst via hydrolysis to give the corresponding Ti-alcoholate, which is the catalyst resting state. Next, the dissociative addition of hydrogen peroxide to Ti causes the cleavage of a Ti-OSi junction to form a Ti(eta(2)-OOH) moiety. The partial detachment of the Ti from the catalyst structure yields an intermediate with a flexible Ti center from which the Ti-OOH group can transfer an electrophilic oxygen to the alkene substrate in an inner-sphere fashion. The rate-determining process, which involves the heterolytic activation of H2O2 over the Ti(IV) and the electrophilic O-transfer, accounts for an overall free-energy barrier of 23.0 kcal mol(-1) for 2-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, in line with the experimental value of 22.3. Conversely, the outer-sphere 0-transfer-also accessible to nonfunctionalized alkenes-occurs through a more strained transition state that lays above in energy (by similar to 4 kcal mol(-1)), giving a clue to explain the low yields reported experimentally for nonfunctionalized olefins. We also found that reducing the bulkiness of the substituents in the silanol functions of the catalyst has a positive influence on the catalytic activity, decreasing the overall free-energy barriers for the outer-sphere path. With this knowledge, we developed other catalytic species with tailored steric properties based on [SbW9O33(RSiOH)(3)](3-) structure (R =Pr-i and Pr-n), which were synthesized, characterized, and successfully applied to the catalytic epoxidation of unfunctionalized alkenes. Present results clearly show that the detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms, even for complex processes, is possible nowadays and that the acquired information allows designing catalysts with desired activities.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400028

However, the mechanisms of silver-catalyzed redox reactions are generally still poorly understood, including a near-total lack of data on oxidized intermediates. Here, we present a detailed experimental study on the oxidation of a dinuclear silver(I) nitrene transfer catalyst with commonly used hypervalent iodine oxidants (PhINSO2Ar), including structurally characterized examples of silver(II) oxidation products obtained under catalytically relevant conditions. Furthermore, the silver(I) catalyst is shown to undergo stepwise oxidation to silver(II) and silver(III) intermediates; the generation of silver(III) intermediates has not previously been demonstrated in nitrene transfer catalysis. In contrast to prior mechanistic hypotheses, our data indicates that nitrene transfer occurs from silver(III) in this reaction system.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400036

When the resulting anionic charge is delocalized from carbon to an oxygen atom, these deprotonations can be catalytically accelerated by oxyanion stabilization. Oxyanion stabilization by a glutamine side chain (Gln50) was thought to accelerate C-H proton abstraction in HG3.17, a computationally designed biocatalyst that had been evolutionarily optimized to enzyme-like efficiency. We present kinetic data and crystal structures at atomic resolution for six Gln50 mutants that indicate a surprisingly small advantage of the hydrogen-bond donor glutamine over "greasy" methionine. However, tightly packed active sites (Gln, Met, Phe)-greasy or not-perform consistently better than water-filled oxyanion holes found with other substitutions (His, Ser, Ala, Lys). Although oxyanion stabilization appears to contribute modestly to HG3.17 efficiency, the role of Gln50 is mechanistically more complex than initially thought, underscoring the importance of multifactorial approaches for the design of enzymatic oxyanion holes in the future.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400001

CO2 to CO is a promising way for using carbon resources because CO is one component of syngas for the production of many important synthesis intermediates such as dimethyl oxalate (DMO). Hydrogenation of DMO provides an economical and eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of methyl glycolate, ethylene glycol (EG), and ethanol, which is often determined by the reaction conditions and catalysts with different active sites. Thus, DMO or EG is also an important carbon carrier or CO2 utilization product. Also, DMO hydrogenation is a representative reaction for studying the structure-activity relationship in C=O/C-O bond hydrogenation. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive review of the progress in DMO hydrogenation from the perspective of constructing and stabilizing the active sites. The silver and copper based catalysts with different structures and morphologies used for DMO hydrogenation have been discussed with regard to their catalytic performance and reaction mechanism. The synergy of Cu-0 and Cu+ in DMO hydrogenation has been questioned, and new active sites are proposed with more experimental evidence. New reaction routes, hybrid active sites, and the effect of catalyst structure on the active sites for DMO hydrogenation have been achieved and reviewed. Moreover, a strategy of introducing organic additives to improve EG yield and stabilize copper species has been described. This work may help advance the understanding of active sites in DMO hydrogenation and guide the future rational design and fabrication of highly stable and low-cost DMO hydrogenation catalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400002

However, much remains unknown regarding the structures, substrate scopes, and mechanisms of many of the enzymes involved in BIA biosynthesis, which hampers efforts toward engineering these enzymes to produce alternative products or act in non-native biosynthetic contexts. Here, we present multiple crystal structures of two scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase (S9OMT) variants from Thalictrum flavum which catalyze an essential step in the biosynthesis of berberine. The crystal structures revealed the structural basis for substrate and cofactor recognition by TfS9OMT and provide further insight into the structure and function of S9OMTs. A structural comparison of the TfS9OMT and T. flavum norcoclaurine 6OMT (Tf6OMT) crystal structures identified important residues for enzyme regiospecificity, which were confirmed via mutagenesis and in vitro assays. Several TfS9OMT mutants with expanded substrate scopes toward various 1-benzylisoquinoline substrates were generated. The rationally engineered TfS90MT mutants with altered regiospecificity were tested in a yeast-based scoulerine production platform and enabled de novo production of tetrahydropalmatrubine and tetrahydropalmatine.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400004

However, in situ observation on the formation and evolution of the hydrocarbon pool species at the initial stage is still a huge challenge. In this contribution, experimental and theoretical evidence on the origin and conversion of the methylcyclopentenyl cations (MCP+) were obtained directly at the initial period of the MTH reaction. In situ solid-state NMR spectroscopies revealed that MCP+ was formed preferentially than polymethylbenzenes (PMBs) species when the HCP species began to accumulate at the transition stage. Additionally, the relationship between MCP+ and PMBs species was established by C-13-isotope tracing experiments and theoretical calculations. Importantly, this contribution highlights the importance of the MCP+ species in the whole methanol conversion process. Besides acting as an important active intermediate species for formation of olefins at the steady-state stage, MCP+ species play a crucial role in bridging the direct mechanism at the inefficient initial stage and the highly efficient steady-state stage following the indirect pathway for methanol conversion.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400005

We have now elucidated the mechanistic basis of its distinct catalytic profile by density functional theory calculations and experimental studies. Activation of the catalyst proceeds intramolecularly, giving rise to a dinuclear complex composed of a reactive palladium hydride and an inert palladacycle. This complex mediates double bond migrations with an energy span of 9.5 kcal/mol, which is well below those calculated for known catalysts. Its dissociation leads to an even more active monophosphinopalladium hydride catalyst and an inert dinuclear bispalladacycle. In the main deactivation pathway, two mononuclear Pd species react with each other, liberating a hydrogenation product and regenerating the catalyst precursor [Pd](I)(mu-Br)(Bu3P)-Bu-t](2). The experimentally observed buildup of dinuclear palladacycles during the catalysis is, thus, the result of conversion of a binuclear into mononuclear Pd-H catalyst. Phosphines, which would deactivate metathesis cocatalysts, are not liberated at any stage. This explains the unique suitability of [Pd](I)(mu-Br)(Bu3P)-Bu-t](2) for isomerizing metatheses. The mechanistic insights were used for the in silico casting of a catalyst generation, targeting complexes with a reduced barrier toward the formation of dinuclear Pd-H species, a low energy span of the catalytic cycles, and increased barriers either toward deactivation or, alternatively, toward dissociation to short-lived mononuclear complexes. Complexes with bisadamantyl-n-butylphosphine ligands were identified as lead structures. Experimental studies with model catalysts confirmed the validity of the predicted structure-activity relationship.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400006

Herein, we have developed copper-based catalysts confined within a rationally designed covalent triazine framework (CTF-B), featuring a CuN2Cl2 structure, for selective CO2RR to hydrocarbons with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.3% and an FE of C2H4 up to 30.6%. Operando X-ray adsorption fine structure analyses reveal the potential-driven dynamic formation of Cu atomic clusters, together with the time-dependent and Cu-content-dependent CO2RR performance associated with the catalyst activation, definitively uncovering that the aggregated Cu clusters confined within CTF-B are the active sites. A further probing experiment of CO electroreduction not only verifies that CO is one of the key intermediates for the CO2RR but also demonstrates the improved selectivity to C-2 chemicals, with a maximum FE of 68.4% (C2H4, 35.0%; acetate, 33.4%), possibly originating from the accelerative C-C coupling reaction due to the increased CO coverage and enhanced local pH in CO-saturated electrolyte. Interestingly, acetate is identified as the only liquid product, mostly likely benefiting from the dominant low-coordination active sites of confined Cu aggregation and favorable chemical confinement environment of CTF-B. The strategy of constructing efficient metalloelectrocatalysts by means of confinement in a covalent organic framework along with operando identification of active sites sheds light on the rational catalyst design and structure-property relationship.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400007

Mass-selected Pt-n clusters were deposited onto amorphous SiO2/Si(100) to make the PtnSiO2 model catalysts. To produce PtnSnx clusters, size-selected Pt-n was used to seed selective deposition of Sn on Pt via a self-limiting H-2/SnCl4/H-2 reaction sequence. Model catalysts were analyzed using C2D4 and CO temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), lowenergy ion scattering (ISS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), plane wave density functional theory (DFT) global optimization combined with a statistical mechanical description of the catalytic interface, and a DFT mechanistic study. Supported pure Pt-n dusters are found to be highly active toward dehydrogenation of C2D4, quickly deactivating due to a combination of carbon deposition and sintering, resulting in loss of accessible Pt sites. Addition of Sn to Pt-n dusters results in the complete suppression of C2D4 dehydrogenation and carbon deposition and also stabilizes the dusters against thermal sintering. Theory shows that both systems have thermal access to a multitude of cluster structures and adsorbate configurations that form a statistical ensemble. While Pt-4/SiO2 clusters bind ethylene in both di-sigma- and pi-bonded configurations, Pt4Sn3/SiO2 binds C2H4 only in the pi-mode, with di-sigma- bonding suppressed by a combination of electronic and geometric features of the PtSn clusters. Dehydrogenation reaction profiles on the accessible cluster isomers were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. Dehydrogenation of di-sigma-bound ethylene is computed to dominate and is suppressed by Sn addition, in agreement with the experiments. DFT indicates that, after Sn alloying, the barrier for ethane-to-ethylene conversion is lower than that for unwanted ethylene dehydrogenation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400008

Catalysts were synthesized by the grafting of Cp2ZrCl2 on the surface of amorphous silica. The connectivity of Zr was characterized by XRD, UV-vis, and Raman spectroscopy. For the lowest Zr loading, Zr is present predominantly as isolated monomeric species. As the Zr loading is increased, a progressively larger fraction of Zr forms oligomeric species and ZrO2 nanoparticles. Measurements of catalytic activity show that the turnover frequency for carboxylic acid ketonic decarboxylation reaction and aldol condensation of ketones decreases monotonically with increasing Zr loading. An H/D kinetic isotope effect was not observed over isolated Zr catalysts, suggesting that a-H abstraction is not the rate-determining step, rather C-C bond forming may be rate limiting for both reactions. This conclusion is supported by computational modeling of the reaction mechanism. The proposed catalytic cycle for ketonization proceeds via a beta-keto acid intermediate on isolated Zr sites that are always coordinatively saturated with C-C bond formation as the rate-limiting step. C-C bond formation is also rate-determining for aldol condensation, with an apparent activation energy that is in good agreement with the experiment if the resting state is a saturated ZrOH site with two adsorbed ketone molecules.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400010

This work provides a computational model for isolated surface WOx sites (doped and undoped) supported on beta-cristobalite (beta-SiO2) and computationally explores their molecular structure, degree of hydration, and energetics over a wide range of OCM-relevant temperatures from 500 to 1300 K. Ab initio thermodynamic analysis showed that the most stable molecular configuration of the surface sites in all cases (WOx, Na-WOx, Mn-WOx) was the digrafted, dioxo pseudotetrahedral WO4. The thermal stability of the surface WO4 sites was in the order Na-WO4 >> WO4 > Mn-WO4 in the OCM-relevant temperature range of 850-1300 K. A spin analysis of an Mn-WO4 isolated surface site indicates a paramagnetic high-spin Mn2+-O-W6+ electronic state, in line with literature reports. The computed frequencies for isolated surface WO4 sites agree well with the experimental in situ Raman spectra of the corresponding model catalysts, proving their existence. Finally, steady-state OCM studies showed that the C-2 selectivity was highest for Na-WO4 sites, followed by Mn-WO4 and WO4, a trend mimicking the degree of distortion in the molecular geometry of each site. Na-WO4 exhibited the lowest reactivity toward CH4 and the highest degree of W=O bond elongation.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400011

This study uses periodic density functional theory (DFT) to examine mechanisms and rates of hydrogenating MTO product alkenes and species formed during MTO that have been linked to catalyst deactivation: C-4 and C-6 dienes, formaldehyde, and benzene. Hydrogenations of these species are examined in models of H-ZSM-S (MFI framework), H-SSZ-13 and H-SAPO-34 (CHA framework). Single-step and two-step hydrogenation mechanisms occur with similar barriers for all reactants on all zeolites, with H-2 dissociation (hydride transfer) being the difficult part of these mechanisms. Hydrogenation barriers trend well with carbenium stabilities, and species that form oxocarbeniums or allylic carbocations hydrogenate at higher rates than those proceeding via alkylcarbeniums. As such, dienes and formaldehyde are selectively hydrogenated during MTO compared to alkenes, occurring with barriers 10-85 kJ mol(-1) lower than C-2-C-4 alkene hydrogenation, with formalde hydehydrogenation on average 10 kJ mol(-1) lower than diene hydrogenation. Butadiene hydrogenation is also facilitated by alpha,delta protonation and hydridation schemes, which form 2-butene as primary products, in contrast to alpha,beta routes forming 1-butene-both routes occur via allylic carbocations, indicating that carbocation stability is not the only driver towards selective diene hydrogenation. Barriers of hexadiene hydrogenation are lower than those of butadiene, indicating that longer carbon chains can stabilize the intermediate carbocations. Benzene, in contrast to dienes and formaldehyde, is hydrogenated with higher barriers than C-2-C-4 alkenes despite proceeding via stable benzenium cations because of the instability of the nonaromatic product. Hydrogenation barriers in H-SSZ-13 and H-ZSM-5 are within 12 kJ mol(-1) of one another indicating both demonstrate similar hydrogenation rates. Hydrogenation barriers in H-SAPO-34 are 12-38 kJ mol(-1) higher than those in H-SSZ-13 (both CHA) and the SAPO zeotype also seems to favor formaldehyde hydrogenation over diene hydrogenation (in contrast to the aluminosilicates). H2O increases the efficacy of H-2 co-feeds but does not directly assist in hydrogenation pathways; instead, it increases hydrogenation rates by increasing the concentration of surface protons through alkyl hydration reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400012		
J	Wang, Hongsen; Yang, Yao; DiSalvo, Francis J.; Abruna, Hector D.								Multifunctional Electrocatalysts: Ru-M (M = Co, Ni, Fe) for Alkaline Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers								ACS CATALYSIS				10	8			4608	4616		10.1021/acscatal.9b05621				APR 17 2020	2020	Moving from proton exchange membrane fuel cells to anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) enables the use of non-Pt-group (NPG) metals as cathodes for the oxygen reduction reaction, since the oxygen reduction kinetics on NPG metals is significantly enhanced in alkaline media. These NPG metal catalysts are also stable under alkaline conditions and cost much less than Pt-group metals. However, in alkaline media, H-2 oxidation on Pt anodes is much more sluggish than in acidic media, and thus, more active H-2 oxidation catalysts are required to enable AEMFCs. Here we report on a family of H-2 oxidation catalysts: Ru alloys with Co, Ni, or Fe. A series of RuCo/C, RuNi/C, and RuFe/C alloy nanoparticle catalysts have been synthesized via an impregnation method and characterized by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. We find that Ru alloys with small amounts of Co, Ni, or Fe can significantly enhance H-2 oxidation (HOR), H-2 evolution (HER), O-2 reduction (ORR), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in alkaline media. They are much more active than pure Ru catalysts for the HOR, HER, ORR, and OER, and even more active than pure Pt catalysts for the HOR and HER, but they cost much less. In particular, Ru-0.95/Co-0.05/C is the most active among all studied Ru alloys catalysts for the HOR, HER, and ORR. Thus, they are promising catalysts for alkaline fuel cells and electrolyzers. The enhancement mechanism of Ru alloys has been elucidated by density functional theory calculations.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400013

As a bifunctional catalyst, it exhibited high efficiency for direct oxidative cleavage of alkenes into ketones or their oxidation into 1,2-diketones with a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance using TBHP as the oxidant in water under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, it could be easily recovered for successive recycling without appreciable loss of activity. Mechanistic studies disclose that the direct oxidation of alkenes proceeds via the formation of an epoxide as intermediate followed by either acid-catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement to give ketones with one carbon shorter or nucleophilic ring-opening to generate 1,2-diketones in a cascade manner. This study not only opens up a fancy pathway in the rational design of Fe-N-C catalysts but also offers a simple and efficient method for accessing industrially important ketones and 1,2-diketones from alkenes in a cost-effective and environmentally benign fashion.									8	2	0	0	2	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400014

However, an efficient electrocatalyst is the key to determine the selective conversion of CO2 toward valuable products. We report herein an efficient La2CuO4 perovskite catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. A high Faradaic efficiency of 56.3% with a partial current density of 117 mA cm(-2) is achieved for methane production over this perovskite catalyst at -1.4 V (vs RHE). The results demonstrate that the structural evolution of La2CuO4 perovskite takes place simultaneously during the cathodic CO2 reduction process. Theoretical investigations further unravel that the emerging Cu/La2CuO4 interface accounts for the CO2 methanation behaviors. This work provides an effective perovskite electrocatalyst for ambient CO2 methanation and offers a valuable understanding of the structure evolution and surface reconstruction of precatalysts in catalytic reactions for energy-relevant technologies.									25	2	0	0	2	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400016

We have developed a one-step catalytic chemical vapor deposition method to grow a highly graphitized graphene nanoflake (GF)-carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid material doped simultaneously with single atoms of N, Co, and Mo (N-Co-Mo-GF/CNT). This high-surface-area material has a mesoporous structure, which facilitates oxygen mass transfer within the catalyst film, and exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity and stability in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) in alkaline media. We have shown that in this metal (M)-N-C catalyst, M (Co, Mo)-C centers are the main sites responsible for OER, while, for ORR, both M and N-C centers synergistically serve as the active sites. We systematically investigated tuning of the ORR and OER activity of the porous catalyst depending on the choice of the underlying substrate. The ORR kinetic current and OER activity for N-Co-Mo-GF/CNT were significantly enhanced when the catalyst was deposited onto a Ni substrate, resulting in an advanced electrocatalytic performance compared to the best bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts reported so far. Using a developed scanning electrochemical microscopy analysis method, we demonstrated that the higher OER reactivity on Ni was attributable to the formation of underlying catalyst/Ni interfacial sites, which are accessible due to the porous, electrolyte-permeable structure of the catalyst.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400017

Following earlier studies that characterized the broad carboxylic acid specificity of McbA, we now show that, in addition to the natural amine substrate 2-phenylethylamine, a range of simple aliphatic amines, including methylamine, butylamine, and hexylamine, and propargylamine are coupled efficiently to the native carboxylic acid substrate 1-acetyl-9H-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid by the enzyme, to give amide products with up to >99% conversion. The structure of wild-type McbA in its amidation conformation, coupled with modeling and mutational studies, reveal an amine access tunnel and a possible role for residue D201 in amine activation.

Various descriptors of perovskite catalysts have been proposed successfully for understanding either ORR or OER, but previous studies are insufficient to explain and thus boost up both ORR and OER simultaneously due to obstacles such as many different chemical compositions, structures, and metal orbital bands. Therefore, we investigate ORR/OER activities as a function of only oxygen vacancy concentration in perovskite oxides of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) to check the close relationship between delta (delta) and the electronic structure. Interestingly, the improved performance of both ORR and OER is explained by the change in the oxidation state of the transition metal caused by the increase in oxygen vacancies. Unfortunately, most previous research studies have focused on the effect of only oxygen vacancy (delta) on responsiveness. To confirm this, we performed density functional theory (DFT) analysis to find the more dominant factor on whether the activity descriptor is either delta or oxidation states of transition metals. The DFT analysis reveals that the ORR and OER activities of SSC are simultaneously improved by the reduced gap between d- and p-band centers (Delta Ed-p) caused by the raised d-band center (M-d). X-ray absorption spectroscopy has provided the exact electronic states of all the transition metals. Here, we report that an important factor of ORR/OER is affected only by the oxidation state of the transition metal in the perovskite oxide, not by the oxygen vacancy concentration.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400019

A metal honeycomb that was fabricated using a metal foil catalyst successfully demonstrated a light-off performance at a practical gas hourly space velocity of 1.2 x 10(5) h(-1). Despite its nonporosity and small surface area, the Pt overlayer is a promising alternative to Pt/Al2O3 for more efficient ammonia-slip catalysts that use less Pt loading; this is because the turnover frequency for the NH3 oxidation at 200 degrees C is more than 180-fold greater than that achieved with Pt/Al2O3 consisting of Pt nanoparticles. Although the nanometric Pt overlayer structure was thermally unstable at reaction temperatures of >= 600 degrees C, inserting a 250 nm-thick Zr buffer layer between the Pt overlayer and the metal foil substrate significantly mitigated the thermal deterioration. The undesired byproducts of NH3 oxidation, NO and NO2, can be efficiently converted to N-2 by a selective catalytic reduction over a V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst in a tandem reactor system.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400021

However, the versatile structure and complex redox activity of this material entangle uncovering structure-activity relationships and distinguishing active species from spectators. In this work, we monitored the dynamic structure of the active sites in a catalyst containing highly dispersed copper-oxo species on ceria during low-temperature CO oxidation using time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We quantitatively demonstrate that the CO oxidation mechanism below 90 degrees C involves an oxygen intermediate strongly bound to the active sites as well as the redox activity of Cu2+/Cu+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ couples. The redox activity of cerium is much lower than that of copper; however, both metals change their oxidation states in concert, indicating that oxygen activation involves copper-oxo species in close interaction with ceria. In addition to short-lived Cu+ and Ce3+ intermediates that are generated in the CO oxidation cycle, long-lived Cu+ and Ce3+ species appear in the catalyst under the working conditions. We demonstrate that they do not participate in the main low-temperature CO oxidation mechanism, which is mediated by a strongly bound oxygen intermediate. Finally, our results confirm the high potential of element-specific time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy methods combined with a non-steady-state experimental strategy to uncover the mechanisms of catalytic processes in complex multicomponent systems.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400023

The reaction capitalizes on the use of fluorinated alcohol solvents such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), which exert a strong polarity reversal in the hydroxyl moieties of 1,2-diols via hydrogen bonding, in turn translating into a strong deactivation of proximal C-H bonds against a HAT initiated oxidation by the putative high-valent and electrophilic metal-oxo species. As a result, site-selective and product chemoselective oxidation of complex polyfunctional molecules such as steroids, sugars, and pharmaceuticals is described, where exclusive or predominant C-H bond hydroxylation at a remote and nonactivated site takes place. The current report discloses HAT initiated hydroxylations in fluorinated alcohol solvents as methods displaying orthogonal chemoselectivity to contemporary alcohol oxidations providing a useful tool for synthetic planning in densely functionalized molecules.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400024

IDSs are divided into trans- and cis-IDS superfamilies depending on the configuration of the resulting carbon-carbon double bonds. Compared with trans-IDSs, cis-IDS family members exhibit more variable active site structure and versatile function. The archetypal cis-IDSs are homodimers and produce linear isoprenoids via headto-tail condensation. Recently, heterodimeric cis-IDSs containing a noncatalytic subunit that also belongs to the cis-IDS superfamily have been identified. Moreover, several cis-IDS-fold members have been found to produce nonlinear isoprenoids via "head-to-middle" condensation. In this Review, we summarize the structural features and catalytic mechanism of the versatile cis-IDS superfamily. This information biosynthesis of important natural products and medical intermediates, cellular provides important guidance for research regarding metabolism, and disease control.									5	1	0	0	2	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400026

Herein, we present an atomic-scale dispersed Co-N species anchored Co@C hybrid structure (entitled as Co@ CoN&C) that regulates catalytic properties in thermodynamic and kinetic processes to achieve active and highly selective CO yield in the photothermal CO2 reduction. An optimal sample delivers the maximum yield rate of 132 mmol g(cat)(-1)h(-1) and remarkable CO selectivity (91.1%), while the undesirable methanation activity, compared with typical Co nanoparticles (NPs), was suppressed. The mechanism study suggests that the CO2 Adsorption- strong photon-matter interaction over graphitic-carbon and Co NPs can enhance the light-to-heat conversion efficiency and thus induce the high work temperature, which is thermodynamically beneficial for CO2 activation and subsequently promoted the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the carbon layers improve the adsorption of CO2, and the surface atomically dispersed Co-N species weakens hydrogenation capability, which kinetically controls the reaction pathway and therefore attains the high selectivity for CO production. This study exemplifies that the microstructure design can modulate the thermodynamic and kinetic factors of photochemical reaction and thereby achieve potential solar-to-chemical energy conversion.									22	2	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400027

Their application in homogeneous transition-metal catalysis has led to many new amidation reactions. Dioxazolones are typically activated by transition metals at relatively low reaction temperatures. The metal nitrenoids formed by decarboxylative activation of dioxazolones are generally electron deficient and commonly react in a concerted fashion. "Intermolecular" nitrene insertion reactions involving preactivated C-H bonds ("innersphere" mechanism) easily compete with the Curtius-type rearrangement, but for intramolecular "direct" nitrene transfer/insertion reactions involving nonpreactivated substrates (i.e., without preceding formation of metal-carbon or metal-hydride bonds) extensive ligand optimization is important to prevent such unwanted side reactions. The ease of dioxazolone synthesis, formation of CO2 gas as the sole byproduct from reactions with dioxazolones, and the importance of nitrene transfer reactions in general has led to the development of several interesting reactions producing N-aryl amides, oxazoles, and lactams. Since the activation of dioxazolones proceeds under mild reaction conditions, stereo- and enantioselective reactions are also possible, which is useful for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen-containing compounds. This review provides an overview of these reactions reported in recent years.									39	2	0	0	9	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400029

In this work, we demonstrate that tailoring types of acid sites of zeolite-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and choosing solvents provide a compelling strategy to manipulate product distribution in tandem catalysis. The model tandem furfural conversion with acetone and ethanol (EtOH) is investigated in cyclohexane and EtOH solvents. Pt NPs encapsulated in ZSM-5 with Bronsted acid sites (BAS) only located in intracrystalline mesopores selectively mediate the tandem aldol condensation and subsequent hydrogenation of furfural and acetone by limiting the access of furfural to Pt sites and promoting the aldol condensation. A combined yield of 69% toward hydrogenated aldol adducts is achieved. In contrast, furfural hydrogenation to valeric acid (VA) and ethyl valerate (EV) dominates with a combined yield of 80% on Pt NPs encapsulated in ZSM-5 with Lewis acid sites (LAS) and BAS in both zeolitic micropores and intracrystalline mesopores. The concentration of EtOH in the reaction system is identified as another key parameter in selectivity control: (1) low EtOH concentrations (EtOH to furfural ratio of <5) suppress the catalytic transfer hydrogenation pathway and favor the formation of 2-methylfuran (MF) from furfural, as most hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps occur on Pt NPs, (2) modest EtOH concentrations (EtOH to furfural ratio of 5-10) favor VA/EV by enabling the catalytic transfer hydrogenation pathway in zeolitic micropores and exposing intermediates to BAS prior to Pt NPs, and (3) high EtOH concentrations (EtOH to furfural ratio of >10) suppress the production of VA/EV by excessive water formation via acid-catalyzed etherification of EtOH. Therefore, tailoring the nature of active sites and changing the solvent composition are both effective strategies in manipulating the product distribution in tandem catalysis.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400030

In this work, the inhibiting role of CO on the chemistry responsible for the abatement of methane (CH4) is studied on a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst using a multitechnique approach combined with modulated excitation and mass spectrometry to obtaiun operando conditions. Identical modulation experi- ments were performed using X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption, and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy by pulsing alternately CH4 and O-2 or CH4 + CO and O-2 at 320 degrees C in the absence of steam. During the O-2 pulse, reoxidation of metallic Pd was observed to occur in two steps that are associated with the initial formation of a surface layer followed by crystalline PdO. The time-resolved study showed that reduction is faster than oxidation and that it is promoted by the presence of CO. Beside determining the redox properties of the catalyst under these conditions, the presence of hydrides and Pd carbide-like species could be followed by exploiting phase-sensitive detection and its power to enhance subtle changes in the spectroscopy and diffraction data. While at the beginning of the reduction pulse CO2 was produced from reaction of CH4 with PdO, CH4 decomposition occurred on reduced Pd within the reduction pulse. In the presence of CO, CH4 oxidation at the beginning of the reduction pulse was significantly limited by reaction of CO with PdO and by blockage of the accessible Pd surface by CO adsorption.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400033

Here, we report the extracellular production of MHETase in an active form with a proper folding. Based on the structural observations and biochemical experiments, we reveal that MHETase also functions as exo-PETase by hydrolyzing the synthesized PET pentamer. We further present that MHETase has a hydrolysis activity against the termini-generated PET film, demonstrating the exo-PETase function of the enzyme. We also develop a MHETase(R411K/S416A/F424I) variant with a higher BHET activity, and the variant exhibits an enhanced degradation activity against the PET film. Based on these results, we propose that MHETase plays several roles in the biodegradation of PET using the BHETase and exo-PETase activities as well as the MHET hydrolysis function.									10	0	0	0	6	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400034

Mechanistic studies show that acetone, 3-pentanone, and mesityl oxide reduce [(DTBNpP)PdCl2](2) in the presence of NaO-t-Bu to Pd-0(DTBNpP)(2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000015

A Potential Role of Cationic Cobalt(I) Intermediates								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4337	4348		10.1021/acscatal.9b05455				APR 3 2020	2020	Coupling reactions of feedstock alkenes are promising, but few of these reactions are practiced industrially. Even though recent advances in the synthetic methodology have led to excellent regio- and enantioselectivies in the dimerization reactions between 1,3-dienes and acrylates, the efficiency as measured by the turnover numbers (TONs) in the catalyst has remained modest. Through a combination of reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) of a prototypical dimerization reaction and characterization of isolated low-valent cobalt catalyst precursors involved, several important details of the mechanism of this reaction have emerged. (i) The prototypical reaction has an induction period that requires at least 2 h of stir time to generate the competent catalyst. (ii) Reduction of a Co(II) complex to a Co(I) complex and subsequent generation of a cationic [Co-(I)](+) species are responsible for this delay. (iii) Through RPKA using in situ infrared spectroscopy, same excess experiments reveal inhibition by the product toward the end of the reaction, and no catalyst deactivation is observed as long as the diene is present in the medium. The low TON observed is most likely the result of the inherent instability of the putative cationic Co(I) species that catalyzes the reaction. (iv) Different excess experiments suggest that the reaction is first order in the diene and zero order in the acrylate. (v) Catalyst loading experiments show that the catalyst is first order. The orders in the various regents were further confirmed by variable time normalization analysis. (vi) A mechanism based on oxidative dimerization [via Co(I)/Co(III)-cycle] is proposed. Based on the results of this study, it is possible to increase the TON by a factor of 10 by conducting the reaction at an increased concentration of the starting materials, especially the diene, which seems to stabilize the catalytic species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000037	32457820

Here, we report a simple, scalable, and reproducible strategy to prepare 2D phosphate nanosheets by forming a layered structure in situ from phytic acid (PTA) and transition metal precursors. Controlled combustion of the organic groups of PTA results in interlayer carbon, which keeps the layers apart during the formation of phosphate, and the removal of this carbon results in ultrathin nanosheets with controllable layers. Applying this concept to vanadyl phosphate synthesis, we show that the method yields 2D ultrathin nanosheets of the orthorhombic beta-form, exposing abundant V4+/V5+ redox sites and oxygen vacancies. We demonstrate the high catalytic activity of this material in the vapor-phase aerobic oxidation of ethyl lactate to ethyl pyruvate. Importantly, these beta-VOPO4 compounds do not get hydrated, thereby reducing the competing hydrolysis reaction by water byproducts. The result has superior selectivity to ethyl pyruvate compared to analogous vanadyl phosphates. The catalysts are highly stable, maintaining a steady-state conversion of similar to 90% (with >80% selectivity) for at least 80 h on stream. This "self-exfoliated" synthesis protocol opens opportunities for preparing structurally diverse metal phosphates for catalysis and other applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000002	32953234	
J	Kopac, Drejc; Likozar, Blaz; Hus, Matej								How Size Matters: Electronic, Cooperative, and Geometric Effect in Perovskite-Supported Copper Catalysts for CO2 Reduction								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4092	4102		10.1021/acscatal.9b05303				APR 3 2020	2020	In heterogeneous catalysis, bifunctional catalysts often outperform one-component catalysts. The activity is also strongly influenced by the morphology, size, and distribution of catalytic particles. For CO2 hydrogenation, the size of the active copper area on top of the SrTiO3 perovskite catalyst support can affect the activity, selectivity, and stability. Here, a detailed theoretical study of the effect of bifunctionality on an important chemical CO2 transformation reaction, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, is presented. Using density functional theory computation results for the RWGS pathway on three surfaces, namely, Cu(111), SrTiO3, and the Cu/SrTiO3 interface between both solid phases, we construct the energy landscape of the reaction. The adsorbate-adsorbate lateral interactions are taken into account for catalytic surfaces, which show a sufficient intermediate coverage. The mechanism, combining all three surfaces, is used in mesoscale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to study the turnover and yield for CO production as a function of particle size. It is shown that the reaction proceeds faster at the interface. However, including copper and the support sites in addition to the interface accelerates the conversion even further, showing that the bifunctionality of the catalyst manifests in a more complex interplay between the phases than just the interface effect, such as the hydrogen spillover. We identify three distinct effects, the electronic, cooperative, and geometric effects, and show that the surrounded smaller Cu features on the set of supporting SrTiO3 show a higher CO formation rate, resulting in a decreasing RWGS model trend with the increasing Cu island size. The findings are in parallel with experiments, showing that they explain the previously observed phenomena and confirming the size sensitivity for the catalytic RWGS reaction.									12	1	0	0	2	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000012	32953235

However, the kinetically sluggish AOR has prohibitively hindered the attractive direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC) applications. Here, we report an efficient AOR catalyst, in which ternary PtIrNi alloy nanoparticles well dispersed on a binary composite support consisting of porous silicon dioxide (SiO2) and carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotube (PtIrNi/SiO2-CNT-COOH) through a sonochemical-assisted synthesis method. The PtIrNi alloy nanoparticles, with the aid of abundant OHad provided by porous SiO2 and the improved electrical conductivity by CNTs, exhibit remarkable catalytic activity for the AOR in alkaline media. It is evidenced by a lower onset potential (similar to 0.40 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) at room temperature than that of commercial PtIr/C (ca. 0.43 V vs RHE). Increasing NH3 concentrations and operation temperatures can significantly enhance AOR activity of this PtIrNi nanoparticle catalyst. Specifically, the catalyst at the temperature of 80 degrees C exhibits a much lower onset potential (similar to 0.32 V vs RHE) and a higher peak current density, indicating that DAFCs operated at a higher temperature are favorable for increased performance. Constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the Pt-Ir ensembles on {100}-terminated surfaces serve as the active site. The introduction of Ni raises the center energy of the density of states projected onto the group d-orbitals of surface sites and thus lowers the theoretical onset potential for *NH2 dehydrogenation to *NH compared to Pt and Pt3Ir alloy.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000001

Herein, we report a facile citric acid-assisted hydrothermal process for the fabrication of porous Fe-doped CeO2 with flower-like morphology that can drastically promote the catalytic activities of CeO, with high durability. Among the synthesized catalysts, the one with well-defined (110) and (100) planes is highly active for H,S-selective oxidation with H2S conversion and sulfur selectivity of almost 100% at 220 degrees C, superior to most of the reported Cebased catalysts. Meanwhile, outstanding catalytic stability is achieved because the presence of Fe ions alleviates ceria deactivation due to sulfation. The results of systematic investigation prove that the doping of Fe not only raises the density of oxygen vacancies but also promotes the redox ability and oxygen activity of the catalyst. We conducted in situ DRIFTS (diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to disclose the reaction mechanism of H,S oxidation. The derived insights are important for the design of efficient ceria-related catalysts for practical applications.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000003

Here, we analyzed the activity of Cu and Fe sites with various nuclearities and coordinations in *BEA zeolites toward complete oxidation of methane, toluene, and ethanol by molecular oxygen. Spectral analysis of the interaction of methane with the individual Cu and Fe sites and a kinetic study show that the oxidation of methane is catalyzed by different active sites with different activation energies. In the low-temperature region (225-325 degrees C), the activity is primarily caused by reactive bridging oxygen atoms in dimeric Cu and Fe clusters. Isolated Fe3+-oxo ions in the octahedral coordination and Cu2+ partially charge-balanced by the framework with less rigid redox states contribute to the activity at higher temperatures of >= 350 degrees C. The isolated Fe3+-oxo ions tetrahedrally coordinated to the framework oxygen and the bare Cu2+ ions charge-balanced exclusively by the framework are strongly stabilized and cannot act as active sites. Oxidation of the hydrocarbons over both the dimeric and isolated Cu and Fe active sites is nonspecific with practically barrierless consecutive reactions of already activated molecules and therefore fully CO2-selective for all of the hydrocarbons in an excess of oxygen.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000004

The chemical state of surface Ce, which is associated with Lewis acidity and hence the adsorption/activation energy of reactants on the surface, is expected to vary with their hosted facets. Unfortunately, traditional surface tools fail to differentiate/quantify them among hosted facets and thus have led to different interpretations among researchers in the past decades. Herein, probe-assisted nuclear magnetic resonance is employed for the surface investigation of different CeO2 facets. They not only allow differentiation of the surface Ce atoms between hosted facets at high resolution but can also provide their corresponding concentrations. The as-established facet fingerprint of CeO2 can thus report on the facet distribution/concentration of a given CeO2 sample. Dephosphorylation and H2O2 reduction were tested as probe reactions to demonstrate the importance of obtaining comprehensive surface Ce information for the active site identification and the rational design of CeO2-based catalysts. Around 1000 and 4500% increase in activity of those reactions can be easily achieved on pristine CeO2 without further surface engineering when its terminal facet is wisely chosen. Our results thus imply that the basic surface knowledge of even a simple catalyst can be more important than the continuous development of their fancy derivatives without clear guidance.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000005

Transition-metal-based electrocatalysts, which provide the possibility for the realization of low-cost, high-activity, and stable OER in alkaline solution, therefore have attracted significant research interest in recent years. A fundamental understanding of composition-structure-activity relationships for these electrocatalysts is essential to guide the design of practical electrocatalysts for industrial applications. With more advanced ex situ and in situ techniques to determine the active sites, there has been increasing evidence revealing the critical role of Fe in the high performance of Fe-containing transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Here, we present a critical review of recent progress in Fe-containing electrocatalysts for OER, highlighting the significant role of Fe in enhancing the OER activity. We outline the historical development of the Fe-containing electrocatalysts, summarize the conflicting viewpoints on catalytic active sites, and offer guidelines for more rigorous identification. The synthesis techniques and the major challenges in improving the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability are discussed. Finally, a perspective regarding emerging issues yet to be explored for developing OER electrocatalysts for practical applications are also provided.									105	1	0	0	6	0	106			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000007

One promising route to lowering the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is to reduce it to useful small molecules via photoelectrocatalytic hydrogenation, which would enable solar energy storage with a zero-carbon emission cycle and perform a more efficient separation of the photogenerated electron and hole pair than pure photocatalysis. Indeed, photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction has been an intense focus of research. Using the density functional theory (DFT), we studied the CO2 reduction reaction on the defective anatase TiO2 (101) surface, at both the solvent/catalyst and the electrolyte/catalyst interfaces. The analysis of the electronic structure of the surface shows a contrast between the solvent/catalyst and the electrolyte/catalyst interfaces, which results in the two corresponding catalytic cycles being distinct. Our study explains at the electronic and mechanistic levels why methanol is the main product in the presence of the electrolyte and why the overpotential is not only controlled by the reaction process but also by the diffusion process.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000008

For instance, adding a CO-selective cocatalyst like Ag to Cu shifts the latter's CO(2)R1z,selectiiiity toward C-2 products, but the underlying cause of the change is unclear. Herein, we show that, during CO2RR, the abundant CO availability at Cu Ag boundaries facilitates C-C coupling on Cu to selectively generate ethanol through an therwise closed pathway. Oxide-derived Cu nanowires mixed with 20 rim Ag particles (Cu:Ag mule ratio of 1:20) catalyzed CO2 reduction Vto ethanol with a maximum current density of 4.1 tnA/cm(2) and ethanol/ethylene Faradaic efficiency ratio of 1.1 at 1.1 vs RHE.

Ni doping has been shown to improve the catalytic activity and produces active sites for the decomposition of methane. In this work, Ni:CZO NPs were synthesized via a two-step co-precipitation/molten salt synthesis to compare Ni distribution, oxygen vacancy concentration, and catalytic activity relative to a reference state-of-the-art catalyst prepared by a sol-gel-adsorptive deposition technique. To better understand the dispersion of Ni and oxygen vacancy formation in these materials, the Ni concentration, position, and reaction time were varied in the synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show a homogeneous, cubic phase with little to no segregation of Ni/NiO. Catalytic activity measurements, performed via a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)/thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method, displayed a 5-fold increase in the activity per surface area with an order of magnitude decrease in the coking rate for the particles synthesized by the molten salt method. Additionally, this approach resulted in an order of magnitude increase in oxygen vacancies, which is attributed to the high dispersion of Ni2+ ions in the NP core. This ability of controlling the oxygen vacancies in the lattice is expected to impact other such systems, which utilize the substrate redox cyclability to drive conversion via, e.g., a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000010

Surprisingly, the exact chemical mechanism is still widely discussed in the literature. In order to disentangle photochemical from thermal reaction steps and gain insights on the atomic level, we use a Pt cluster-loaded TiO2(110) photocatalyst in very well-defined environments. Using Auger electron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption/reaction, isotopic labeling, and isothermal photoreactions, it is possible to identify the surface species present on the catalyst under photocatalytic conditions. Furthermore, an initial conditioning of the photocatalyst is observed and attributed to thermal dehydrogenation of methanol to CO species on the cluster. The analysis of the isothermal photoreactions reveals that the photo-oxidation kinetics are not significantly affected by cocatalyst loading. The observed conversion and product distribution of formaldehyde and methyl formate can be rationalized with kinetic parameters gained from the bare TiO2(110) crystal. The work leads to a detailed mechanistic understanding of the surface species and paves the way for an educated microkinetic modeling approach, which may be extended to a variety of noble metal cocatalysts and other TiO2 modifications.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000011		
J	Wei, Xing; Yin, Zhenglei; Lyu, Kangjie; Li, Zhen; Gong, Jun; Wang, Gongwei; Xiao, Li; Lu, Juntao; Zhuang, Lin								Highly Selective Reduction of CO2 to C2+ Hydrocarbons at Copper/Polyaniline Interfaces								ACS CATALYSIS				10	7			4103	4111		10.1021/acscatal.0c00049				APR 3 2020	2020	Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to liquid fuels and valued chemicals is a meaningful approach to decreasing CO2 emissions and alleviating the energy crisis. In particular, the conversion of CO2 into multicarbon products is of technological significance. Cu is the only transition metal that is able to catalyze the CO2RR to produce C2+ hydrocarbons, but the catalytic selectivity of pristine Cu is low. Herein we report a facile method to largely enhance the C2+ selectivity of polycrystalline Cu toward the CO2RR. By coating the Cu surface with a 50 nm thick film of polyaniline (PANI), the faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ hydrocarbons was increased from ca. 15% to 60% at -1.1 VRHE in KHCO3 solutions. When applying the PANI coating onto Cu nanoparticles, the FE of C2+ hydrocarbons can even reach 80%, with the FE of ethylene over 40%. Such performance remained stable in a test period of 20 h. The superiority of the Cu/PANI interface is not due to the change in the morphology or the electronic properties of the Cu substrate but instead is due to an improvement in the coverage and interaction of the CO intermediate, which facilitates the CO-CO coupling, as revealed by in situ infrared spectroscopy. This study opens an avenue to tuning the catalytic activity and selectivity of Cu toward the CO2RR, not through the structure of the catalyst but through the environment above the surface.									46	1	0	0	3	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000013

Microkinetic models formulated using DFT energetics derived on the clean Pt(100) and Pt(111) required large parameter adjustments to reproduce the experimentally measured apparent activation energies and reaction orders. Further, these models predicted high surface coverage of adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO*), inconsistent with the environment of the active site in the DFT calculations on the clean surfaces. Consequently, we reperformed DFT calculations for the entire reaction network on partially CO*-covered (4/9 monolayer, ML) Pt(111) and Pt(100). The resultant microkinetic models, with thermochemistry and kinetics explicitly dependent on CO* coverage, were able to reproduce the experimentally determined activation energies and reaction orders, in addition to being self-consistent in CO* coverage. Our results suggest that Pt(100) is likely poisoned by CO* under typical reaction conditions and does not contribute significantly to the experimentally observed reactivity. Instead, we find that Pt(111) better represents the active site for FA decomposition reaction on Pt/C catalysts. The optimized model on 4/9 ML CO*covered Pt(111) suggests that the reaction occurs via the carboxyl (COOH*) intermediate and that the spectator CO*-assisted pathways play a significant role under reaction conditions. This study underscores the importance of spectator species on the energetics and the mechanism of a catalytic reaction and their key role in developing a model that better addresses the nature of the active site under realistic catalytic reaction conditions.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000014

Kinetic studies, isotopic labeling experiments with O-18(2), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) were applied to explore the reaction mechanism and the surface of the catalyst before and after reductive pretreatments. It was found that pure iron oxide was catalytically active in CO oxidation, and experimental evidence for a Mars van Krevelen mechanism between CO and lattice O was found. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) for small Pt NPs (<= 3 nm) supported on iron oxide and normalized to the number of Pt atoms located at the periphery of the Pt-support interface were similar under reaction conditions, indicating that the reaction mainly proceeds at the interface. However, with increasing particle size, the contribution of a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism of chemisorbed CO and O-2 in addition to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism increases. After reductive pretreatment, the activity of the catalyst decreased significantly, which could be related to partial encapsulation of the monometallic Pt NPs with FeOx. To study whether also on the nanoscale an interaction between Pt and iron oxide similar to the beneficial or detrimental SMSI effect observed for the Pt particles supported on iron oxide can also be achieved, bimetallic Fe-Pt NPs of a mean size of 3-4 nm were deposited on inert Al2O3. It could be shown that surface segregation of Fe and formation of FeOx after reduction and exposure to oxygen took place. As a result, the activity of bimetallic NPs decreased due to loss of active Pt surface, revealing an effect similar to the detrimental SMSI detected for Pt NPs on FeOx support after reductive pretreatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000016

Its metabolite, (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine, has been found to have a similar antidepressant effect but with less undesirable side effects, which make this compound an interesting target for synthesis. Using the first-sphere mutagenesis of the cytochrome P450 154E1 from Thermobifida fusca YX, we constructed a triple mutant that enables the effective production of (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine from (S)-ketamine. This engineered P450 monooxygenase catalyzes the consecutive oxidative N-demethylation and highly regio- and stereoselective C6-hydroxylation reactions leading directly to the desired product with 85% product selectivity. The integration of this selective monooxygenase into an Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst allowed the production of (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine at a semipreparative scale. The metabolite was purified and its structure was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000017
